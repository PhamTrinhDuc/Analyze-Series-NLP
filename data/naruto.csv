Naruto," (Laughing) Give it up. (Shows the stone faces drawn on with different coloured paints.) You’re just bent, because you didn’t have the guts to do what I do. Do ya!? Losers! Wanabees! You’ll never catch me! (Laughs)"
Hiruzen," (Turns away from his writing) I hope you’re not bothering me with some trivia, and don’t tell me its Naruto again."
Ninja, Naseer Sabah
Ninja, is the best person on earth
Naruto, muah
Iruka," (In Naruto’s ear) Oh yeah, Naruto!?"
Naruto," Where’d you come from, Iruka Sensei!? What are you doing here?"
Iruka," (Points at Naruto) No, what are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in class."
Iruka," (Arms folded) I’m at the end of my rope, Naruto. You failed the graduation test last time, and the time before that. Tomorrow you’ve got another chance, and you’re messing up again! (Naruto humps, looking away. Iruka, angry, points at the class) Fine! Because you missed it, Naruto, everyone will review the Transformation Jutsu!"
Sakura," Alright, Sakura here. Let’s do it. Transform! (Smoke comes up around her, then disappears, revealing her transformation into Iruka.)"
Iruka, Transformed into me. Good.
Sakura," (Transforms back, excited) Yes! I did it! Yes!"
Inner Sakura," Yeah, I kicked butt!!"
Sakura, Yes!
Sakura," (Turns) Sasuke, did you see that? (Walks down the line)"
Iruka, Next. Sasuke Uchiha.
Iruka," Uh, good."
Iruka, Next. Naruto Uzumaki.
Shikamaru," This is a total waste of time, Naruto."
Ino, We always pay for your screw ups.
Naruto, Like I care.
Hinata, (Thinking) Naruto. Do your best.
Naruto," (Puts his hands together) Transform! (Smoke goes up around Naruto, then goes down a little, revealing a naked girl, the smoke covering certain spots, and blows a kiss)"
Iruka," Huh!? (Staring, shocked, knocked back)"
Naruto, Gotcha! That’s my Sexy Jutsu!
Iruka, (Yelling) Cut the stupid tricks! This is your last warning!
Naruto, This sucks. Loser.
Iruka,"(Arms crossed, sitting on top of the stone faces) You’re not going home till you’ve cleaned off every single drop of paint."
Naruto," (Stops scrubbing, looks up) So what? It’s not like there’s anyone waiting at home for me. (Goes back to scrubbing)"
Iruka, (Iruka looks down at Naruto) Naruto?
Naruto," (Looks up, eyes narrow and a pout on his face) What do you want now, Sensei?"
Iruka," Well, I was just thinking. Maybe after you clean this all up I can take you out for some ramen. The good stuff. What do you think? (Looks down at Naruto)"
Naruto, (Has a huge smile on his face. Beyond happy with that) Now that’s some serious motivation! I’ll have this clean in no time!
Iruka, Naruto?
Naruto, (Mouthful of noodles.) Mmmm...
Iruka," Why would you do that to the Hokage faces? I mean, you know who the Hokage are, don’t you?"
Naruto," Course I do. (Slurps more ramen. Then finishes the whole bowl, letting out a sigh afterwards.) Everybody knows. They were the greatest Shinobi of their time, right? The best of the best. Undefeated Ninja champs. (Naruto pictures the stone face of the Fourth Hokage, that he’d painted on)  And the Fourth Hokage’s the one who saved the village from the Nine-Tailed Fox. He was the most amazing."
Iruka, Then why did you...?
Naruto," Cause I’m going to be greater than any of them. Me. Naruto. The next Hokage! (Points his chopsticks) A Ninja legend! Then everyone will have to stop disrespecting me, and look up to me. Believe it! (pause. Iruka sucks up the noodle hanging out of the corner of his mouth.) Uh, by the way, I kinda wanna ask a little favour, Sensei."
Iruka, You want another bowl?
Naruto," (Shakes his head) Uh-uh. I... want to try on your headband. Come on, Please!? (Bows his head; begging)"
Iruka, Uh... (Motions to his headband) Oh this? No way. You can only wear the Leaf Headband when you finally graduate from the academy and become a Ninja. You’ve gotta pass the test tomorrow.
Naruto, That is so uncool! (Pouts)
Iruka, (Laughs) Hey? Is that why you took off your goggles?
Naruto, Ugh...! I want another bowl!
Iruka," We will now start the final exam. When your name is called, proceed to the testing room. The final test will be on... The Clone Jutsu."
Naruto, (Hands to his head; Thinking) Ugh! That’s my worst technique! Great. I’m never gonna pass!
Naruto," (Thinking) Alright. Get it together, Naruto. You can do this. (Puts his fingers together) Believe it. (Wind picks up around Naruto. Out loud) Clone Jutsu!"
Iruka, You fail!! (Naruto flips out) Hmm...
Mizuki," Iruka Sensei? (Iruka looks at him) He’s off, but his moves weren’t bad and he did hang in there and replicate. This is his third try, so you know he really wants to become a Ninja. We could cut him a break. (Naruto looks hopeful) And pass him."
Iruka, Mizuki Sensei. The other students created at least three effective replications. But Naruto could only create one. (Shot goes to Naruto’s clone) And look at it. It’s pitiful. (Naruto is shaking with anger) I can’t pass him.
Kid, You see that? They called me first.
Kid, I passed with flying colours.
Mother, (Off camera) Congratulations. I’m going to make you all of your favourites tonight. We’ll have a feast!
Ibara," There, you see him?"
Tsubaki, It’s that boy. I heard he’s the only one who failed.
Ibara, Hmph! Well it serves him right.
Tsubaki," Just imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja. (Naruto pulls his goggles down to cover his face.) I mean, he’s the boy who..."
Ibara, Shh... We’re not allowed to talk about that.
Hiruzen, Iruka. There is something we need to talk about.
Mizuki," Iruka Sensei is tough. But, he’s not against you."
Naruto, Then why? Why only me?
Mizuki," He wants you to be strong. With all his heart. But that will never happen if he goes easy on you. He’s like you, you know. No parents. No family."
Naruto, (Sad. Glum)  But... This time I really wanted to graduate.
Mizuki, (Chuckles quietly) Then I guess I’ll have to tell you.
Naruto, (Looks at him) Huh?
Mizuki, It’s a secret. But I’m gonna let you in on it.
Naruto," (Eyes wide, thinking) A secret?"
Hiruzen, Iruka.
Iruka," What is it, Lord Hokage?"
Hiruzen, I know how you feel. You grew up just like Naruto. Without knowing the love of a Mother and Father. The warmth of a family.
Ninja, It’s getting closer! Don’t let it near the village!
Young Iruka, Let me go! My Mom and Dad are still fighting back there! Ah!!!
Mizuki, Iruka Sensei. Wake up!
Iruka, What? What is it?
Mizuki, You need to come to Lord Hokage’s right away. It’s Naruto. He stole the Sacred Scroll.
Iruka, (Shocked) You mean the Scroll of Sealing? No!
Naruto," Let’s see... The first one is... Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu. (Puts a hand to his head, frustrated) Ah! Not this again. It’s my worst Jutsu!"
Iwana, The scroll contains secrets that were sealed by the first Hokage. Secrets known only to our village.
Yajirobee," If it falls into the wrong hands, they could destroy our entire way of life."
Hiruzen, Alright. Bring Naruto here at once!
s, Sir!
Iruka, (Thinking) Where would he go?
Mizuki," (Thinking) Now that I told everyone what Naruto did, I can eliminate him. They’ll be glad he’s gone. (Smiling evilly) And of course I keep the scroll for myself."
Iruka, It’s all over. (laughs)
Iruka, Huh?
Naruto," Got me already? Not bad. You’re quick, Sensei. I only had time to learn one technique."
Iruka, (Thinking) He’s been out here practicing. I can tell how hard he’s been working.
Naruto," (Happy) Listen, Iruka Sensei! I’m going to show you this amazing Jutsu and you’re going to let me graduate and everything will be okay. That’s the way it works, right? Anyone who learns Jutsu from this scroll passes."
Iruka, Huh? Where’d you get that idea?
Naruto," Mizuki Sensei told me about it. Believe it. (Turns to show the scroll on his back) He told me where to find the scroll... (Turns back to Iruka) ... And this place... (Naruto stops, noticing Iruka’s shocked face)"
Iruka, (Thinking) Huuh? Mizuki?
Iruka, Look out!
Mizuki, I see you’ve found our little hide away.
Iruka," (Looks up) So that’s the way it is, huh? I should’ve known."
Mizuki," Naruto! Give me the scroll, now!"
Naruto," Wait a minute... (looks over at Iruka, then back at Mizuki) What’s going on here? (Looks back at Iruka)"
Iruka," (Panting, pulls out the Kunai in his leg and throws it aside.) Naruto! Don’t let Mizuki get the scroll! (Mizuki is standing, looking down) It contains forbidden Jutsu, that could put this village in grave danger. Mizuki used you to get the scroll for himself. For his own power."
Mizuki, Naruto. (Holds out his hand) Iruka’s just trying to scare you cause he doesn’t want you to have the scroll.
Naruto, Huh? (Looks at Iruka)
Iruka," Stop lying, Mizuki. (Looks at Naruto) Don’t let him trick you, Naruto."
Mizuki," (Laughs) Oh, I’ll tell  you who’s really lying."
Iruka," No, Mizuki!"
Mizuki," They’ve been lying to you your whole life, Naruto. Since the decree 12 years ago."
Naruto, What decree?
Mizuki, Everyone knows except you. Iruka’s trying to hide it from you now. He’d do anything to shut me up.
Naruto," (looking up at Mizuki, wide eyed) What is this decree? Why does everyone else know about it?"
Iruka, Don’t tell him! It’s forbidden!
Mizuki," The decree is, no one can tell you the Nine-Tailed Fox is inside you! (Naruto stares, shocked) The Fox spirit that killed Iruka’s parents and destroyed our village has taken over your body. You are the Nine-Tailed Fox!"
Iruka, (Yelling) Stop it!
Mizuki," They’ve all been sneaking around, hiding things from you your whole life. Didn’t you think it was strange how they treated you? Like dirt. Like they hated you for just being alive."
Naruto," (Tears in his eyes) No...! (Naruto’s hands are out at his sides, and wind has come up around him) No, no, no, no!"
Iruka, Naruto...
Mizuki, That’s why you’ll never be accepted in this village. Even your beloved Sensei hates your guts!
Hiruzen," Iruka. Naruto never had a Mother or Father to care for him. He’s shut out of everything and doesn’t know why. Most people won’t even look at him. How would you feel if everywhere you went, people turned their backs on you? (Shows the desecrated stone faces) That’s why he gets in trouble. So people would notice him. It may not show, but he’s always thinking about the family he doesn’t have. He’s hurting inside."
Mizuki," Die, Naruto! (Throws the Shuriken)"
Iruka, Naruto! Get Down!
Naruto, W-Why?
Iruka," Because we’re the same. (Iruka remembers back to when he was a kid, with no parents) When I lost my parents, no one seemed to care. They didn’t have time for me. They just forgot I was there. (You see a young Iruka, trying to cross water on a rope, but he’s acting stupid, losing his balance. The other kids are laughing) My grades dropped. I became the class clown. (Young Iruka falls into the water, then he comes back up) I just wanted them to see me... (The young Iruka laughs, scratching his head, and the rest of the kids laugh) ... And know my name. My school wasn’t good enough to get the attention, so I did crazy things (Young Iruka sitting in the corner of a room, by himself) And then I had to pay for it. It was hard. (Back to the forest. Naruto is looking up at Iruka. Tears fall down onto Naruto’s cheek) I know that’s how you feel, Naruto. (Iruka is crying) You feel lonely and it hurts inside. And I could’ve been there for you more. (Naruto sits up a little) I let you down. I’m sorry. No one should have to suffer that much. No one should be alone like that. (Naruto’s lip trembles)"
Mizuki, (chuckles) Don’t make me laugh! Iruka always hated you. He was orphaned because the Nine-Tailed Fox killed his parents. And that beast is now inside you. He’d say anything to get the scroll from you.
Iruka, Naruto! (Reaches out) Naruto!!
Mizuki," (Jumps down, laughing) You know once he makes up his mind, nothing can change it. (Iruka’s hand drops. Naruto is still running) He’s going to use the scroll to take revenge on the village. (Stands up straight) You saw that look in his eye, didn’t you? Those are the eyes of a beast."
Iruka, (Pulls the Shuriken out of his back. Begins to stand) No. Naruto... (Begins to turn) Isn’t like that! (Throws the Shuriken)
Mizuki," (Dodges the Shuriken easily. It goes up into the trees) You’re a joke. As soon as I eliminate Naruto and get the scroll, I’ll be back for you. (Mizuki jumps away)"
Iruka, (Thinking) I won’t let you.
Hiruzen," This is not good. Mizuki has a big mouth. (Naruto can be seen running through the trees in the crystal ball) He made Naruto feel so bad. Worse than he’s ever felt. It could unleash the power inside of him. If Naruto keeps tampering with the scroll, the seal that locks the Fox spirit inside of him could be broken, and the beast could come out. If that happens, I fear for us all."
Iruka, Naruto! (Naruto looks at him) Everything Mizuki said was a lie. Give me the scroll. Hurry! (Iruka comes up in front of Naruto) He’s coming after you to take it away.
Iruka," (On his hands and knees) It can’t be... (Naruto takes the scroll off his back, and backs up to a tree, sliding down to the ground) How did you know, Naruto? (Iruka looks over his shoulder)"
Mizuki," (Smoke goes up around him, then disappears, revealing Mizuki.) ... That it was me, and not Iruka?"
Iruka, Because I’m Iruka.
Mizuki," (Stands up) You’re a fool. (Naruto is revealed, sitting behind a tree off to the side, holding the scroll.) Why are you protecting that freak? He’s the one who wiped out your family."
Iruka," I don’t care what you say, cause you’re not getting your hands on that scroll."
Mizuki, As if you could stop me. Don’t you get it? Naruto is just like me.
Iruka, How’s that?
Mizuki," He wants the scroll for his own power, and his own vengeance. That’s how beasts are. He’ll pour all his rage into the scroll and destroy everything."
Iruka, You’re right...
Naruto," (Gasps, shocked, then hugs the scroll.(Thinking) So it’s true. Iruka Sensei never believed in me. He thinks I’m some beast. Some kind of freak!"
Iruka," That is how beasts are. (Naruto’s eyes widen) But that’s not who Naruto is. (Naruto’s eyes are still wide) He’s nothing like that. Naruto’s one of a kind. Works hard. Puts his whole heart into it. Sure he messes up sometimes, and everyone jumps on him... But his suffering only makes him stronger. That’s what separates him from being a beast. So you’re wrong. He’s nothing like the Nine-Tailed Fox. He’s Naruto Uzumaki, of the village hidden in the leaves. (Naruto is crying)"
Mizuki," (Reaches around to his last Shuriken on his back) Hmph! You really believe that dribble? (Pulls the Shuriken off his back) Iruka, I was going to save you for later but I changed my mind. (Spins the Shuriken) You’re finished! (Mizuki runs at Iruka)"
Iruka, (Thinking) So this is it...?
Iruka, (Thinking) Naruto?
Mizuki," (Looks back at Naruto) Not bad, for a little punk."
Naruto," (Staring at Mizuki, half of his face shadowed) If you ever lay a hand on my Sensei... I’ll kill you!"
Mizuki, (Standing) Such big words. I can completely destroy you with a single move!
Naruto," (In his stance; 2 fingers crossed over his other 2 fingers, to form a “+” in front of his face) Take your best shot, fool. I’ll give it back to you a thousand fold!"
Mizuki," Let’s see you try! Show me what you can do, Nine-Tailed Fox!"
Naruto, Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Iruka," (thinking) Naruto... Those aren’t just Illusions. (Iruka sits up, smiling) They’re solid clones! He’s mastered an extremely advanced Jutsu."
Mizuki," Huh? (Stumbles around) What is this? (Mizuki falls back, and moves back) No..."
Naruto Clone, If you’re not coming...
Naruto Clone, Then we’re gonna come after you!
Naruto," Sorry. I kinda got carried away. (Drops his hand. Looks at Iruka) You okay, Iruka Sensei?"
Iruka, (Lets out a breath) Yeah... (Thinking) He’s amazing. He wants to surpass all the Hokage... And I’m starting to believe he might do it. (Lets out another breath) Naruto. Come here a minute. I’ve got something I want to give you.
Hiruzen,  There’s no longer any need to worry.
Ninja, Lord Hokage...?
Hiruzen, The scrolls safe. Naruto will be back soon.
Naruto, Sensei? How much longer?
Iruka, Okay. You can open your eyes now.
Iruka," Congratulations. You graduate. Naruto’s standing there, shocked. On his head, is Iruka’s Leaf headband) And to celebrate, I have a surprise. We’re going out for Ramen tonight."
Iruka, (Opens his eyes) Huh?
Naruto," Iruka Sensei! (Naruto jumps at him, hugging him, and Iruka falls back down)"
Iruka, (Laughing) Ah! That hurts!
Iruka," (Thinking) Naruto. This is only the beginning. The road gets tougher now that you’re a Ninja. But if I told you that, I guess it would ruin the moment. So I’ll tell you later. Over 500 bowls of Ramen."
