 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 The Weight of the Prized Artifact! 		More to the right!
 Okay! Okay!
 There it is! That’s it!
 But…
 A teacup like this a treasure, huh…?
 A delivery mission?
 No, it’s delivery protection to be exact.
 There’s a higher risk of danger than a regular delivery.
 The Beauty of Nature is a treasure of national importance so to speak.
 In monetary value, you could buy one or two mountains with its value.
 For real…?
 I’d like you to deliver it safely to Kale Avenue
 where it will be put on exhibition.
 At any rate, what’s with that humongous safe…?
 You’re late.
 Kiba…
 Lady Tsunade told me to come as pursuit personnel
 just in case something happens to the delivery item…
 Have you heard anything else?
 Nothing special other than it’s an incredible treasure…
 No Trespassing 		Hey, you with the stupid look.
 Huh?
 Can’t you see the “no trespassing” sign, huh?!
 No, we came here on a delivery mission from Lady Tsunade for that thing.
 That’s right! Here’s the paperwork.
 Huh…?
 Look out. lt’s going to fall!
 Run, Naruto!
 Hey, what’re you doing, bro?
 Hm? What’re you doing?! Stop it, quickly!
 You came on a mission, didn’t you?! Get to work, you idiots!
 H-Hey!
 Even if you die, don’t knock it over!
 All right!
 All right!
 That was close…
 S-So what should we do with this, bro?
 Die.
 You jerk…
 As for you brother, what kind of person are you?!
 We were just about to die!
 Huh?
 Ninja are supposed to risk their lives on a commissioned mission, right?
 Just a minute, buddy!
 I’m not your buddy!
 I’m your client on this mission, Shinemon.
 Come on… Get a move on if you’re not dead.
 Akamaru, Fang over Fang!
 No, I’ll pound him with my Rasengan!
 Don’t get so serious!
 Hey! What’s the deal?! Are you guys not fired up?!
 Jeez. Getting all uselessly carried away.
 You’ll get no sympathy if you get all tired later on!
 This here is not like you guys, this here!
 So you got too carried away and dropped it?
 I’m so sorry!
 Jeez… Well, we’ve got the time,
 so I guess all we can do is go down and get it.
 No… It seems we don’t have that much time.
 Huh?
 Wh-What do we do, Kiba?!
 If we took the roundabout way, we’d never make it in time!
 All right!
 All right? What’re you going to do, buddy?!
 Let’s bungee jump!
 Why me…?!
 Die like you just don’t care! I’ll pick up your bones for you!
 I did it!
 No way?!
 That was a close one.
 Idiot! Naruto, behind you, behind you!
 Huh? What?
 No way!
 That was a close one…
 Y-You…
 You got a problem? Huh?
 A Ninja expects to lose his life on a mission, right?!
 Buddy, you want to try dying once…?
 Don’t stop me, Kiba!
 I’ll pound him no matter what with my Rasengan!
 S-Stop it! Calm down, Naruto!
 I’m really sorry!
 Hey, act more natural.
 You idiot…
 I am acting natural, no matter how you look at it…!
 No way… Totally unnatural…
 Just a minute, you guys.
 Jeez…
 It seems there’s something very valuable in there…
 If you like, we could carry it for you instead.
 Now… Hand it over here.
 We’ll carry it for you with care.
 N-No…
 It’s not really anything valuable.
 I mean, how should I put it…right?
 That’s right. It’s not like that at all. Right, buddy?
 What’re you guys talking about?! lt’s extremely valuable.
 Have you forgotten that there’s a national treasure-class relic inside?!
 It’s the Beauty of Nature!
 It’s the Beauty of Nature more valuable than human life!
 Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!
 Wh-What’re you saying?!
 Hey, buddy, do you understand the situation?!
 Shut up! Situation? You gotta be kidding!
 I absolutely won’t forgive anyone who insults the Beauty of Nature!
 So… A treasure more valuable than life, huh…?
 Then you won’t have a problem with being killed, right?
 Oh, sorry… I must be going as I’ve got cram school today.
 Run!
 –Hey, hold it! –Hey, hold it!
 I’ll take care of things here. You escape with Shinemon, Kiba!
 Right! Come on!
 Others have popped up!
 What’re you doing escaping with me?!
 Do something quickly, you idiot!
 Jeez, what a jerk…!
 You go on ahead!
 Okay… Let’s go, Akamaru!
 A battle has started again, huh?
 Yes. A battle has started again.
 It’s a sad thing.
 Yes. It’s a sad thing.
 H-Hey!
 You’re late, you idiots.
 I’ll get you, no matter what!
 Akamaru, Fang Over Fang! Fang Over Fang!
 I-It’s a joke, man! A joke!
 At last we’ve nailed down the location of the treasured Beauty of Nature…
 Something coming!
 Buddy, you stay right here!
 R-Right…!
 Stop hiding and come on out!
 A smoke screen. That’s a good idea…!
 What’re you doing getting impressed, you idiot?!
 Do something, quickly!
 We know!
 Let’s go, Kiba!
 Yeah!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now, let’s tear it up, Akamaru!
 Since our vision has been sealed, we’ll just use scent!
 Let’s show them, Akamaru!
 Where are you hiding?!
 The Beauty of Nature is mine.
 Oh no!
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Then…we’ll do this! Akamaru!
 Dynamic Marking!
 Whoa! What’s this?!
 Buddy, what’s the matter?!
 S-Something’s salty!
 I’m coming!
 Naruto, where are you?!
 Get over here now, you idiot!
 You’re late, Naruto!
 You okay, buddy?
 Naruto…
 Spraying piss?! I’ll pound you guys for sure!
 Taking back the treasure comes first!
 That’s right!
 Oh man! I knew I should’ve taken charge of it!
 If we trace the scent of Akamaru’s Dynamic Marking,
 it should work out, but…
 I see, Akamaru… They’re still not far?
 All right, let’s go!
 We did it… We finally did it!
 What’re you doing?
 Shut up!
 They came to take this back! Let’s get out of here!
 You won’t get away!
 Hold it!
 Impertinent! Go!
 We’ll handle things here.
 So you go after him!
 –Right! 					–Let’s go, Kiba!
 Right!
 Hold it!
 You won’t get away, you jerk!
 It ends here! See you later!
 Let’s hurry!
 I won’t hand it over…!
 Let go!
 Boy, I was going to let you slide by with your life, but…
 Give it back…
 The Beauty of Nature… Give it back…!
 Haven’t you misunderstood something?
 You’ll let me off with my life?
 That Beauty of Nature…
 is a super first-rate treasure more precious than human life…
 The question of my life was never of a concern!
 Don’t make light of me! Got that?!
 You okay, buddy?!
 Jeez, you Genin are really useless.
 You’re all beaten up yourself, buddy!
 Y-You jerk!
 Damn it! I’ll put an end to things here at once!
 Everything’s over!
 We’ll be in a fix if we don’t hurry, Naruto!
 Let’s get a move on, brother!
 Buddy!
 Quick! Take the Beauty of Nature to a safe location.
 No way, what’re you saying?!
 You’ll get crushed if you don’t hurry.
 Wh-What’re you guys looking at?!
 Take the Beauty of Nature while you can…
 What’re you saying?!
 Hurry!
 Buddy! You okay?!
 Oh! The Beauty of Nature!
 Don’t move, buddy! Gently, hold out your hand!
 Idiot, what’re you doing?!
 Just hurry up and come this way!
 You guys are the idiots! Forget about me.
 If you’re Ninja, do something about
 the Beauty of Nature rather than my life!
 Naruto, let’s just forget about this guy!
 He should just die like a dog on his own!
 Let’s hurry and get out of here!
 Yeah, do as you like!
 The Beauty of Nature…
 Brother!
 Am I…going to die…?
 We were just about to die!
 Huh?
 Ninja are supposed to  risk their lives
 on a commissioned mission, right?
 Come on… Get a move on if you’re not dead.
 It’s the Beauty of Nature!
 It’s the Beauty of Nature, more valuable than human life!
 Hey, are you guys underestimating it?!
 I’m gonna…just like this…
 Haven’t you misunderstood something?
 You’ll let me off with my life?
 That Beauty of Nature…
 is a super first-rate treasure more precious than human life…
 The question of my life was never a concern!
 Heck no…
 I don’t want to die!
 There’s nothing in this world more valuable than life!
 Nice…bungee jump…
 Now then, what shall I do now?
 Y-Yeah…
 Sure enough… without the treasure…
 Don’t mope like that. That’s why you guys are useless.
 But there’s no point without the treasure after all!
 Huh? If there isn’t one, then I just have to make one.
 Make…? You say that like it’s easy, but….
 That’s a picture of you, buddy.
 The creator of the dauntless artifact…
 Beauty of Nature … Shinemon, the living national treasure?
 So basically…?
 That means you made the Beauty of Nature, buddy?!
 But, you’re…the client…
 You got a problem
 with the client being the creator and a living national treasure?
 But no matter how you look at it…
 This here’s not like you guys! This here!
 Well, you know…
 It means my life rather than the treasure was the correct answer.
 You do pretty good work for Genin.
 Thanks for the help.
 Now then, I guess I’ll hurry
 and make a masterpiece to exceed the Beauty of Nature!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Your mission is to take that Ninja Dropout we caught all the way to the capital.
 What’s a Ninja Dropout?
 It’s a gang of thieves consisting of Rogue Ninja,
 who don’t consider themselves Shinobi anymore.
 I can’t forgive them for using their Shinobi powers for evil.
 So, well, you can figure out the rest by now.
 In other words, there is a possibility that they will
 come to save one of their own.
 Exactly.
 You are assigned to the mission of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
 Roger!

1,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Today's…a special day, so…
 Time to eat!
 Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?
 Fight me, here!
 What're you doing, Konohamaru?
 Very good, Naruto…
 You're the man I expected you to be.
 I didn't do anything, you know…
 Let's fight fair!
 Sorry! I've got an orientation meeting to go to.
 An orientation meeting…?
 Cause… As of today, I'm a Ninja!
 Oh…
 Sakura! Shouldn't you be heading out soon?
 I was thinking of leaving now!
 Cha! How long are you planning to treat me like a child?!
 That's right… I'm not a student of the academy anymore…
 I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village, Sakura Haruno!
 I'm off!
 Morning, Sakura.
 Morning... Ino.
 Who would've thought you'd be able to graduate.
 Ancient history has nothing to do with it.
 As of today, we're both full-fledged Ninjas...
 I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!
 What the--? Why are you here?
 Today's meeting is for graduates only.
 Hey, don't you see this headband?
 As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!
 How can I put it, it really suits me.
 So Naruto…was able to graduate.
 Goal!
 I won again, Sakura!
 What're you saying…?
 The tip of my foot got in one centimeter faster!
 You must be blind.
 It's Sakura.
 Oh…
 Sakura's looking at me…
 Hey, Sakura!
 Mor... morning, Sakur--
 Get outta' the way!
 M-Morning, Sasuke…
 Mind if I sit next to you?
 Hey! I'm going to sit next to Sasuke!
 First come, first served!
 I got in the classroom sooner!
 I did!
 If that's the case, then I did!
 I was first!
 I'm sitting next to Sasuke!
 How annoying...
 Is that this year's top rookie, Sasuke Uchiha?
 Yes.
 The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?
 Yes.
 Naruto Uzumaki, eh…
 Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!
 Sakura…
 Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.
 What's so great about this guy?!
 Just beat him up, Sasuke!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 What? Really?
 Oh! Sorry!
 Wha--?
 Whoa!
 Cha! I was planning on seizing Sasuke's first kiss!
 You jerk… Naruto! I'll kill you!
 – My mouth is rotting. – Huh? Was that my fault?
 What? I feel rage…
 Naruto…
 You…
 An accident… lt was an accident
 You are annoying!
 Yikes!
 Naruto…He's at the center of trouble as usual.
 As of today, you all have become full-fledged Ninjas…
 However, you're still Genin.
 The tough part's still to come!
 From here on, you'll be in a squad of three
 and carry out your missions under your Jonin teachers.
 A squad of three?!
 I wonder who's going to be grouped with Sasuke.
 I don't know…
 Cha! I'll be the one grouped with Sasuke, naturally!
 Squads of three, eh. lt'll just slow me down…
 First will be Sakura.
 And the other person…
 can be anyone other than Sasuke!
 The groups have been determined
 so that the strength of the groups will be balanced.
 Now for the assignments!
 Now then, next is Group Seven…
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 Sakura Haruno.
 Hooray!
 I'm with…Naruto…?
 And…Sasuke Uchiha!
 Hooray!
 I'm with…Sasuke…?
 So I'll be in a different group from Naruto, huh…
 Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!
 Y-Yes…
 Kiba Inuzuka!
 Shino Aburame!
 Why is this happening…?
 Group Nine.
 Cha! Love will be victorious!
 Man…
 Why do women think that kind of guy's so great…?
 Don't you understand, Shikamaru?
 Well, I'm not a woman…
 That's why you are not popular among girls.
 I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.
 Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.  Shikamaru Nara.
 It appears we've been grouped together.
 And Choji Akimichi.
 And Fatty on top of that...
 That's all for the group division.
 Iruka Sensei!
 Why does an exceptional student like me have to be
 in the same group with this guy?!
 Sasuke has the best grades of the graduates.
 Naruto, you're at the bottom!
 Of course, this is how it is when trying to balance the strength within groups.
 Just don't get in my way, loser!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You want to fight, loser?
 Knock it off, Naruto!!
 In the afternoon, I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.
 You're dismissed until then!
 Sasuke!
 Where'd you go, Sasuke?
 I thought since we're in the same group and all, we'd eat together.
 Sakuraaaa!
 Since we're in the same group and all, let's eat together!
 Why should I have to eat with you?!
 Well... we're in the same group, so…
 You're…annoying.
 Sasuke! Where are you?
 Darn! This is no fun.
 I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura… and then it's like this…
 I wonder if something good will happen…
 That's it!
 Listen up!
 As long as we're in the same group, you will follow my instructions.
 Yeah-yeah…
 She becomes a real pain in the neck when people try to argue with to her, so…
 Let's all go out for some BBQ sometime.
 Oh, man…
 Hmm?
 Naruto…?
 Huh?
 Oh!
 Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!
 Darn! Just be quiet.
 Naruto! I won't forgive you if you hurt Sasuke!
 What happened?
 Heh! Idiot…
 So Naruto got beaten by the one he challenged…
 Of course! Naruto's no match  for Sasuke!
 No need for me to feel rushed…
 From here on out,
 I'll be in the same group as Sasuke for the long haul…
 But…
 Even if I were to use my feminine charms…
 my proportions are below average…
 All that's above average is  the width of my forehead…
 What should I do…?
 Huh? No way!
 Sasuke…is looking...
 this way!
 And with such a passionate look!
 You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 That's what its surface area is for.
 Yeah, right…
 I'm not just some kid who believes in fairy tales…
 There's no way.
 You…have a charmingly wide forehead.
 What?!
 It makes me want to kiss it.
 Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!
 Or that's what Naruto would say.
 I've got something to ask you.
 What?
 What do you think…of Naruto?
 He's quite at home interfering and enjoys it when I make mistakes.
 Naruto doesn't understand one thing about me…
 He just annoys me!
 All I want…is for you to accept me, Sasuke.…
 For me to accept you…?
 I'll do anything for the sake of that.
 I was careless!
 W-Wha--?!
 Gotcha!
 I didn't think someone who couldn't perform the Clone Jutsu properly
 could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I'm…desperate, so…
 I finally know why I…
 I like Sakura so much.
 Diarrhea at a time like this?!
 What's wrong?
 I-I'll be right back… 225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04 Sasuke's so shy!
 I guess he needs to prepare himself mentally…
 That was close!
 My stomach hurt so much that the Jutsu was about to wear off!
 Why does my stomach have to hurt at such a good time?!
 I'm annoying... huh…
 She said so again…
 And I transformed into Sasuke and had got a little closer to Sakura…
 In that case… I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke …
 and make her hate him!
 Oh Sasuke, you're such a shy bad boy!
 Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!
 H-Hey, Sasuke!
 Where's Naruto?
 Oh, there you go changing the subject again…
 Just leave Naruto alone!
 All he does is pick fights with you!
 It's because he wasn't raised right!
 You know!
 He doesn't have any parents, right?
 He always selfishly does  whatever he wants!
 My parents would get mad at me if I did something like that!
 There are no parents to nag you if it's just you alone!
 So his selfishness comes out at various times!
 The loneliness.
 Huh?
 It's something worse than getting scolded by parents and...
 W-What's gotten into you…?
 You…
 annoy me.
 Darn! It finally stopped!
 I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.
 W-What are you doing here?!
 I used the Escape Jutsu, the very basic of techniques.
 Oh...
 What were you planning to do…
 by transforming into me?!
 I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!
 I'll show you that I'm really amazing!
 I'll defeat you…
 and make you accept me!
 Prepare yourself, Sasuke!
 Just like that, my stomach again…
 B-Bathroom!
 I'm first, I say!
 I'm first, I say.
 I'm about to go in my pants, I say!
 How stupid!
 ""You annoy me"" …huh?
 I see. So this is how Naruto must've felt…
 I wonder if I can… be a bit more nice next time…
 Darn.
 Did I eat something bad?
 Naruto…
 Smile…Smile…
 Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.
 Sakura…
 Payback for earlier, huh?
 Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura…
 You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!
 I don't think so!
 Ow-ow-ow… What the heck is going on?!
 Oh…
 You idiot, Naruto!
 So, this is Naruto's room…
 And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is  also in the group you'll be in charge of.
 I wish you good luck!
 The expiration date…
 of this milk has passed quite awhile ago…
 He'll get sick if he drink this.
 It seems like that things are going to get disastrous.
 What the heck is going on?!
 What is going on?!
 This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei from yesterday.
 Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei
 who got caught in my trap and breezily came late?
 Darn it! Darn it!
 No way am I giving up!
 I'll defeat him and clear this super difficult testl!
 No way am I going back now!

2,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at? 10.01	02:16:44:04	02:16:49:17	                    Infiltration: The Set-Up!
 How is she?
 I don’t know why she suddenly collapsed…
 I see.
 The collection ships depart in the morning.
 We should get back to the inn.
 But then, what will happen to Isaribi?
 Who cares? She’s the Demon of the Ocean!
 But…
 Naruto, what in the world happened with you and that girl?
 Aw c’mon! I told you a little while ago, she saved me!
 What happened?
 Sorry, my hand slipped.
 I see.
 I’ll clean this up right away.
 Anko.
 Yes?
 The studies here, the Hokage knows about them.
 I understand.
 So, you’re saying that this girl named Isaribi saved you?
 Yeah, I owe my life to her.
 Even if that’s so, there’s no doubt that this girl named Isaribi
 was one of the people who attacked us.
 Our mission is to protect the government’s money
 and catch the Demon of the Ocean.
 That’s right, and no matter how you look at it,
 there’s no doubt that she’s the Demon of the Ocean!
 Yeah, but I think there’s some reason for all that.
 I’m going to follow her and--!
 You’re talking nonsense.
 Besides, even if we were to follow her, we've got no idea where she is.
 No, I have one.
 Really, Shino?
 It’s something I heard.
 It seems there’s one island in this country
 that played a central role in a series of spiriting away incidents.
 Where is it?!
 A deserted island where the Demon of the Ocean lives,
 Demon Island.
 Demon Island?
 Sensei, are you doing okay?
 Yes, more importantly,
 there’s something I want to tell you about the Demon of the Ocean.
 The true identity of this thing called the Demon of the Ocean
 is a human whose flesh has been altered.
 What?!
 What did you say?
 Don’t muck things up like that again.
 Yes sir.
 She's out, the monster!
 What the…?
 – Get out of here. – You're bad luck.
 Take this!
 She's the one who was spirited away.
 And why would she be the only one who came back?
 What are you talking about?
 A spiriting away that occurred ten years ago in the Land of Sea,
 but that was not the working of a demon.
 Orochimaru kidnapped humans to use as live subjects
 for his research at the time.
 Orochimaru…
 Is Orochimaru mixed up in this current matter?
 Wait a minute. Orochimaru and tests!
 Why are you suddenly saying such things?
 I have to explain it to you from when Orochimaru left the village.
 Over ten years ago,
 Orochimaru’s desire to satisfy his own inquiring mind and further his power
 was such that he gradually exceeded the scope of a Shinobi
 and in the end, got involved in developing what are called Forbidden Jutsu.
 How unfortunate.
 Naturally, this soon became known to the village.
 After Orochimaru!
 Stop that guy!
 But Orochimaru, who traveled in and out of country on missions…
 had several other private facilities outside of the Leaf Village…
 So one of those is on Demon Island?
 So, the people who disappeared?
 They were used for human experiments.
 What?
 Damn Orochimaru! What does he think people are?
 So, what are we going to do?
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? We get into their hideout!
 And we have to get lsaribi back!
 It’s settled.
 We’ll continue and hit the Demon of the Ocean’s hideout.
 Sensei, how long have you known about Demon Island?
 It’s because Orochimaru was the Jonin in charge of me.
 Huh?
 Tell me when we get close to the island.
 The pain is gradually getting stronger.
 Somebody’s coming.
 What shall we do?
 Do as you please.
 Yes.
 The arrogance… One day I’ll pay him back!
 This way.
 Hurry!
 How is it, Shino?
 No problem.
 Okay!
 So, a collection ship is on the move, huh?
 Just the right time.
 Good work, I was right to send you back to Mother Island.
 What’s wrong? You’re pale.
 When will I return to normal?
 Like you said, I’ve gathered information about the ships
 from the market and the village, even the attacks.
 So…
 What are you bringing up, Isaribi?
 You can’t possibly have forgotten your role as a prototype.
 As a converted body, your cooperation in generating data…
 That was one of the conditions of the promise.
 Don’t worry, we’ll soon be done getting data from you.
 I’ll keep the promise… as long as I don’t change my mind.
 You understand, right?
 Yes.
 Well, if you understand, go keep our guests company.
 I understand…
 You’re vicious, too.
 There’s no sign of ‘em.
 What is this?
 Birds, no fish?
 Don’t move!
 Too bad, isn’t it?
 Don’t mess with Shinobi from the Leaf Village. 134.01	02:26:06:15	02:26:07:19	You, little…!
 Well, well, aren’t these cute kitties?
 Is everyone okay?
 Yep.
 As always, you people are addicted to peace.
 You’re from last evening!
 Your face looks familiar.
 The Chunin Exams, if I remember correctly.
 That’s right…
 As I recall, Sasuke’s adversary!
 The guy who was with that Kabuto?!
 You are correct…
 Of course, I haven’t seen him since then.
 You used a strange Jutsu to suck up other’s Chakras.
 You’re the guy who sucked up all of Sasuke’s strength.
 Well, all of you, come at me. I’m different than I was then.
 Okay, I’ll finish you off right now!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Shino?
 You go ahead. Seems like I’m the opponent for him.
 Huh?
 His Jutsu is not suited for your style of close combat.
 We can’t have all three of us stay here.
 All right.
 – We’re counting on you, Shino! – Be careful!
 Wait!
 Parasitic Insects, eh?
 Found ‘im!
 Who?
 Welcome, or should I say, haven’t seen you in a while?
 It’s you, Amachi.
 I’m surprised!
 I can’t believe you’ve come back after something like that happened…
 Like what?
 You don’t remember?
 Sorry, but I have no business with you…
 Where is Orochimaru?
 Orochimaru?
 Don’t play dumb. He’s here, isn’t he?
 A Curse Mark responds even though the operator isn’t around…
 Stuff like that happens huh?
 True, Orochimaru was here…
 But that was over half a month ago.
 No way.
 It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me.
 So the pain I felt so far…
 has been the influence of Orochimaru’s presence here half a month ago?
 Wait a minute.
 Sensei!
 You two!
 Oh my, you brought Genin.
 Anko, you’re all grown up…
 Who is that?
 Amachi… a Medical Ninja who partnered with Orochimaru,
 and was running various experiments here.
 Orochimaru’s not here. This whole incident was all his doing.
 Him?!
 Hey you! How dare you run those ridiculous tests!
 Ridiculous? This is no joke, I’ve devoted my life to this research.
 What was that?!
 Look! This one has the physical ability to adapt to water.
 She combines the ability to breathe underwater
 and the muscle strength to move freely and quickly.
 It’s been a dream of mine for many years,
 to form a Ninja corps for underwater combat.
 This is the first step.
 A Ninja corps for underwater combat?
 That’s right, a military corps able to move freely underwater
 that the common person definitely could not imitate.
 When that happens, we can divide land and land
 and completely control marine shipping routes!
 Wonderful, is it not?
 With this strength, I’ll stand on top of the world.
 And I’ll make Orochimaru regret abandoning this research.
 People are not your tools!
 Oh my, you're so young,
 you don’t understand the greatness of this research…
 Well, you’re average guinea pigs who don’t know any better,
 so I don’t think I want you to understand.
 Bastard!
 That’s good, Isaribi.
 Out of the way, Isaribi!
 No!
 What’s wrong? You can’t fight by just running around in circles.
 Damn it!
 Why are you protecting that guy?
 That guy did this to you, Isaribi!
 Yeah, but…!
 But it can’t be helped.
 This is the only person who can return my body back to normal.
 He promised.
 Look.
 Isaribi…
 People are judged based solely on their appearance.
 People don’t dare come near me just from being covered in bandages……
 A monster with these scales would be out of the question.
 I want to return to my former body, I want to be a human!
 For that reason, I decided I’d do anything!
 You’re a human being even now, Isaribi!
 Huh?!
 And yet you join with those guys to attack and sink ships.
 Isn’t that far more like something a monster would do?!
 Stop it, shut up!
 I-I…
 I don’t want to hear it! Shut up, shut up!
 Stop it! Are you bullying me, too?
 No… I-I’m the same as you!
 You’re lying!
 What are you talking about? You’re a normal human.
 I want to be like you too!
 Don’t cry Isaribi… I’ll properly return you to normal.
 Watch out!
 A bulls-eye letter bomb.
 Thanks to Isaribi doing a good job of attracting your attention.
 S-Sensei…
 I’ll leave the rest to you.
 Okay.
 Let’s go, Isaribi.
 Wait!
 Don’t go, Isaribi!
 Damn it!
 We’d better take care of this right away.
 Give it up… It’s over.
 We’ll make you a guinea pig for Amachi, too.
 Insect clone?!
 We’re the same Chakra-eating colleagues, after all.
 It won’t be easy to finish a fight.
 He disappeared?
 What is he thinking?
 There you go!
 Naruto!
 I’m going to strangle you to death like this.
 What--?!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu, a success.
 All right, you did it, Ino!
 Damn it! Let me go, let me go!
 That’s dirty of you!
 What are you talking about?
 There are no such things as being too dirty or crappy for Shinobi.
 And you call yourself a Ninja?
 Shut up!
 What?
 This place is collapsing.
 They’re planning to take care of us along with the building.
 Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me!
 Hurry, the entrance is already useless.
 I thought this place would be traced soon.
 It’s an old building,
 but a damn good tomb for the likes of them.
 One person didn’t make it in time?
 Oh well, doesn’t have much of an influence on attacking a collection ship.
 Damn! Where’s the exit?!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Well, where’s the exit, Shino?!
 How should I know?
 Then, what do we do, Ino?!
 We just have to stop complaining and run!
 But I don’t see an exit at all!
 It seems the exit has collapsed.
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Are we going to be buried alive?!
 – No! – Since it's come to this…
 – I’ll use my Rasengan! – What're you doing?
 – How can you be calm?! – Oh, shut up!
 You guys step back a little!

3,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Where’s the other one?
 Hey…
 Who are you looking for?
 I’ll take care of the rest. Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my ability… specializing in assassination, of course.
 You can’t beat me by just having a good nose and nails…
 You can’t beat my ability!
 Akamaru… I’m sorry…
 Akamaru… We’ve always done things together.
 We were together whenever and wherever.
 However this one time, I’m sunk.
 My cells can swim inside your body as I wish,
 and I can even create parts that are only you.
 In other words, a little bit of a fusion condition…
 a sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
 A sharing…?
 That’s right!
 And a cruel way of killing that only I can accomplish…
 the gradual scraping off of just your cells!
 I see…
 If that’s the case…!
 If I do this… what’s gonna happen?
 Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
 Die with me…
 To Each His Own Battle
 What are you thinking?!
 It’s just as I thought… We are sharing one body, right?
 Damn it!
 Entering my opponent’s body to avoid any attacks…
 that is my Jutsu’s greatest advantage.
 There hasn’t been a single one before now
 who’s done this sort of thing.
 Are you in pain?
 All right then, let’s get comfortable now.
 Yikes, you idiot! 					Stop it!
 It’s too late!
 There’s not enough blood…
 Damn!
 Damn…
 Where’d he go?
 So he left his little dog behind and fled.
 It’s the right decision, but he’s more cold-hearted than me.
 What?!
 It couldn’t be!
 What a relief… He’s still breathing.
 What a relief!
 Akamaru… You really gave it your best.
 Because of you, I was able to hold up the enemy for a while.
 We’ve caused injuries upon the enemy too.
 It’s enough… You’ve done enough.
 His name is Akamaru.
 Huh?
 Mom… Sis…
 From today, you’ll take care of him… Okay?
 I will?
 I’m Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.
 You!
 We’ve been together forever.
 Nice catch, Akamaru!
 All right, you did well!
 Here we go!
 Be more serious about it!
 Stop being such a baby!
 Mom…
 Listen, Kiba…
 It’s not just you.
 Akamaru and you,
 the two of you need to become strong together.
 With Akamaru… Together?
 Akamaru…
 That’s right.
 Way to go Akamaru! You did it!
 Mid-air Dynamic Marking!
 Next is mid-air triple somersault! Take your aim!
 Yahoo!
 Yahoo!
 We’ll be together forever from now on too…
 I’ll protect you from now on!
 That jerk!
 Setting up a trap on me!
 I’ll kill you!
 Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Sakon!
 Blah blah blah. You’re such a nuisance, Big Brother.
 Your yelling stings my eyes…
 Big Brother!
 I’ll kill him… is what I’d like to do,
 but it’s almost time for my sleep.
 Capture those bastards alive in my place.
 When I wake up, I’ll kill them.
 All right, Sakon? Capture them alive…
 Yeah, I got it…
 But…
 The killing part, we’ll do it together.
 If I carelessly attack,
 he dodges and I end up attacking myself!
 Behold!
 Willow Dance!
 You!
 Bones?
 This is my…Kekkei Genkai.
 What’s with this guy…?
 Is he attacking with bones sticking out from all over his body?
 He’s grabbed his own bone!
 It’ll be soon…
 He’s turning the bone… into a sword!
 It’s futile. It’s not just ordinary bone.
 The highest density bone is hard as steel.
 So what?! I’ll break that bone!
 I possess Five Dances.
 You’d better not think you know my strength after just this much.
 What?!
 I’ll specially show you…
 the Camellia Dance next .
 Come!
 I’ll crush you!
 I did it!
 It’s a Substitution?!
 There!
 Damn!
 They’re getting closer and closer.
 Damn!
 This isn’t good, traces of blood!
 Damn, I did save Akamaru for the time being,
 but maybe I went too far.
 This smell… What does it mean?
 Why… Why is it that even those guys are headed to a place like this?!
 I don’t understand anymore.
 In any case, we need to leave this place quickly.
 I can’t…
 I’m starting to feel light-headed from the pain and loss of blood…
 My body won’t move at all either…
 Akamaru…
 He left just his coat…
 Huh?
 So he fled by floating down the river…
 Damn!
 Damn!
 Damn…
 This is it!
 So, I’ve cornered you, you stinking rat!
 Pretty impressive…
 You timed it well to scatter the three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since it’s a pretty complicated song…
 Well now…
 Not only did you immediately understand
 that I’m manipulating these guys with my flute,
 you understood how difficult this song is. You’re a pretty impressive punk.
 But you can’t completely understand this song.
 You're so right… since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that flute to manipulate,
 it means that song must contain individually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movement of those guys.
 I’m pretty confident when it comes to just analyzing,
 but this time it’s not looking good.
 The reason is that
 I don’t understand musical notes whatsoever.
 There’s no one that’s heard this song and lived.
 Finale, Ninth Passage, Demon Revolution!
 The melody’s changed!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 Attacks and defense without gaps using three Summoned bodies.
 I hate to admit, but she may be a pretty good Shogi player.
 Plus I don’t have much Ninja tools left…
 Man, it feels like I’m playing without rooks or bishops.
 Now then…shall I go?

 I’ve been saved.
 Oh?
 Awesome… He’s pretty darn big…
 Oh yeah…
 This is a…frog…isn’t it…?
 Oopsadaisy…
 Let’s see now…
 No tail!
 This is…!
 Not like this one.
 Or that one.
 It’s really…
 A real…
 Frog!
 He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!
 Looks like he extracted the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
 all on his own this time.
 But still, one certainly can’t say he’s stable yet…
 He overused the large Charka…
 To think that of all the frogs he summoned that one…
 I did it…
 Hey, you little brat!
 Huh?
 Huh? Huh? Huh?!
 You little brat…
 On whose head do you think you’re raising a ruckus!
 This is the top of Gamabunta, the Chief Toad’s head! You idiot!
 Quiet down…
 Oh!
 W-What the heck is this guy?!
 He seems pretty awesome, but…
 Gimme a break!
 Just when I’m breathing the air of the free world after a long time,
 some weird kid is raising a ruckus on top of my head.
 Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!
 What the heck do you think you’re doing?!
 Hmm… This doesn’t look good…
 ’Cause even I can’t handle that Gamabunta…
 Jiraiya! Hurry up and show yourself, you idiot!
 Hmmm…lt would be troublesome if that Gama found me out…
 I better get my ass out of here without any further delay.
 Hey, little brat!
 Y-Yes…?
 Where’s Jiraiya?
 Huh…? Jiraiya…?
 Who’s that…?
 I’m talking about that lecher who calls himself Toad Sage or something!
 Where’s Jiraiya? Huh?!
 S-Scary…
 If you just follow my orders,
 I wouldn’t mind making you my henchman!
 Hurry up and answer me!
 Okay! If you’re talking about the Pervy Sage,
 he’s on the cliff up there, Chief Toad.
 Up there, huh…?
 Um… Can I ask you one question?
 What is it?
 What business do you have with that Pervy Sage?
 That’s the question I want to ask that pervert!
 What the heck does he want summoning me to a place like this?!
 B-But…
 What is it?
 I’m the one who summoned you, Chief Toad..
 I fell off the cliff…
 and thought maybe you could come to my aid…
 Please…
 Hmm…?
 What does a kid like you think he’s saying out of the blue.
 There’s no way a little squirt like you could summon a guy like me.
 It’s…it’s true… I really truly summoned you…
 Believe it!
 You jerk frog!
 Huh…?
 You’ve been condescending to me
 and saying whatever you please since earlier on!
 Since I summoned you, I’m your master!
 Huh…? What was that?
 Hey, who do you think you’re talking to?!
 A little squirt like you,
 who isn’t even able to exchange cups of sake as a pledge of friendship,
 is saying to Lord Gamabunta, that you’re his master?
 I could kill you for that! Hey!
 Huh…
 Oohhh…
 It looks like he emerged on top, that Gamabunta…
 Awesome…
 I hate to tell you this, little brat,
 but even if I were to concede a hundred steps to you…
 No, concede a thousand steps to you,
 and even if it really was true that it was you who summoned me…
 If you’re the kind of guy who falls off my back that easily,
 there’s no way I could admit you as my master…
 Huh?! Huh…?!
 Now then…I’m here in the free world after a long time…
 If Jiraiya doesn’t have any business with me,
 I think I’ll kick back for a while.
 Hey! Wait!
 Why don’t you just go home and sleep or something?
 ’Cause it looks like you’re incapable of serving even as my henchman.
 Darn it!
 W-What the heck do you think you’re doing, you little brat?
 If my making you recognize that I summoned you
 depends on my not falling off your back, then…!
 Then I won’t get off your back the entire day today no matter what!
 What?!
 And by my doing that I’ll make you recognize me as your master!
 You little brat! Don’t get all carried away thinking I’ll go easy on you!
 Huh?!
 Fall!
 Chakra adhesion!
 There’s not enough Chakra!
 Listen carefully, Chief Toad!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
 I’m a man who will become Hokage in the future. Don’t forget that!
 Who cares!
 This is getting pretty interesting.
 Hey!
 Oh my gosh!
 Sorry Naruto, but I’ve gotta get back to work!
 Research…research…
 Bust off!
 Welcome!
 I'm gonna eat my fill.
 Huh... Those guys are eathing barbecue again, huh?
 A reward for having trained earnestly…maybe?
 I thought you were told not to let Gaara out of your sight…
 Don’t worry… even somebody like him…
 wouldn’t dare to do anything in broad daylight.
 More importantly, that guy Shikamaru or whatever,
 he’s the first guy you’re fighting, right?
 Shouldn’t you be formulating a battle plan?
 Humph… There’s no way I would lose to a guy of that level…
 Besides…
 You botched it, didn’t you?
 Huh?
 If you had taken the exam one year earlier,
 you would have made the Chunin easily…
 Don’t say it…
 What was that?!
 The upcoming Chunin Exam…
 I’ll have the three of you from our Sand Village take the exam…
 But the reason for doing that is not to pass the Chunin Exam!
 It is to use the opportunity of the Chunin Exam…
 to crush Leaf Village!
 But why…? Don’t we have a treaty with Leaf Village?!
 That treaty is the problem.
 Oh.
 What do you mean?
 You Genin are not aware of the detail but…
 At the time the treaty was concluded,
 that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind not only aggressively scaled down
 the arsenal of the Hidden Sand Village…
 he delegated to the Leaf Village
 matters that should have been handled by our country, and moreover,
 significantly cut our country's budget and slashed the number of Shinobi.
 When we have an idiot leader,
 we, the arms and legs of the country, suffer.
 The only choice we had left was to improve the quality
 of each and every Shinobi in order to maintain our country’s military power…
 That’s why Shinobi like you were created…
 Gaara…
 The Land of Wind’s security is in extreme danger right now!
 But the aides of that idiot feudal lord…
 don’t have a clue!
 Lord Kazekage ,
 who detected the weakening in the military strength of the Hidden Sand Village,
 joined hands with the Hidden Sound Village
 and decided to take down the Hidden Leaf Village…
 In addition to restoring Sand Village authority…
 this needs to be done in order to make that idiot feudal lord
 aware of the importance of crisis preparedness…
 If any more time passes, our Sand Village will totally lose
 its military capabilities against the Leaf Village …
 Now is the only chance …
 The success of that mission… Gaara…depends on your work…
 Yeah…
 If the strategy is carried out,
 it will certainly lead to war with the Leaf Village.
 We’ll be at war again…?
 The cost to human life in implementing the treaty was very great…
 and if it is broken…then again… many people will die…
 H-Hey…Temari…
 This is the will of Lord Kazekage.
 Of Lord Kazekage?
 After all, Shinobi are simply tools for fighting.
 The treaty did nothing more than jeopardize our very existence.
 This is a super A-rank mission.
 See it through with great care!
 Okay.
 Yes…
 A day sure is long when one’s not doing anything.
 I guess…
 Darn… What an obstinate little squirt.
 Goodness…that Naruto seems like he’s in agony…
 He must have exhausted most of his Chakra
 when he summoned Gamabunta…
 Look, look, isn’t that pretty…
 The rainbow…
 Gorgeous…
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn’t it.
 Good work, Baki.
 Lord Kazekage, I successfully moved all three pawns
 to the real battle as planned.
 The agreement with the Sound Village side has been progressing with no problem too.
 Yes, sir.
 This is…
 A decisive action plan from the Sound Village.
 You still have something you want?
 Well…
 What is it? Come out with it.
 Yes, sir…I was wondering if you could position some soldiers
 near the border on the pretext of undertaking a tactical exercise.
 With only the four of us…
 The Leaf Village isn’t idiot either.
 Their Anbu black ops are moving about.
 If we do that, they will see right through what we’re contemplating.
 But with only our current military capability…
 That’s why I sent Gaara and the others out there.
 The restoration of the authority of the Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.
 Well… Go.
 Yes, sir.
 There’s only a little more time remaining until the sun sets completely…
 and if I don’t fall off…
 I’ll be the master!
 What’s that to me?!
 You came up with this whole thing unilaterally.
 I’m not falling off, no matter what!
 That Naruto… he’s already way past his limit…
 I wouldn’t be surprised if he fell off any minute now…
 I could simply ignore what a brat like him says…
 but taking a lick really irritates me.
 I'm gonna bring this to an end once and for all...
 Hey, brat…what’s your name?
 Naruto!
 It’s Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto Uzumaki… Naruto!
 Don’t hold it against me if you die!
 Oh…
 That Gamabunta!
 Now it’s a matter of pride for him, too!
 Huh?!
 This won’t do!
 No! This is the sizzling young ladies’ entertainment spot!
 I’m not falling off when I’m so close to succeeding!
 Hey!
 Oh…
 What?!
 That Naruto…
 He’s squeezing out yet more Chakra from that condition he’s in.
 I’m falling…
 How do you like that, Gamabunta? I’m still on your back!
 It’s my victory!
 Oh no! If he falls like that he’ll die!
 Too bad for you… You almost made it.
 To think that he could hold out like that against a tough opponent like Gamabunta…
 Hm?!
 That, Jiraiya, meddling in…
 I am fully aware of the fact that…
 this guy here summoned me all on his own.
 I mean, it’s the first time since the Fourth Hokage
 that somebody climbed on my head.
 As might be expected, he must be totally drained.
 I don’t mind dispensing some of my power to him but…
 Taking him to that place would be best.
 Huh? What!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry

 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father-Son:                        The Broken Crest
 What was up… with those eyes of Big Brother’s?
 That wasn’t… just an ordinary Sharingan.
 And…quite a bit of time’s passed since then…
 but things are still kind of awkward between him and Father.
 Good morning, Father…
 Yeah, good morning.
 Sasuke… how have things been going at the Academy lately?
 It’s boring with just school classes.
 I’m always number one, so…
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 W-Wow…
 This is the fundamental Jutsu of the Uchiha.
 The Sign is as I taught you earlier.
 You build up Chakra,
 stop it once at around between the mouth and the chest area,
 and spew it out at once after that.
 Try it.
 Okay!
 Father…is teaching me Jutsu himself.
 Finally… Father has also recognized me!
 I must live up to his expectations!
 I too can…!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it won’t go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It might’ve still been too soon for you.
 A member of the Uchiha Clan is not recognized as full-fledged
 until they can use the Fire Style.
 The Uchiha crest…
 means those who possess the Uchiha that controls fire.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Today for sure!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sasuke…!
 Wait a minute.
 What is it?
 What…?
 Oh… Don’t move.
 Okay, finished!
 Mother…
 Hmm?
 No… It’s nothing.
 Okay…
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Sure enough, it won’t go like it did with Itachi, huh?
 It might’ve still been too soon for you…
 I’m just, getting started. Damn it! One more time!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Father!
 Hmm?
 One more time…
 One more time… Please join me.
 It’s still too soon for you.
 Even if I were to teach you for only after a week…
 It’s not that…
 I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu.
 So I want you to see it.
 Failure is not an option!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That’s my boy.
 You’ve done well.
 From now on, improve yourself and soar large
 so as not to bring shame to the crest on your back.
 Right!
 And…let me say one thing.
 Don’t chase after your older brother anymore.
 Mother…?
 Hmm?
 What does Father really think of Big Brother and me?
 What is it all of a sudden?
 The other day, Father said to me, “That’s my boy.”
 He’d always said that only to Big Brother.
 So I was really happy.
 I see…Good for you.
 But lately, Father and Brother haven’t been getting along, so…
 I was thinking…
 that I might just be a replacement for Big Brother.
 Your older brother’s your older brother. And you are you.
 Your father cares deeply about you both.
 Then why does he only think about Big Brother?!
 That’s not it…
 Your father has to protect the Uchiha Clan
 as a representative of the clan.
 What about it?!
 Itachi is just bigger than you and is your elder.
 He’ll naturally be entrusted
 with that much more work for the clan, right?
 Your father is the supervisor of the work, so…
 it might be that his eyes were likely to go towards your older brother.
 But, this is just between us.
 When he’s with me,
 your father does nothing but talk about you.
 He’s just always sullen and awkward, so…
 I’ll catch up to Big Brother no matter what!
 Damn it…!
 Big Brother’s back is still far out of reach.
 Forgive me, Sasuke… Maybe another time.
 Clan…Clan…
 You measure incorrectly the size of your own “vessels”
 and don’t know the depth of mine, so you grovel there.
 My “vessel” is dismayed at this foolish clan.
 I feel like…ever since that day,
 he hasn’t been the same as he was before.
 Big Brother…
 Today, when school’s finished,
 will you join me for some Shuriken Jutsu training?
 I’m busy. You should have Father teach you.
 But even I know that you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.
 You always treat me like a nuisance like that.
 Forgive me, Sasuke. Maybe next time…
 I don’t have the time to be dealing with you today.
 You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,” and poke me on the forehead.
 and you say “today,” but it never happens.
 Thank goodness… he’s the same as before.
 Big Brother…
 His eyes looking back at Father that time…
 It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan…
 And…
 Father…?
 Hmm?
 Are there several types of Sharingan?
 Oh…You’re already interested in Sharingan?
 However, it's still too soon for you.
 It’s totally different from the Fire Style Jutsu.
 But someday, I too…!
 After all… I’m your kid, so.
 Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu above the Sharingan,
 the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 Mangekyo Sharingan…
 In the long history of the Uchiha,
 it’s a legendary Visual Jutsu that only a few develop.
 And it’s said that it only opened under a particular condition.
 A particular condition…?
 Don’t chase after your older brother anymore.
 I wonder what he thinks of my relationship with Brother?
 Father…
 Why doesn’t Big Brother care about me?
 He’s a bit peculiar…
 He’s a type of person who doesn’t care for making friends with people.
 Why?
 Who knows…?
 Even I, his father, can’t read that boy.
 Here I spoke because I wanted more of Big Brother’s attention.
 Father isn’t against it.
 Here, Sasuke! Your box lunch.
 I’ll watch your Shuriken practice after you come home.
 It’s not practice, it’s training!
 I’m off!
 That’s good…
 It’s not that Father dislikes Big Brother, after all.
 Big Brother graduated from the Academy at the top of his class at age seven.
 He learned to use the Sharingan at age eight.
 And he was promoted to Chunin at age ten.
 But, I’ve got the same Uchiha blood flowing inside me as he does.
 I won’t lose to him!
 You’re not gonna tell me this is the best you can do, are you?
 You boast about your Way of Ninja and this is all you've got?
 Are you still thinking that I’m a member of your comrade game?
 If that’s the case, you're…
 a hopeless fool!
 Stop wasting time!
 Give me all you’ve got,
 you number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Just as Neji said,
 it seems Sasuke’s in the darkness right now.
 Damn it.
 He really did hit me with all his might.
 Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade or anything anymore?!
 Don’t all those things we did together in Squad Seven
 mean anything to you?!

6,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Sasuke!
 You punk!
 What’s with…this guy?
 Why…?
 Damn it…
 Is this the best you’ve got…?
 If this is all you’ve got, I still don’t need to use that…
 What?
 You haven’t realized it? I…haven’t used my Sharingan.
 Don’t mock me!
 You don’t have enough strength or desire…
 You are weak.
 Why you are weak? Because you don’t have enough…hatred.
 If I kept playing comrade with you guys…
 I wouldn’t have…been able to get…
 …this much power!
 That’s right…I need …
 Both power…and hatred… in order to catch up with him.
 Brothers:                      Distance Among the Uchiha
 Big Brother…I’ll get off.
 Don’t push it…
 Okay…
 Oh…
 What’s up?
 This is the place… where Father works, right?
 Yeah…The headquarters of the Leaf Police Force.
 I was curious about it from before,
 but why’s the Uchiha Clan crest on the Police Force mark?
 Oh… so you noticed, huh?
 Of course…
 Yeah…Let me see… To put it simply…
 it seems the previous generations of the Uchiha Clan
 set up and established the Police Force.
 So they used their own crest for the symbol mark of this organization.
 From olden times, the Uchiha Clan has always been
 in charge of protecting the public and the peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest is a testament to the proud clan.
 The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.
 But even now, nearly all members belong to this first force here.
 and contribute to maintaining peace in the village.
 Only even more exceptional Shinobi can crack down on the crimes
 committed by Shinobi, so…
 Sure enough, father’s awesome!
 Leaf Police Force 		Are you going to enter 		the Police Force, too?
 Well…I’m not sure…
 Why not?!
 When I grow up, I’m also going to enter the Police Force, so!
 Father’s also coming to tomorrow’s entrance ceremony.
 It’s the first step to my dream.
 That’s right.
 You’re late…What were you doing?
 Father…
 I have something to talk to you about. Come quickly.
 That's my boy.
 You’ve come this far just half a year after being promoted to Chunin.
 About tomorrow’s special mission…
 I’ve decided to go with you, too.
 Tomorrow?
 If you complete this mission, Itachi…
 your entrance into the Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!
 You understand, right?
 You don’t have to be so worried. More importantly…
 Umm… Father…
 Tomorrow’s my…
 Tomorrow’s mission will be a very important mission not just for you,
 but for the Uchiha Clan!
 I’m quitting tomorrow’s mission, after all.
 What’re you doing talking insanity?!
 You should know how important a day tomorrow is!
 I’m going to Sasuke’s Academy entrance ceremony tomorrow…
 The general rule is for relatives to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.
 There was the notice, right… Father?
 I get it already.
 I’ll go to the Academy…
 Your left leg…
 Be sure to ice it.
 Right…
 Big Brother… He’s so distant…
 Entrance Ceremony
 Everyone! Congratulations on your entrance!
 From here on, please work very hard towards striving for the Shinobi path.
 And I’d like you to bring further prosperity to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.
 Gee… I remember the time when Itachi entered.
 Just what I’d expect from his brother.
 Thank you for your help with both boys.
 Oh, it’s nothing like that.
 The first prodigy since the beginning of the Academy…
 There were no students as exceptional as that boy.
 That’s a bit too much praise.
 Not at all…
 I’m hopeful for you, too.
 Become a fine Shinobi like your big brother.
 Yes.
 Hey…That’s Uchiha, right?
 Yeah.
 I wonder…if he’s awesome, too.
 Hmm…Must be.
 Recess at last! What a drag. I’m still not used to this place…
 You want some too, Shikamaru?
 I mean, all of your recesses have become meal times.
 That’s my boy…
 I’ve great confidence you’ll make it great in Anbu.
 This won’t do!
 Won’t do!
 I’ve got a long way…to go…
 Really…
 You should rest your body on your days off at least.
 You don’t have to push it.
 I heard…that Big Brother graduated from the Academy in just one year.
 The times are different, then and now.
 Besides, that kid is a bit special, so…
 That’s my boy…
 Now, I’m going to hand out the report cards for the first half.
 Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy Ninjutsu: 1st in class and academy 		lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy 		Team rank: 1st in class and academy
 Do a fine job in this vein like your big brother.
 Father… I wanted you to say, “That’s my boy,” to me…
 What did you say?
 What do you mean you can’t participate in the assembly tomorrow?!
 You don’t understand your own position!
 I’m setting out on a mission tomorrow.
 What’re they doing this late at night with the lights off?
 What mission?!
 I can’t say… lt’s a top secret mission.
 Itachi…You also have the role of the pipe which connects the clan
 with the keystone of the village.
 You know that, don’t you?
 Yeah…
 Keep that well in mind! And come to tomorrow’s assembly!
 Sasuke…
 Get to bed after you’ve gone to the bathroom.
 Right…
 What’re you doing hanging around this late at night?
 Get to bed!
 Okay.
 Report Card
 Father only thinks about you, Big Brother…
 Am I loathsome to you?
 It’s okay.
 It’s logical for Shinobi to be ill-thought of by people, so…
 That's not how I feel…
 Brother's right. I really do…think ill of him…
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power, you become alienated and also arrogant.
 Even if you’re coveted and sought after at first.
 But, we only have each other for siblings.
 I will continue to exist with you as a wall you must get over…
 Even if I’m ill-thought of… That’s what a big brother is.
 Is Itachi home?!
 I have something to talk to you about. Come out!
 Why’s everyone gathered here?
 There are two people who didn’t come to yesterday’s assembly.
 Why didn’t you come?!
 He didn’t go to the assembly Father was talking about last night, after all.
 I understand that when you enter Anbu,
 you get roped into various troublesome things.
 Your father also said something like that in your defense.
 But for us, we don’t intend to treat you special.
 Understood. I shall be careful next time.
 Now I’m going to have to ask you to leave.
 Right… But before that, there’s a little more I want to ask you…
 It’s about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself into the Nakano River to kill himself.
 Threw himself?!
 The other person who didn’t come to the assembly is that Shisui.
 As I recall, you adored him like a real older brother.
 I see… I hadn’t seen him at all recently.
 That’s too bad.
 And we the Police Force have decided to launch an all-out investigation.
 Investigation?!
 This is the will Shisui wrote.
 The analysis of the handwriting has been completed.
 No mistake, he did indeed write it.
 If there are no murder leads, then what’s the investigation?
 It’d be easy for a person who can use Sharingan to copy handwriting, you see…
 The most adept Uchiha.
 The man feared as Shisui, “the Instantaneous Man.”
 He was a man who would take the lead no matter what the mission
 if it was for the sake of the clan.
 It’s tough to think that
 such a man would leave something like this and kill himself.
 You shouldn’t judge people… only on looks and speculation.
 For the time being, I leave the will with you.
 Take that and you request cooperation in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.
 Understood…
 I hope we get a lead.
 Also, we have a different route to Anbu Black Ops.
 We’ll know right away if you do something like crushing the investigation request.
 Why don’t you just come right out and say it?
 You suspect me, right?
 Yeah. That’s right, you little punk…
 Listen up, Itachi.
 Just try doing something like betraying the clan and…
 it’ll cost you!
 I told you before.
 You shouldn’t judge people… only on looks and speculation.
 It’s because you take the liberty to judge me as patient and take me lightly.
 Clan…Clan…
 You measure incorrectly the size of your own vessels
 and don’t know the depth of mine, so you grovel there…
 I’ve never seen him like this…
 Shisui…was monitoring you recently…
 Half a year after entering Anbu…
 the strangeness of your behavior couldn’t be overlooked.
 What the hell are you thinking?
 Fixated on the organization,
 fixated on the clan, fixated on the name.
 It’s a dreadful thing that constrains oneself and labels one’s own vessel.
 And it’s a foolish thing…
 that fear and hate… what one has never seen or known…
 Stop, Itachi!
 What the hell’s the matter with you?!
 Itachi… You’ve been a little strange lately.
 I’m not strange at all.
 I’m carrying out my own role… That’s it.
 Then why didn’t you come last night?
 In order to elevate myself higher…
 What’re you talking about…?
 My vessel is dismayed at this foolish clan!
 From olden times, the Uchiha Clan has all along
 been in charge protecting the peace of this village.
 The Uchiha crest is a testament to the proud clan.
 That’s my boy…
 I’ve great confidence you’ll do great in Anbu Black Ops.
 Because you're fixated on insignificant things like clans…
 you lose sight of what’s truly important.
 True change cannot be made if stuck within the restrictions of regulations,
 and constrained predictions and imagination…
 Saying such arrogant things!
 Enough! You’ll be imprisoned if you say any more foolish nonsense.
 Excellence is not easy at all.
 If you have power, you become alienated and also arrogant…
 even if you’re coveted and sought after at first…
 Why… Big Brother…?
 What do you say?!
 I can’t tolerate it anymore… Captain, order imprisonment!
 Big Brother! Stop it already!
 I’m not the one who killed Shisui.
 But I apologize for my numerous slips of the tongue.
 I’m very sorry…
 Recently, it seems he’s been up to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions
 and was a little tired…
 Captain!
 The Anbu Black Ops is a force under the direct control of Lord Hokage…
 Even we the Police Force can’t arrest him, if we don’t have an arrest warrant.
 And as for Itachi…
 I will take the responsibility and monitor him.
 Please…
 Understood…
 With this, you’ve woken up, right?
 We had a hindrance back at that time…
 But it won’t be like that this time.
 I’ll show you… the true power of Sharingan.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Give me all you've got, Naruto.
 Or is this all you've got?
 You were talking impudently about your Way of Ninja
 and this is all you've got?
 You've gotta be kidding! Right now, you're not even worth beating!

7,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 What?!
 O-Oh!
 T-That’s…
 It's the empty shell of sand!
 Lee's Hidden Strength: Forbidden Secret Jutsu!
 When did that…?!
 That’s not possible!
 While you had your eyes closed and were praying.
 What?
 For a moment, Lee stopped moving because of the pain in his body.
 At that moment…that’s when!
 Gaara!
 That's...!
 There’s no doubt about it – his eyes…
 He’s completely awake…
 The demon…inside him.
 Run away!
 That Bowl-Cut’s totally worn down…
 Gaara is toying with him.
 W-Why doesn’t Lee dodge?
 With Lee’s speed, he should easily be able to dodge that level of attack.
 It’s not that he doesn’t dodge, it’s that he can’t dodge.
 What?!
 What do you mean?
 The Lotus is a double-edged sword.
 What do you mean double-edged sword?
 Why do you think the Lotus is a forbidden technique?
 Well…
 The Lotus isn’t a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.
 It’s a Taijutsu, with that much high-speed movement.
 The load it puts on a person’s body is beyond imagination.
 So Lee’s entire body is in so much pain right now
 that even moving is out of the question.
 Isn’t that so…
 Guy?
 But that’s…!
 He has no Ninjutsu, not even one Genjutsu …
 Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,
 it’s now even less than an average person’s …
 There’s no way he can win!
 He’s had it if this goes on…
 Lee…
 Hey, get a move on all of you.
 I’ll add another 200 laps!
 Stupid! There’s no way you’ll become a Ninja.
 Yes, I will.
 There’s no way a chump who can’t even use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!
 Yes, I will!
 Whatever, but the fact that a guy like you without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu
 and with less Taijutsu than an average person
 is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.
 Do you know what you’re called here?
 Hot-Blooded!
 Hot-Blooded!
 Hot-Blooded lose-
 Hey, get in line, Lee!
 Hey Lee!
 So that’s the hot-blooded loser everyone’s talking about.
 Doesn’t he look like someone we know?
 Huh?
 In particular…his eyebrows.
 Hmm…
 Rock Lee…
 The chump who can only perform less than average Taijutsu…
 But you...
 You practiced your less than average Taijutsu …
 You practiced it over and over again like crazy…
 396…397…398…399…
 400…401…402…403…
 If I can’t do a log kick 500 times, then it’s 1,000 squats!
 413... 414...
 415... 416... 417... 418...!
 419... 420…
 So someone’s here before me…
 422… 423... 424...
 425... 426...
 I suppose I’ll come back…
 If I can’t do 1,000 squats, then it’s 2,000 punches!
 795… 796… 797… 798…
 He’s still at it…!
 2,000 punches!
 If I can’t, it’s 2,000 jump ropes!
 You recklessly practiced only Taijutsu and eventually…
 All right, you’ve all become Genin as of today,
 so I’d like to know what it is you’re all aiming for!
 Yes, yes, yes, yes!
 Tenten.
 I’d like to become a powerful Ninja like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!
 Hmm...
 And, how about you, Neji?
 I don’t want to answer…
 I…!
 I’d like to prove that I could become a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyes…
 Humph!
 You!
 What’s so funny?!
 I’m serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninja even only with Taijutsu!
 He should give up already…
 At this rate…
 He will simply die with Gaara just toying with him…
 Bushy Brows…!
 Lee…
 Not yet… Not yet!
 Lee, you just won’t learn your lesson, will you?
 There’s no way you can win…
 Unlike you, Neji is a genius.
 A genius…?
 What is a genius?!
 Even though I may not have talent, I’ll exceed genius with my efforts.
 That is my entire being!
 That is my Way of the Ninja!
 You’ll get nowhere, Lee…
 No matter how much effort you make,
 there’s no way you can take me down.
 That’s simply a fact.
 That's not true!
 That’s not…
 But you…refused to give up, not ever!
 Such meaningless actions…
 The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to have Gaara as his opponent!
 No…
 Lee’s not one to give up with this much.
 – What? 					– Huh?
 The reason is that Lee…
 The reason is that Lee…
 You…continued to make effort.
 If I can’t jump rope 1,200 times, I’ll log kick 2,000 times!
 1,116... 1,117...!
 1,118... 1,11--!
 Huh?!
 Lee!
 Are you taking a break already?
 Guy Sensei…
 What is it that you want?
 If it’s about my blunder with the recent assignment,
 I believe I’ve apologized.
 Lee… It’s true you’re different from Neji.
 You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills, and you’re not a Taijutsu genius either…
 But Lee...
 you have powers that exceed Neji…
 you’re a genius with hidden potential.
 If you’re trying to make me feel better, please stop!
 Idiot!
 I’m not trying to make you feel better or anything!
 The reason is that you are…
 a genius of effort!
 I wonder if…
 If that’s true…?
 I've…I’ve believed that to be true…
 That if I trained harder than Neji… 2 or 3 times as much…
 that I’d surely become stronger.
 But...
 I’ve recently begun to think that…
 I can’t beat a real genius.
 Is effort really rewarded…?
 I’ve wanted to know this and
 so I’ve taken on Neji, but it’s always been the same…!
 I’m no match for him at all!
 Even when I’m on a mission…
 My legs still tremble even now…
 I think that I’ll never become stronger though I strive and strive…
 I am so afraid that I can’t bear it!
 What am I to do…?
 There’s no point in making the effort if you don’t believe in yourself!
 Lee, you’re very similar to me.
 Do you mean our eyebrows?
 No, not just our eyebrows…
 I was actually a failure once too…
 You were, Sensei?
 But now, I can even win against the genius elite Kakashi,
 because of my efforts…
 “I’d like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu” you said.
 That’s your Ninja way, right?
 That’s a fine goal…
 It’s a fine goal worth sticking to!
 That’s why you should believe in your path and forge straight ahead!
 Become a man powerful enough so that I can just watch you smiling!
 Understand, Lee?!
 Yes!
 Thank you…Guy Sensei…!
 Stop, Lee!
 If you fight any more, you’ll die!
 Bushy Brows…
 What?!
 Movement has...
 ...returned to Lee!
 Sensei is smiling and watching me…
 And just because of that, I can come back stronger!
 Stronger… stronger still!
 Lee’s smiling…even though he’s been driven into corner.
 No.
 It’s his turn to do the driving.
 Huh?
 The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
 Blossoms twice…?
 Lee said that too!
 The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.
 When we meet the next time, I vow that I will be an even stronger man.
 No, Guy!
 You haven’t?!
 It’s exactly as you imagine.
 So that Genin…
 that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates in his body and use the Hidden Lotus…
 The Hidden Lotus?
 That’s right …
 This is incredible…
 Guy…
 How many of the Eight Inner Gates can that boy open now…?
 Five gates.
 What exactly is it?
 These Eight Inner Gates and that Hidden Lotus?
 The Eight Inner Gates are “Limiter Releases”
 used in preparations for reaching the Hidden Lotus.
 A “Limiter Releases”?
 That’s right …
 In the Chakra Network where chakra flows,
 there are eight places where the chakra points are concentrated
 in each area of the body from the head area down--
 the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest, Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,
 Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy, Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.
 These are called the Eight Inner Gates.
 These eight gates continually “limit”
 the amount of Chakra flowing through the body…
 However, the Lotus’s essence is to force the boundaries of these “limits” to open…
 and bring out several tens of times the body’s strength.
 The Primary Lotus…
 opens only the first gate, the Gate of Opening,
 and releases the brains restraints
 to bring forth a person’s muscles’ strength to its fullest!
 That’s the kind of technique it is.
 So…what is the Hidden Lotus?
 After forcing the stamina to increase at the second gate, the Gate of Rest…
 From the third gate, the Gate of Life, one enters the Hidden Lotus!
 No way!
 Even after using just the Primary Lotus, his body was in shambles.
 So if he uses a technique beyond that…
 That’s right.
 Huh?
 By opening all the 8 gates,
 one attains strength exceeding even the Hokage, but in return…
 one dies!
 I don’t intend to pry into what that boy means to you
 or to tell you not to bring your personal feelings into play…
 But there is a limit!
 I’ve misjudged you…Guy!
 What do you know…about that boy?!
 There is something important which
 that boy wants to prove and protect even if it costs him his life.
 I’d like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 That’s why I…
 wanted to make him a man that could protect that thing.
 That’s all there is…
 Lee!
 I’m going to teach you a new technique.
 Yippie, yeah!
 – One that will be your trump card. – Yeah, that's great!
 Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!
 Lee, listen to my explanation seriously, all right?!
 Y-Yes, Sensei!
 Let me first say that...
 this is more of a forbidden Jutsu than the Primary Lotus!
 And it will become the most special technique for you.
 Special...?
 However...
 there is one strict condition for using this technique.
 That is...
 That is…
 What?
 I don’t know what you’re planning to do…
 But this is the end for you.
 That’s true…
 In any case… it will be the end with the next.
 Neji…
 Sasuke…and…
 There is no way that I alone can lose in a place like this!
 Guy Sensei…please allow this…!
 It is now!
 The time to carry through and protect one’s own Way of the Ninja!
 The Third Gate of Life…open!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 When you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Effort is always rewarded. My belief in this has brought me this far.
 Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto…
 There’s no way that I can lose in a place like this!
 Even though this technique is my ace in the hole,
 I’ll show it especially to you!
 This is my ultimate secret Taijutsu technique!

8,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Now, let the tenth round begin.
 Do your best!
 Fatso!
 Damn it!
 Those two better watch out!
 I’ll end this match quickly and turn you into mincemeat!
 Then let's not play around...
 I’ll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.
 You bandaged cucumber roll!
 I know his Achilles heel all too well from my last battle with him.
 Those holes in his arm emit a pulsing sound, so…
 Ninja Art!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Followed by the Hidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!
 All I have to do is to prevent him from aiming at my ears!
 Human Boulder Jutsu!
 Hooray for Big-Boned!
 Good!
 Squash him, Choji!
 This guy can attack sonically without even touching the opponent…
 But that’s only when ears are showing!
 With Choji’s whole head buried, it’s like he’s wearing ear plugs.
 how does anyone make a sonic attack on a meat ball,
 let alone one that’s rolling?
 The way you are… you can barely move, can you?
 That’s where I attack!
 It’s no use, I’m wearing ear plugs.
 No, this is the end!
 Oh?!
 The human body is made up of 70% water, and water is able to transmit sound waves.
 In other words, your whole body is like one big ear.
 And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!
 Lord Orochimaru…no, Orochimaru!
 I’ll have you know that... I’m more than a mere guinea pig.
 Are you all right?
 I-I want to eat meat…
 Oh man... And the guy went easy on him, too.
 Although he lost, the least we can do for him is take him for some BBQ beef.
 It’s finally over.
 At long last, the Final Round…
 With this, the preliminaries for the third exam is completed.
 A Shadow in Darkness: Danger Approaches Sasuke
 I wonder what’s happened to Naruto?
 Let’s go outside now.
 Iruka Sensei hasn’t been alert recently, so now’s our chance.
 Hey!
 Konohamaru!
 You intend to sneak out again, do you?
 I-I need to go to the bathroom!
 Liar!
 To everyone who has advanced to the Final Round
 of the third test of the Chunin Exams,
 there’s one person who’s missing, but, congratulations.
 Sensei…
 Hmm?
 I have a question.
 About Sasuke?
 Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know much.
 But don’t worry too much.
 From here on, it’s up to Sasuke.
 Sakura, I have to step out for a moment.
 Please inquire about the details of the Final Round!
 Sure.
 Here, in our house, including Sasuke who’s not here,
 we have five Leaf,
 three Sand,
 and one Sound.
 Well, I will begin the explanation of the Final Round.
 Finally!
 The preliminary battles have ended without incident.
 It seems they’re now entering the Final Round.
 This land really has become peaceful, hasn’t it?
 This peaceful time has put this country in slumber...
 while all the other lands are busy racing to expand their military.
 Would it be possible for us to take it now?
 Humph, I suppose.
 Though, I don’t know how much fun it would be to take out that old man.
 Is that so?
 To me, it looks like you are still have a hesitation about it.
 From now on, the power of each Hidden Village will clash
 with one another in a long and violent manner.
 The Sound village is also one of them…
 You intend to be the trigger for all of that…
 And use him for a bullet.
 Our Sasuke…right?
 You guess well.
 So well that it’s a bit creepy.
 Not in the slightest.
 I still had no idea about Dosu, Zaku or Kin.
 In gathering information on Sasuke,
 I desired to learn their skills
 and carried out tactless things like deliberately subjecting myself to an attack.
 You overestimated me.
 It seems that you…
 you don’t trust me completely…yet.
 Was it necessary to tell you, my right-hand man,
 about the likes of those three?
 You see, therein lies the very proof of my trust.
 And because I do…
 I would like to leave Sasuke in your hands.
 The Curse Mark that was given to him…
 appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.
 Though, that won’t matter much.
 While there is still some darkness left in his heart…
 I want you to abduct him.
 That’s an uncharacteristically hasty request, is it not?
 There’s a little something troubling me…
 Is it Naruto Uzumaki?
 You’re quite a sharp one, aren’t you?
 Sasuke has lived for revenge against his older brother Itachi,
 and will not rest until he has achieved that aim.
 Nevertheless, in battle with me,
 he was aware that there were things beyond his power and
 faced death without fear.
 I didn’t think he’d be the type of person who would be in a hurry to die.
 According to your information,
 contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has altered Sasuke’s heart and mind.
 So much so, that he possesses some influence over Sasuke.
 The best thing to do is to get Sasuke away from him immediately…
 And quickly turn him in my color.
 Well, then…
 Kabuto…
 You...
 If you wish to stop me…
 You have no choice but to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You can’t possibly kill me…
 Though you are strong, you’re only in the same league as Kakashi.
 Just kidding…
 Now, run along.
 I trust you.
 That face…
 I wonder what could possibly be going on in his head?
 The Final Round is where each one of you
 will show off your battle skills in front of everyone.
 I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate and show off your ability
 as representative battle forces of your respective lands.
 Accordingly, the Final Round will commence one month from now.
 W-We’re not going to do it here, right now?
 This is so that there’s a suitable period of preparation.
 What do you mean?
 That is to say…
 Along with the announcement of the conclusion
 of the preliminary match to each country’s Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,
 readying the summons for Final Round requires preparation time—
 not to mention the time it takes for you examinees to prepare.
 This old man always has such a roundabout way of saying things.
 I don’t quite get what you’re trying to say.
 What do you mean?
 In other words, in order to know your adversary,
 in order to prepare yourself, time is necessary.
 Time to analyze what you learned about the adversaries in the preliminaries...
 time to take stock of your successes.
 The battles until now were like actual battles-
 it presupposed situations in which you can’t know your adversary.
 That’s for sure…
 I never dreamed that this guy could make sand into a weapon.
 However, this is not the case in the Final Round.
 Some of you might have already revealed everything in front of your rivals…
 In the spirit of fairness and equality,
 you will have a month to train yourself to further your skills.
 Now, I can’t be thinking of this
 as some sort of month-long holiday and do nothing! Believe it!
 Seriously! Seriously!
 It might not be good idea to excel too much, is it?
 We failed to stay out of Orochimaru’s watchful eye,
 and it was unfortunate for us both.
 Under this gentle exterior, a seed of evil took root –
 and it was this seed that was exploited…
 Some day, through that Ninjutsu…
 this child will as well…
 Kabuto…
 Who knows?
 Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.
 I have to give it you, Kakashi…
 Stopping my attack from your blind spot…
 But, you’d better ready at least 10 of your men next time.
 The Anbu that I prepared were taken out without difficulty…
 You’re not an ordinary Genin are you?
 You caught a whiff of me and immediately readied your weapon…
 you’re quite impressive.
 No, I’m not all that.
 What do you want with Sasuke?
 Depending on circumstances, I’ll haul you off to questioning.
 I wonder if that’s possible for the likes of you…
 Are you looking to take me on?
 You are the son of the chief of the Leaf medical corps, aren’t you?
 Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?
 Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?
 If you arrest me here now,
 you might never be able to prove my connection to Orochimaru.
 Shut up and confine your answers to my questions.
 What if I say “No”?
 I’m the one asking the questions around here.
 Now give me some answers.
 You’ll find out before long anyway if you let me go,
 so can you make an exception just this once?
 You, willful little brat…
 Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
 Don’t be so arrogant.
 The circumstances are in my favor…
 I should have known.
 A shadow clone!
 Darn…I've let him escape.
 Impressive…
 As I suspected...
 This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,
 where one temporarily animates and controls the heart of a dead body.
 Meticulously transforming even the face…
 and also stopping his heartbeats and eliminating all traces of his body odor…
 in order to prepare an escape by impersonating a murdered Anbu…
 He wasn't raised as the adopted son of the chief of the medical corps for nothing.
 If someone this good is working for Orochimaru…
 I can’t stay as I am now…
 Now that that’s done…
 I’d like to let you take your leave…
 But first, for the Final Round,
 there is one more important matter to take care of.
 Let’s get on with it, so we can get to training!
 Now, now. I want you all to calmly take one slip of paper
 from the box that Anko is holding.
 I’m going to go around in order… take only one.
 Good, everyone has taken a number.
 Then, from left to right, tell me  the number on your slip of paper.
 I’m eight.
 I’m one.
 Seven.
 Five.
 Three.
 Nine.
 Two.
 Six.
 In other words, he has number four.
 Uh-huh.
 Very well, I will tell you
 about how the Final Round tournament will work.
 Huh?
 Is that what these drawing lots were for?
 Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.
 Yes, sir.
 He’s so far away.
 Is that all the Final Round is, a tournament?
 Shoot! I have one extra round.
 Vendetta for Choji? Give me a break!
 I’m so relieved to know that I won’t be in the same section as Gaara.
 Sasuke Uchiha…
 Perfect.
 Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?
 This couldn’t be better! Believe it!
 Sasuke has to go up against him…?
 Could I ask a question?
 Go ahead.
 Does this mean that there will only be one winner of the tournament?
 That only one of us will be able to become a Chunin?
 No, on the contrary.
 The judges of the Final Round, of which I am one,
 will be made up of the Kazekage,
 the Daimyo from various countries who will assign you your missions,
 and the Shinobi Leaders.
 Through this tournament,
 these judges will be able to make a thorough evaluation,
 and come to a decision as to whether each one of you
 possesses the qualities incumbent of a Chunin.
 Even if someone loses the first round, they can still become a Chunin.
 So there’s a chance that all of us will become Chunin?
 Correct, but conversely, there’s also a chance that none of you will.
 To “advance” in the tournament,
 means maximizing chances to appeal yourselves to the judges.
 Understood, Shikamaru?
 This is all a real pain in my…
 Thank you for your patience.
 We will adjourn until next month.
 The second round will either be No Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?
 That guy is so strong he kicked Bushy Brow’s butt.
 Sand Coffin!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Now that it’s come to this, I’ve got to see Kakashi Sensei.
 Umm, where’s the room that Sasuke’s in?
 I’m sorry. Mr. Sasuke is not allowed visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey! What's up with that?!
 I’m sorry, those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital. Keep it down.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Say! Say!
 I’ve got a favor to ask!
 You don’t need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it would come to this so…
 I searched for someone to watch your training.
 Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some matters to take care of.
 I don’t have the time to trouble myself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 You’re going to train Sasuke, aren’t you!
 Well, don't say that.
 I found a sensei who’s more reliable than I am!
 Well…who is it?
 It’s me!
 Huh?
 You!
 The Closet Perve!
 Such insolence!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born

 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn! I’m not satisfied with this!
 I don't care if you’re elite tutor or whatever,
 but there’s no way I’m not going to get stronger
 if I’m to learn from the Closet Perve weaker than me!
 I have to get strong by any means necessary, no matter what!
 If you’re really a strong ninja,
 just try to convince me with your sheer strength!

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Naruto and others are out there fighting!
 We should be too!
 The Weapon Known 					as Shinobi
 Old man!
 Old Man Giichi!
 Please open up!
 Let's go to the bridge!
 If we all do it together,
 we can beat Gatô and his men this time!
 Inari…
 I made up my mind not to fight anymore.
 Even your father…
 The man we called a hero…
 He's not with us anymore.
 If we were to fight, many lives would be lost.
 I don't want lose something that's special to me anymore.
 No one wants to regret again.
 I…
 I don't want to regret again, either.
 That's why we must fight!
 A man should live his life without regrets.
 I love Mommy and Grampa.
 And you too, Old Man Giichi!
 I love all the people here!
 I finally realized…
 Nothing is accomplished if I just cry all the time!
 I finally got it!
 Inari…has grown into a fine man.
 Will you just let Inari go there by himself?
 Open up!
 Hey!
 I'm asking you to fight with me!
 Old man! Please listen to me!
 Why…
 Why won't anyone open the door to me?
 You are strong!
 Naruto…
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitious for your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage, but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service with few men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reached our Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise funds to strike back.
 And you needed to hide
 from the Tracking Unit's pursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason why
 you hired yourself out to scum like Gatô?
 Zabuza…
 Do you really believe I've managed to survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy, a technique of my own…
 to enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is… visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are trying to assassinate,
 is the symbol of courage in this land!
 The bridge he is building is the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions will sacrifice countless lives.
 That isn't how a Shinobi is supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always fought for my own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future is…death!
 Naruto…
 I want you to kill me.
 Please, make it quick.
 What are you hesitating for?
 I just don't get it!
 The only reason you are allowed to live is because you stay strong?
 There must be something other than just fighting…
 There must be some other way
 for you to make the others accept you!
 Remember when we met at the forest? Do you know what I thought?
 That you and I are much alike.
 I'm sure you can relate to me.
 I apologize for dirtying your hands with my blood.
 Is that it?
 Is there really no other way?
 No.
 If only…we had met under different circumstances,
 we could've been friends.
 Please…promise you will grasp your dream.
 He too…
 Sasuke also had dreams of his own!
 Thank you… You will become stronger.
 Hmm…
 The super thick fog has finally begun to clear.
 There are two over there!
 They are facing off each other.
 Huh?
 I can't see well…
 Which one is Kakashi Sensei…
 One moved!
 Huh?
 Forgive me, Naruto…
 I cannot die yet!
 Is this the end…?
 What was that?
 Zabuza…
 Did you say my future was death?
 You're off the mark again, Kakashi!
 No…
 You're not to go to the bridge alone!
 I went all over the town, but no one wants to come.
 I have no choice!
 But…
 Wait! 					You're just a child!
 I may be a child, but I already know what it means to fight.
 Because I'm my father's son!
 My dear…
 Wait a moment, Inari!
 Where did he go…?
 I didn't notice, but the fog is starting to lift…
 Huh? Is he over there?
 Huh?!
 What the heck is going on here?!
 Isn't that the masked boy?
 I didn't expect him to jump in to save Zabuza…
 The boy…is already dead.
 You did great, Haku.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 He intends to slash me along with the boy?!
 That was really a great find I made!
 Even in his final moment,
 he gave me such a perfect opportunity!
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leave Land of Water as of tonight.
 However, I'll return to this land someday.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that,
 what I need isn't consolation, encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need is…
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere tool that heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 Haku died and you were able to move, huh?
 I won't forgive you!
 Naruto!
 You just stay there and watch!
 This is...
 my battle!
 Naruto…
 Naruto! lt's good to see you!
 Sakura…
 Where's Sasuke?
 Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke?
 Sakura…
 Kakashi!
 You have no time to take your eyes off me!
 Why don't I go with you?
 That way, you won't be going against your Sensei's word.
 Right…
 Sasuke…
 Huh?!
 He's cold.
 This isn't Genjutsu, is it?
 Don't mind me.
 This isn't the time to hold back your emotions…
 I-I always got perfect scores at the Ninja Academy…
 Huh?
 I memorized all the hundreds of Shinobi rules.
 All the tests were a breeze.
 Until one day, this question came up…
 State Rule ♪ 25 of the Ways of the Shinobi…
 As always, I simply wrote down the answer without batting an eye.
 ""A Shinobi must never show his true feelings
 under any circumstances, no matter what…
 The mission always comes first.
 A Ninja must have the strength of character never to shed any tears…""
 Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?
 That is so unbearably painful…
 Sasuke…
 Why…? 					Why can't I keep up?
 Darn you!
 Why you…!
 You can't possibly defeat me the way you are now.
 What was that?
 You still don't know… What true strength means!
 Let's see how things are going…
 Goodbye, Demon!
 Both your arms have now been disabled.
 You can't even weave a sign.
 Huh?
 Oh! You really got it this time.
 You disappoint me, Zabuza.
 Huh?! You!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 Don't you have anything to say, Zabuza?!
 He was your comrade, right?!
 You were always, always together, weren't you?
 He really liked you, you know!
 You really don't feel anything?!

 Naruto’s certainly different from you, Sasuke.
 He’s a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
 But he’s not in the least a coward!
 Right? Isn’t that’s right?!
 Sasuke!
 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me, resent me,  hate me and…
 continue to live your ugly life.
 No...
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 No!

 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…
 His blood has begun to stir...
 I should take my time and confirm his true power.
 I have to live so I can kill my older brother…

 But it’s me who was being stupid.

 beat that man?!

 I can see!
 I can see you!
 It’s pretty good…
 You foretell my movements and your aim is sure.
 You can see my moves, can’t you?
 The sun will set soon…
 I must find him quickly!
 It will become completely dark and my disadvantage will increase.
 But why in the world right now… what’s his goal?
 Well, that’s fine…
 He came to this village. I’ll settle this here and now.
 I got you!

 Are you okay?
 Hang on.
 Paralysis?
 I didn’t expect that you could use Sharingan this much at your age.
 You are truly a member of the Uchiha clan.
 I do want you, after all.
 You’re definitely his brother.
 Your eyes hide more ability than that Itachi.
 Who in the world are you?
 My name is Orochimaru…
 If you think you want to meet me again, desperately run to the top of this test.
 – The Scroll! – Defeat the three...
 Sound Village Ninja under my control.
 You are not making sense at all!
 We don’t want to see your face ever again, got it?!
 That won’t do.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 You, what did you do to Sasuke?
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke absolutely would come look for me…
 looking for power.
 I enjoyed seeing your various powers.
 Sasuke!
 Hold on, Sasuke.
 C'mon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, c’mon!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke...
 Naruto!
 Sasuke’s... Sasuke’s...!
 Naruto!
 What?
 What should I do?
 I can feel it!
 He’s close by.
 It’s been a while...
 Anko.
 You’re level S class,
 an extremely dangerous person on the most wanted list.
 That’s why I’ll kill you here even if it costs my life.
 That is my duty as your former subordinate
 who learned it all from you. lsn’t that right, Orochimaru?!
 No, you can’t.
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 I won’t let you escape.
 I got you.
 Orochimaru,  I’m gonna borrow your left hand.
 This hand sign…
 Right… you and I are going to die here.
 Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--
 You intend to commit suicide?
 Substitution.
 As you are a Special Jonin of the village,
 you can’t be just using the forbidden Jutsu I taught you.
 I told you it wouldn’t work.
 Why have you come now?
 It’s our reunion after so long, and you’re awfully cold.
 Don’t tell me that you came to assassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, no…
 I don’t have enough subordinates for that yet…
 I’ve heard of the excellence ones of this village and thought I’d put dibs on it.
 A little while ago,
 I gave that same Curse Mark as a present.
 There’s a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 Certainly… the odds are 1 in 10 that he’ll die,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?.
 Hey...
 Are you still holding a grudge that I used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel.
 For one thing he inherited the Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features and is a vessel who can become my heir.
 If that kid lived, it will make things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three people from my village are also under your care.
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens to deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 We’ve secured food and water after spending half a day
 and now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned, this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we find other teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay.
 Scatter!
 His breathing is gradually getting regular…
 but he still has a terrible fever.
 I have to protect them both.
 I have to communicate this to Lord Hokage right away.
 Cripes! At a time like this!
 T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.
 So you are here, Anko.
 You’re pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.
 Well, don’t say that.
 Are you okay, hey?
 Huh? T-This is...!
 The Curse Mark is appearing…
 Don’t tell me…?!
 Is it Orochimaru?
 What, really?
 Now that it’s come to this, we’ll take you to Lord Hokage.
 No, take me to the tower.
 What are you saying?
 The moment Orochimaru comes to this village,
 a strict alert is issued.
 It’s more urgent than continuing the Exam.
 I know…
 Anyway, I’ll tell the whole story later, so please call for Lord Hokage.
 I found you.
 As Orochimaru ordered, we’ll wait for daybreak to do it.
 Sasuke Uchiha is our target, not the other.
 If they come in the way,  it’s okay to kill the other two, right?
 Of course.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village, Rock Lee, is here!
 Yeah, I did it! I did it, Guy Sensei!
 Now I can get Sakura's heart, right on the mark!
 You could say, in terms of numbers, the disadvantage is mine!
 But on the contrary, the conditions have been met.
 Guy Sensei, I will use that technique without hesitation.

 Water Style!
 – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 Well…I asked you to take care of them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 What business does a Rogue Ninja like you
 have in this village now?
 Kakashi Hatake…
 Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan
 What?! Why?! Why?!
 Why do I have to go on a research trip with you, Pervy Sage?
 Oh no, this isn’t just any research trip.
 There’s a woman whose data I want to collect.
 So we have to look for her first.
 I really don’t have time to accompany you on your perverted research trip!
 Because I have training!
 Hm? Training?
 I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei and learn a variety of things, like Chidori!
 Kakashi Sensei has been playing favorites lately!
 Well, I think that technique is impossible for you to learn.
 More importantly… That woman is really beautiful.
 You want to meet her, don’t you?!
 Not at all.
 I’m not some kid who can be cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!
 Anyway, no!
 Well, it can’t be helped…
 Oh, well… I know Jutsu more amazing than Chidori, but…
 It can’t be helped… Maybe I’ll take Sasuke?
 Of course I’ll go!
 I’ll pack my bags right away.
 Pervy Sage, don’t move!
 I’ll be darned… He’s really a cute kid.
 Those eyes are exactly the same as they used to be in the past.
 That being said, he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan…
 I have to assume the worst-case scenario, just in case.
 This is a surprise… No wonder you copied my Jutsu…
 So there really is a fellow besides Itachi who has that eye.
 Your name is Kakashi, the Copy Ninja, wasn’t it?
 I’m the one who was surprised.
 I saw strange men in the tea house and wondered who they were…
 There they were Itachi Uchiha and…
 the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village, Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Well, well… You know even my name. lt’s an honor.
 I see. You’re one of the “Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.”
 That huge sword is the “Shark Skin,” right?
 I heard that kid Zabuza had it out with you?
 Yeah…
 You are someone who’s well worth lopping off…
 Stop it… Kisame.
 If you were to go at it with that man, it won’t end without cost.
 And if you spend too much time, another Shinobi would come running.
 However…
 Don’t lose sight of the goal… You didn’t come here to get injured!
 Let me hear that “goal” then…?
 Just came to find something we’re looking for.
 Something you’re looking for?
 The thing you’re looking for… What is it?
 I’m different from Kisame, I won’t take time.
 Ninja Art: Water Style. Water wall!
 That’s some Jutsu speed. My eyes couldn’t follow the Sign.
 That Shuriken in the right hand was a decoy…
 to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch an attack below my foot …
 That’s what to expect from you, Kakashi.
 Your power of analytical eye…is great.
 A Shadow Clone?! His Jutsu speed is too fast!
 A water clone?!
 The Copy Ninja has done well this far with Jutsu of my village.
 Nice! Kakashi!
 Get down, Kurenai!
 This one is the Shadow Clone…
 Huh?
 Kakashi! Kurenai!
 He made the Shadow Clone body explode?!
 A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.
 Sakura’s going to start to like me…
 Maybe!
 Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke will be surprised!
 Kakashi…!
 Don’t lower your guard…
 He’s the guy who became a division chief of Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old…
 To think he’s this powerful…
 No, you haven’t seen this guy’s strength yet.
 I didn’t expect that you who are not a member of the Uchiha clan
 would have mastered the Sharingan to that extent…
 But your body isn’t the “Uchiha clan” body that goes with the eye.
 That’s right. As a result, my stamina doesn't last…
 There’s a reason why the Uchiha Clan was deemed the strongest and feared…
 I’ll demonstrate the true strength of Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!
 I-It can’t be!
 This is bad!
 Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
 Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!
 Both of you, absolutely do not open your eyes…
 It’s all over now if your eyes meet.
 Only people with Sharingan can have a go with that technique.
 Indeed with Sharingan,
 you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan to a certain extent.
 However…
 this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,
 Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm, is unbreakable.
 The only person who can bring me down is someone
 using the same Kekkei Genkai, a Sharingan user…
 Sasuke…
 I wonder how much you can take without the Kekkei Genkai?
 The one just now was…Genjutsu?
 In the world of Tsukuyomi…
 Both space and time…
 and mass… I control them all.
 For the next 72 hours…
 I’ll stab you continually with swords.
 That’s…
 In the world of Tsukuyomi…
 Both space and time…
 and mass… I control them all.
 Calm down… This is Genjutsu.
 It’s best not to be optimistic and think it’s an illusion.
 This pain is not an illusion.
 This pain is absolutely no different from reality.
 How long will your spirit sustain?
 There’s… 71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.
 Wha…?!
 S-Since then…?!
 That’s all the time that has passed?!
 What happened, Kakashi?!
 Are you saying we should keep our eyes closed still?!
 N-Not…yet…
 What happened?!
 Just as that guy finished speaking, you suddenly fell over!
 Three days in that world is less than a moment in the actual world, huh…
 But…why doesn’t he kill me?
 He could easily do so, if he wants to…
 Whoa…To take that Jutsu without causing his spirit to collapse.
 But Itachi…
 it’s also dangerous for you to overuse those eyes.
 The thing you’re looking for…
 is it Sasuke?
 No…the legacy of the Fourth Hokage…
 These guys. What the heck are they planning…?
 So, Naruto, is it…?
 It’s been a long time…
 How many years has it been since you returned to the village?
 Kakashi…
 I will keep Naruto under my care.
 It was an understandable decision of the Third Hokage
 who appointed you to the role of watching over Naruto…
 But even at your level, you may not be able to handle it properly.
 What in the world are you saying?
 I’ve been observing Orochimaru ever since he left the village…
 It was obvious that he would return to this village sooner or later.
 All told, at first I was concerned only about him, but…
 What is it?
 The guy joined an organization.
 An organization?
 What are the details of the organization?
 I don’t know much of the details,
 but it’s a small organization known as Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.
 Until recently, they weren’t making any dramatic moves
 except some cloak-and-dagger activities.
 The biggest concern is the members of that organization.
 Almost all of them are listed on the Bingo Book,
 all S-rank deviant criminals.
 That Itachi is among them.
 If the nine of them get together, their intent will not be volunteer activities.
 Since you’ve been told this much, you already know what it means.
 But recently, Orochimaru pulled out of the organization.
 And at that time,
 other members of the organization went in to action in different areas,
 in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.
 Is there proof that one of those things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?
 It’s possible.
 Because it’s one of the spirits who possess the strongest Chakra…
 Kakashi…
 Sooner or later, that Naruto will have to live watching his back…
 That’s his destiny.
 For now, you should keep your eyes on Sasuke.
 It’s necessary for you to teach him how to use his Sharingan.
 I’ll take care of Naruto for a while.
 The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto is your target?
 I know that you two aren’t the only ones on the move…
 The name of your organization is Akatsuki, right?
 Akatsuki?
 Kisame! We’ll take Kakashi. Erase the other two.
 Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 Who are you?
 The Leaf’s noble, blue fierce animal…
 Mighty Guy!
 What a sight… Shouldn’t you be called a strange beast?
 Don’t underestimate that man…
 That man is Itachi!
 You did this to Kakashi…?
 Don’t look at Itachi’s eyes, Guy! You’ll be caught up in his Jutsu!
 I know that already!
 In order to fight Kakashi, I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.
 Open your eyes, both of you!
 B-But…
 When you battle with the Sharingan,
 it’s not a problem if you don’t look at those eyes!
 You work around it by gaining insight into his movements
 by looking constantly at his feet.
 Now that you mention it, you’re probably right, but…
 You’re the only one who can do that.
 That’s true…
 There’s a knack to reading
 all of your opponents’ movements only by his feet.
 But I can’t teach it to you in this emergency.
 Just get used it right now!
 What should we do?
 Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.
 Asuma, you are my back-up!
 Okay!
 And until the reinforcements of Anbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,
 I will hang out with you guys.
 Interesting… That’s some nerve…
 Kisame… Pull the plug.
 We didn’t come to have a war.
 It’s too bad, but no more of this nonsense.
 We’re leaving.
 Too bad… I was finally feeling motivated.
 It can’t be helped.
 All right!
 Here I go!
 Y-You’re putting too much spirit into it.
 You’re not training on a mountain retreat, you know that, right?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 There's a super beautiful young lady over there!
 She just winked at us!
 Look, Naruto! She must be interested in us!
 She may be cuter than Sakura!
 – All right, Naruto! – Yeah!
 Go back, train, then go to bed.
 You always do that to me!
 Next time: ""Jiraiya: Naruto's Potential Disaster!""
 What are we gonna do about my training?!

12,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Who are you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I won’t be fooled. 					You…you…
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy… There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?
 This guy…killed my family… he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu killed your family?
 Yeah.
 Five years ago.
 I’m positive that this is the guy I saw.
 Fire…!
 Oh!
 This is horrible…
 Is anybody still inside?
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio.
 Akio!
 Memory of Flames
 Akio…
 Todoroki, I found out who attacked your family.
 Really?
 A gang of bandits called the Ninja Dropouts.
 Ninja Dropouts?
 They’re ruthless… Evil personified…
 When they rob the victims of money and valuables…
 They massacre everyone in that house.
 Why?
 So as not to leave any witnesses behind.
 The bodies of your parents were found but…
 The fire spread quickly and Akio was still small so…
 Probably nothing of him remained.
 I’m sorry, but you need to let your little brother go…
 That’s impossible.
 I can't do that.
 Damn it!
 It’s ironic, isn’t it…
 When I finally find the killer of my parents and little brother…
 My mission…forces me to escort him to the capital.
 Todoroki.
 I’m a full-fledged police officer now. I’m not a spring chicken!
 I didn’t mean to bring my personal grudges onto the job…
 This guy will eventually be sentenced to death…
 That thought has allowed me to endure.
 But, right now, right in front of my eyes…
 The same face in the flame… The face that killed my little brother!
 Your…little brother?!
 Die, Gantetsu!
 –Don’t get in my way! –Stop!
 He’s a thug who’s killed countless innocent people.
 It’s your mission to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?!
 It doesn’t matter! He killed my little brother!
 It may be true that Gantetsu is evil, but…
 You can’t do that…
 There’s nobody watching…
 That’s right, here in the middle of this forest.
 H-Hey, Todoroki?
 Nobody’s watching… There’s no way they’ll know.
 Todoroki… I said, calm down! I’m telling you, I’m watching!
 No, nobody’s watching…
 Todoroki!
 As long as you keep your mouth shut…
 No… Better yet, if you weren’t around…
 Wait a second!
 What the heck are you thinking? Calm down!
 I'm extremely calm.
 You too must…
 It can’t be helped…
 If things come to this, I guess I have no choice but to fight!
 What’s the matter?
 Why don’t you just come right out and fight?!
 You guys, too! Why don’t you stop hiding? Come out and show yourselves!
 Huh?
 Y-You guys are…
 Stop bullying Gantetsu!
 Give Gantetsu back!
 What is this?
 I have no idea… Who the heck are they?
 Everybody!
 W-Wait a minute…
 How are you connected to Gantetsu…?
 Stop that!
 Let’s get out of here!
 Calm down.
 We should be able to understand each other
 if we just try to talk things over.
 You guys aren’t Shinobi, are you?!
 It’s dangerous for amateurs to hold blades!
 Lee, what are we gonna do?
 This is a problem…
 ‘Cause if our opponents are amateurs, we can’t go all out…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Damn it! Let go of me!
 I need to avenge the deaths of my family…and my little brother!
 Calm down!
 Calm down and think about this whole thing again!
 Your…little brother?
 Don’t be stupid, Gantetsu… Don’t come over here right now!
 Gantetsu!
 What's going on?!
 Damn it, I can’t move!
 It’s futile.
 That string is stronger than steel.
 There’s no way you’ll be able to cut through it
 with human strength alone.
 Who the heck are you?
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Ninja Dropout you said?
 I, Monju will take Gantetsu.
 As long as I have him, I have no more business with you guys.
 Those nets will shrink as the temperature rises.
 So you’ll suffer till the end.
 In half an hour or so…
 It will cut you into pieces.
 Farewell!
 Todoroki!
 Gantetsu!
 Damn it… I’m not about to die in a place like this.
 Our mission is to deliver Gantetsu to the capital…
 Are you an idiot ? Take a good look at this situation!
 We’ll be goners before that happens.
 I don’t believe that those Ninja Dropouts are Gantetsu’s comrades.
 Gantetsu was telling the truth. Those guys might kill Gantetsu.
 That’s why I should have killed him with my own hands!
 But remember, that guy was calling out your name to the very end!
 So what’s up with that?!
 There must be something he wanted to tell you!
 I don’t want to hear any excuses from a thug!
 I find it hard to believe that Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 What was that?!
 I’m telling you, I’m not about to kick the bucket
 until I’ve heard what Gantetsu wanted to say!
 Stop it!
 Hey, I’m positive we can work things out if we just talk.
 Shut up!
 Wait. 					Let’s stop this.
 I just assumed you were a Ninja Dropout, because you’re a Ninja.
 We’re Shinobi from the Leaf Village.
 We were called here to be part of the police escort
 taking Gantetsu to the capital.
 Please spare Gantetsu.
 That can’t happen.
 Gantetsu saved us from the Ninja Dropouts.
 Saved you?
 Who in the world are you guys?
 We’re all kids whose families were killed by the Ninja Dropouts.
 But Gantetsu secretly rescued us
 because he wanted to save at least the children…
 What was that?!
 Gantetsu took care of all of us kids who had become orphans…
 Gantetsu.
 Is it the Ninja Dropouts again?
 I’m sorry.
 Where am I?
 So you woke up.
 Mother…? Father…?
 Where’s Mother?
 You poor thing… But we’re all in the same boat.
 You’re not alone… We’re here for you…
 We’re your new family.
 I’m leaving the Ninja Dropouts!
 I can’t stand this any longer.
 I can’t commit robberies with those guys anymore.
 But if you don’t, they’ll kill you, Gantetsu.
 I’ll steal their money.
 Huh?
 And I’ll get myself captured by the police.
 Come on…
 If I do that,
 they’ll show up in front of the prison to try to get me back.
 That’s the only way they can be captured.
 Are you saying you’re gonna be a decoy…?
 It's so that there won’t be any more victims.
 This is my only choice.
 Gantetsu really did steal their money and was captured by the police.
 We came to this forest
 because we were worried about Gantetsu’s safety.
 We were praying that the Ninja Dropouts would get caught. However…
 So Gantetsu reformed himself
 and betrayed the Ninja Dropouts, right?
 We have to do something about the real evil, the Ninja Dropouts!
 I don’t really care about the Ninja Dropouts right now.
 What’s important is that we rescue Gantetsu.
 I’m guessing that Gantetsu is with Naruto.
 Don’t worry because he won’t have been captured by the Ninja Dropouts.
 Okay, let’s believe that.
 Damn…
 If things continue like this, we’ll turn into dried fish.
 Huh?
 H-Hey… It loosens up a little when sweat soaks into it.
 What?
 Are you serious?
 Oh, you’re right.
 Yeah, I know…
 What?!
 I’m used to its venom. lt’s nothing.
 I find it hard to believe that Gantetsu’s that evil a guy.
 I’m gonna meet up with Gantetsu one more time
 and find out for myself, no matter what it takes…
 That’s right… I need to see Gantetsu again, too.
 I will then avenge the deaths of my family…and of my little brother.
 We did it!
 That was a narrow escape!
 All right… Let’s hurry up and rescue Gantetsu!
 Yeah… I will find him no matter what and I'll cut him down!
 Huh?
 –Gantetsu. 					–Huh?
 That’s definitely Gantetsu.
 Those guys are…
 I-Idiot…
 –Gantetsu! 					–Gantetsu!
 Gantetsu!
 That’s as far as you’ll go, kid.
 That guy is…
 Don’t tell me he’s a Ninja Dropout?!
 Good answer.
 I’m Monju, a Ninja Dropout.
 Give Gantetsu back!
 I’m not forgiving you for this!
 Hey, hey…
 Who are these little brats?
 Perhaps they’re inexperienced in the ways of the world, but…
 to tell me to give Gantetsu back…
 Give us back what we want. That’s our line, right?
 Who the heck are you guys?
 You Ninja Dropout jerks…
 We are avenging our families’ deaths!
 What?!
 You brats just stay quiet.
 Damn it!
 Stop! Monju! Let that kid go!
 It looks like you don’t quite comprehend the position you’re in right now, huh?!
 And moreover, what do they mean by avenge, huh, Gantetsu?!
 Stop!
 Ninja Art: Mesh Cage!
 It’s my turn!
 It doesn’t even budge.
 It’s useless… You won’t be able to tear through this net.
 Come on, Gantetsu, answer me.
 I refuse.
 Huh… I see.
 Then how about this?
 Akio!
 Stop it! I get it. I’ll talk, so please stop!
 You should have done that from the start.
 These children are the children from the homes
 that we, the Ninja Dropouts, attacked.
 I rescued them and gave them shelter.
 What? You betrayed us?
 I see… You jerk…
 You took our treasures and gave them to these guys.
 They belonged to their families in the first place.
 Don’t mess around with me… You traitor!
 Stop that!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting!
 Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you were safe!
 Of course I was!
 I’m not handing Gantetsu over to you no matter what!
 Gantetsu.
 That’s…
 It can’t be…!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Is that the Ninja Dropout’s hideout?
 Yes, Akio is probably in that mansion.
 Damn those Ninja Dropout bastards. I can never forgive them.
 How dare they interfere with the happy reunion of the siblings!
 This is outrageous.
 All right, let’s go, Bushy-Brows!
 I’m always okay to go. Even if the enemy is an ex-Shinobi…
 We’re going to beat them one and all,
 and definitely going to get Todoroki’s brother back!

13,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you there.
 Identify yourself.
 I'm not obliged to answer…
 What…?!
 Cute…
 So those are Kakashi and Guy's treasured brats…
 Well, for the time being, their applications will pass.
 Yeah...
 It appears this year's test-takers will be amusing.
 For us proctors too, eh…
 Now then! Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
 Don't pull.
 Sasuke… Sasuke Uchiha, eh.
 Does that kid concern you?
 Hmph…
 Lee, let's go.
 What're you doing?
 You guys go on ahead. I have something I want to check out.
 What's that about?
 Why should I know?
 You, with the unpleasant look. Wait a minute!
 Huh?
 – Oh! 					– Yikes!
 What is it?
 Why don't you fight with me here now?
 Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!
 A fight here now…?
 Yes.
 My name's Rock Lee.
 When asking a person their name,
 I'm supposed to give my own name first, right?
 Sasuke Uchiha…
 Hmph… So you knew?
 I want to fight with you!
 I want to test out how effective my techniques will be
 against the descendant of the clan reputed for genius Ninjas.
 Also…
 Sakura. Love.
 Noooo! Those lower eyelashes are awful!
 The hairstyle is awful, too!
 Those bushy eyebrows, just too intense!
 Everything is...!
 You're an angel!
 Noooooo!
 You are good at it. Then, how about...?
 Really... That was super close.
 You! Don't throw strange stuff!
 I was dodging for my life!
 You don't have to resent me that much.
 It's Sasuke again! Darn it! Darn it!
 To be honest, you're a naive one,
 knowing the name of Uchiha and challenging me.
 Do you want to realize what this name is , Bushy-Brow?
 I insist.
 I'm lucky...
 to be able to have a bout with the number one rookie right away.
 And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!
 Wait!
 I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
 Hey, you…!
 Big deal.
 I'll be able to take care of him in just five minutes!
 The one I want to fight isn't you… lt's Uchiha.
 All these people…
 keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke. How annoying!
 Darn it!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 As I thought, he's strong…
 I declare. You are absolutely no match for me.
 Because…
 among the Leaf Village Genin, I'm the strongest now.
 He stopped my kick…
 What's with that Chakra in his arm…?
 Interesting. I'll do it.
 Oh…
 Stop! Sasuke!
 There's less than thirty minutes until the 3:00 registration.
 Don't worry.
 It'll be over in five minutes.
 Here he comes!
 I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.
 I may end up breaking the taboo.
 I may end up using… that technique!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 I can't get completely out of the way…
 Guard!
 What…?!
 Sasuke!
 W-What's going on?
 But…he did guard himself just now, no mistake.
 He got around my guard.
 What is it?
 Is it Ninjutsu…? Or is it Genjutsu…?!
 As I thought, he's going to get up!
 Hmph… That's okay.
 If that's the case,
 this is a good opportunity to get used to THAT.
 I'll do it.
 Huh?! C-Could that be…?
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, when has he... Why is that in his eyes…
 And in both eyes…!
 Is that the Sharingan?
 Sasuke's awesome, after all!
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkai as Kakashi Sensei's…
 he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…
 It's some kind of magic either way… I'll reveal that!
 It feels like Sasuke's rapidly getting stronger.
 That's to be expected of the Uchiha clan.
 That's right… Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.
 Huh?!
 The Sharingan…!
 To not be able to discern the Jutsu with the Sharingan…
 Could it be…that his technique is…!
 That's right…
 My technique is neither Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.
 S-Sasuke!
 That's right!
 My technique is mere Taijutsu…Sasuke.
 You may not be able to believe it just like that, but…
 Punk!
 It's said that the Sharingan has the ability to spot
 all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.
 Make no mistake,
 the Sharingan reads Ninjutsu and Genjutsu that
 require the principle of building up Chakra and weaving Signs,
 and can most surely handle such Jutsu.
 However, only Taijutsu is a little bit different…
 W-What do you mean?!
 Even if you can spot my movements with the Sharingan,
 your body is not equipped with the speed to respond to my Taijutsu.
 In other words, even if you understand with your eyes,
 there's nothing you can do if your body can't keep up.
 Do you know?
 There are two types of strong people, genius-types and effort-types.
 If your Sharingan is a genius-type drawing Uchiha ability…
 I'm an effort-type who has patiently mastered only Taijutsu.
 In a manner of speaking,
 your Sharingan and my ultimate Taijutsu have the worst compatibility…
 Guard!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow…!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to do…?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 And I shall prove it with this technique.
 Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
 W-What's he going to do…?!
 It's my victory!
 Huh?!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?!
 That's…!
 That's as far as it goes! Lee!
 W-What is it…? What's going on?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke was beaten?!
 What happened while I was knocked out?!
 Are you okay?! Sasuke.
 He's agitated… To think he couldn't fall properly.
 Y-You were watching…?
 Lee! That technique just now is prohibited, you know!
 W-What's with that turtle…?
 I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…
 He's…getting scolded or something…
 Could that be…Bushy-Brow's teacher?!
 B-But, of course,
 I didn't even remotely have a mind to use the Hidden technique…
 There's no mistake!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Hey-hey.
 What…?
 That thing… It's a turtle, right…? Right?
 Isn't it obvious?!
 Say! Say! Can even a turtle become a Ninja teacher?
 I don't know!
 Fool!
 You think such subterfuge will work?!
 You should know very well what it means
 for a Shinobi to give away his technique!
 I…I know.
 To think I lost to someone so flippant…
 Have you prepared yourself?
 Y-Yes sir…
 All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!
 Man! Life treating you good, huh?
 Huh?!
 Whoaaa! An even more intense guy has appeared!
 Yo, Lee!
 Super intense. The extreme bowl cut...
 T-Those are some incredibly raging brows…
 I've never seen anything like that in my life.
 H-Hey! You guys! Don't mock Guy Sensei!
 Shut up!
 I'm at a loss for a reaction because
 of those bizarre things appearing one after another!
 What?!
 Hey, Lee! Drop it!
 Yes, sir…
 Idiot!
 Lee, you…you…
 S-Sensei…!
 L-Lee…
 Sensei…I…I…
 Enough, Lee! Don't say anything!
 Sensei!
 Lee!
 I lost to a guy like that…
 Yes…this is adolescence!
 Sensei!
 That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.
 I-Idiot! That's dangerous! Very dangerous!
 It's okay, Lee!
 Mistakes come with adolescence. Don't worry about it!
 You're so kind…Sensei!
 Now then, take a hundred laps around the Training Field toward that setting sun!
 Yes! Sensei!
 Let's go!
 Yes, sir!
 Hey, wait a minute.
 We're still in the middle of the conversation!
 What're you going to do about the Chunin Exam?!
 There's no time!
 Huh? Oh, that's right…
 Lee, you will be punished for attempting to break the prohibition on top of fighting…
 in principle, after the Chunin Exam.
 Okay!
 Five hundred howls of adolescence!
 Yes, sir!
 Idiots…
 Say! Say!
 By the way, what's with that turtle?
 If I'm not mistaken, those kids are…
 Kakashi's…
 Oh! No, he's looking this way!
 You guys…how's Kakashi Sensei?
 You know Kakashi…?
 I know him all too well.
 People call us… eternal rivals.
 Sounds like a lie!
 What're you saying?! Guy Sensei really is…
 That's fine.
 ""Action speaks louder than words"" anyway.
 Huh?!
 By the way, my record is fifty wins and forty-nine losses.
 Huh?!
 This guy…
 When did he...?
 One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi…
 N-No way…
 He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi! ls he human…?!
 How about that?! Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!
 Darn it…
 This time around, Lee caused the trouble.
 Out of consideration for my face, forgive him.
 Out of consideration for this pleasant face.
 He's better than that Kakashi…?
 Darn it! He's…
 not just all talk…
 You guys and Lee should probably go to the classroom pretty soon.
 He...!
 Then, do your best, Lee! Farewell!
 Yes, sir.
 What?!
 Sasuke…
 I have one last thing to tell you.
 I actually came here to verify my own ability.
 I lied before.
 The strongest man of the Leaf Village Genin might be on my team.
 I'm entering in order to defeat that person.
 And, you are one of my targets.
 Please prepare yourself for the Exam!
 Sasuke…
 Ha! So…
 I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?
 Naruto!
 Shut up!
 I'll knock him flat next time!
 Ha! That from someone who just got whipped.
 Hey…what's your problem?! Naruto, you!
 You saw it, didn't you? His hand…
 That Bushy-Brow probably did a heck of a lot of special training.
 Day after day…
 More than you have…
 That's all it is.
 Sasuke…
 Interesting…
 Hmph!
 It's starting to get interesting… the Chunin Exam!
 What's next?
 Yeah!
 All right!
 Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!
 Yeah!
 Whoaaaa! There are tons of people here!
 Are they all here to take the Chunin Exam?
 Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba, Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?
 So you're all here, too?
 Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!
 Open up your eyes and watch me become the Hokage!

 Sasuke…
 My, my arm!
 Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?
 Please take this medicine quickly.
 Oh, my…
 Just as I get back, I have to clean the room.
 Please make sure you to take your medicine.
 I don't need that kind of lip service.
 It's medicine that I prescribed.
 The pain should subside at least slightly.
 The pain on this arm that seems to burn…
 I never thought that it cause this much suffering.
 Sarutobi…known as Third Hokage. lt's his last curse, after all.
 Enough of the talking…
 More importantly, has that individual been found?
 Yes… She seems to be at a place called Tanzaku Town.
 Tanzaku Town…
 Is that so…?
 But the opponent is one of the Sannin, the Legendary Three Ninjas.
 It won’t be that simple.
 Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
 Here.
 It’s the same one… But this is the trick?
 You’re the type who was yelled at at the academy
 for not having concentration, right?
 That doesn’t have anything to do with me now.
 Look at this paper.
 Uh?
 I’ve seen it.
 Fine, then.
 Look at it again.
 Hmm?
 So what is this?
 It’s not something that I need to explain in length,
 but when you first looked at this blank piece of paper,
 you just glanced at the whole thing, correct?
 Probably.
 Then where do you look on this one?
 Most likely the point in the middle?
 When a human being looks at just a blank piece of paper,
 he doesn’t know where to look, so the eyes wander.
 But if you put even a single point on it,
 the mind focuses there…
 This is concentrating at a single point and as you focus your mind,
 you become spiritually stable and you are able to extract unexpected power.
 Huh?
 When you opened a hole on the rubber ball,
 you must have been concentrating desperately
 to fill up the Chakra in the palm of your hand.
 Yeah, yeah.
 When you concentrate, power emerges.
 But without a target, it is difficult to concentrate.
 That’s why we have this…
 Listen Naruto, from now on,
 when you store up the Chakra you build in your right hand,
 try to store it up by concentrating on that mark.
 Concentrate…
 All right, I’ll try it!
 Focal Point: The Mark of the Leaf
 Concentrate!
 Darn it. It’s not supposed to be like this.
 It has to break like “pang.”
 Concentrate!
 Hello… I’d like to make a little inquiry.
 Dang it.
 Concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 No good.
 Dang it. What does it mean to concentrate?!
 Damn you, Sarutobi!
 All right then…
 I’m going again to gather some information.
 What…? But you just came.
 I don’t have any time to waste.
 Hey, hey…!
 Isn’t there going to be even a little soulful game of catch
 between the master and pupil?
 You scoundrel.
 Strike!
 Here,  the game of catch is over.
 See you later.
 Humph… I’ll forget about that Pervy Sage and work hard by myself.
 That’s the only way, Naruto…
 You have to do this training alone.
 You have the ability to approach the Fourth Hokage’s level…
 Grasp it by yourself!
 Hmm… Never seen her.
 If that’s the case…
 Sorry to bother you.
 I know the person.
 As well as where she is right now.
 I’ll buy you a drink.
 There’s no need. I was able to win a tidy sum…
 Thanks to that lady.
 Yeah…you are indeed the Legendary Sitting Duck.
 She lost again, huh.
 Her losses started to pile up…
 So she was talking about changing her location.
 Where to?
 One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade, is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.
 Then this arm can finally…
 Even if it’s good medicine,
 you won’t get away with just a bitter taste with that person.
 It’s fine.
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Seven, seven, seven…
 Here it comes!
 Congratulations to the customer!
 Fever has started on machine number 44.
 Now, please keep on getting it out like a flood.
 Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen once in while.
 A 3-7 for me?
 Oh wow, lady.
 Yeah, what a great work.
 Wish I could be favored by good fortune too.
 – Oh, here it comes again! – Here it comes again!
 Yay…it’s “fever” again!
 A person like me pulls a big hit like this…
 I have a bad premonition.
 I also have some knowledge regarding Lady Tsunade…
 I did use to be part of the Medical Corps, after all.
 She was the first person to propose what is now an accepted practice
 of assigning one medical specialist to a small squad of four.
 This was a very revolutionary- idea…
 A small combat unit that doesn’t even have emergency medical skills,
 what would happen to them in a battlefield is clearer than seeing fire.
 Countless experiences in war
 simply became knowledge to equip themselves with.
 Many who were sacrificed led to the creation of that style.
 A person understands the nature of things for the first time
 after losing them.
 And the thing created by one of the legendary Sannin,
 who is known as the medical specialist
 is that sacrifice.
 Not working…
 I got to concentrate even more.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate, concentrate.
 Concentrate!
 Concentrate…
 Concentrate on one point.
 Strike!
 Strike!
 That stupid perve’s face floats up in my head
 and I can’t even concentrate.
 Oh boy…
 Some gal somewhere is talking about me again.
 Pinball Games
 Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!
 What’s the matter?
 Your winning this much is like a miracle…
 But you don’t look pleased at all.
 This town.
 Huh?
 I get a bad premonition.
 We’re going to hurry up and leave.
 But this is a tourist resort…
 We should take our time and go see the famous castle and all.
 Then we’re going to hurry up and see it so we can leave.
 But…Lady Tsunade!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 Let’s get this business over with.
 Even if we have to use a slightly rough method.
 I got to do it.
 Ouch!
 Ouch… It hurts so much, I can’t even build up my Chakra…
 He might be reaching his limit soon.
 Just a bit…just a bit more rest.
 Hey!
 You guys, we’re in class right now.
 You…fools!
 You guys have no concentration at all…!
 This is not the way to become fine Ninja.
 How can we stay still at a table, right, Akamaru?
 I’m hungry.
 Sensei, if it’s a scolding, do it quickly.
 What the--?! You, you guys…
 From now, we will have an after-school lesson
 to teach you guys more concentration!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 What’s this?
 You guys are going to do from now
 what the predecessors of the Leaf Village
 used to perform every day as a concentration method!
 It is training to build up Chakra
 by concentrating your entire energy on the leaf on your forehead.
 It’s an ancient way of learning
 how not to become distracted from anything else
 by concentrating on a single point, the leaf.
 The one who hones his concentration  is truly a great Ninja…
 This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol on the headband.
 That sounds like a lie.
 Aren’t you making that story up to force us to try harder?
 I’m not making this up! lt’s a true story.
 Anyhow, can you really become a great Ninja
 by just polishing your concentration?
 At any rate, a great Ninja is a guy who’s strong.
 Hey, you have a point.
 This stuff…
 Bye, bye Sensei!
 Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
 – We won’t wait! – We don't have time for that!
 Hey! You misfits!
 This is the same thing.
 I should have paid more attention to what Iruka Sensei was saying…
 I’m so stupid.
 But nothing will start if I just keep on regretting.
 All right, I’m going to master this!
 Concentrate, concentrate…
 Concentrate!
 Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have a commanding presence!
 It’s worth being designated as the cultural heritage.
 Don’t dally…
 We’re going to hurry up and leave this town.
 Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully…
 It costs nothing to view.
 Lady Tsunade?
 What is this chill?
 Now!
 What a kid…
 Raising the density in Chakra to the point that it burns the palm.
 He never ceases to amaze me.
 It broke.
 Good! The second step seems  to be complete.
 Hurry… The third step.
 That will come later.
 We’ll now go meet Tsunade.
 That’s…
 Orochimaru.
 I found you.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 I can master the third step while walking? Give me a break!
 Fool! If we don't hurry it up, we'll lose Tsunade!
 Besides, she's short-tempered and impatient!
 Where are we heading?
 If she's here in this town, we'll just look for her from somewhere high up.
 – So we'll climb up a castle. – Castle?!
 – Can't you see over there?! – Which way is ""over there""?
 I'm saying…
 Oh! What the--?!

 Right now, this is all I can do. I can’t allow myself to fail!
 What’s up?
 Going to all the trouble of coming to pick me up like this…
 You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s after this anyway, right…?
 Taking the time to converse once in a while…
 that’s also part of teamwork.
 Let me hear about your mission.
 It was pretty incredible…
 But you wouldn’t understand even if I explained it to you.
 I don’t want Akamaru to experience that kind of thing ever again.
 And for that reason, I must polish my Jutsu all the more…
 I want to hear about it in detail.
 Because that’s what teamwork is about.
 Are you sulking
 ‘cause you were the only one who was passed up?
 You are sulking, aren’t you?
 There have to be more further up…

 Maintaining the prime of one’s youth is starting to get tough…
 Thank you very much!
 Do your best, guys…
 I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by the next time you’re here!
 M-Me too…
 I want to become a Kunoichi just like you, Temari…
 I’m honored.
 I apologize for asking you to teach at the Academy…
 since we’re so short-staffed right now.
 You probably would've preferred to go sightseeing or something.
 No problem. I’m doing this because I enjoy it.
 Yeah… And we were also able to survey
 the future potential of the Leaf’s military power…
 Well, be careful going home.
 Okay…

 There he is!
 But my training…
 Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.
 Some work came in all of a sudden. lt can’t be helped.
 It’s just gonna be doing an interview
 for some obscene magazine anyway, right?
 That kind of thing isn’t called work.
 It’s a mission to gather information about the Akatsuki Organization.
 But if I tell this guy that,
 he might ask me to let him come.

 Since I have been entrusted
 with the great Village Hidden in the Leaves that you built,
 no matter what danger might strike, it is my duty to protect it.
 The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
 Yes, you really do.
 Is that you, Shizune? Enter!
 All of these reports regarding the village’s internal affairs accumulated
 because so many things were happening in the Leaf Village.
 I guess the only thing to do is start at the top.
 Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
 Did its name change?
 Yes, in the past it was called
 Prison Specializing in Capital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because there is a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility, the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved in leaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal Ninja…
 There haven’t been any noticeable disruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has been relatively stable.
 – Food! 					– Food!
 It’s finally time to eat, isn’t it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! I’m so excited!

 You may pass!
 Hey! Wait!
 You’re hurt, aren’t you?
 Go to the dispensary later and have that looked at.
 Okay…
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder Brother…
 Huh?
 Why is the little finger short and weak?
 That’s easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb would have no leg to stand on.
 I-I see!
 Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
 – Huh? 					– A lizard!
 Raijin, you’ve always been a dandy one from way back.
 W-We haven’t had enough to eat, have we, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Not asking permission again…
 What’s the matter?
 What’s up this time?
 I’m starving…
 G-Give us something to eat!
 Oh no… If these guys find out I don’t have anything…!
 Um…right now…
 Don’t tell me that you don’t have even one offering…
 to these Fujin and Raijin brothers?!
 Well…wait…wait…!
 What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
 I’ll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quiet when they have food.
 But if they get angry they’re out of control.
 Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades over food during a mission
 and the people around just barely managed to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 – Food! Food! Food! – Food! Food! Food!
 I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
 There’s still a whole lot more to do, Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formula for some kind of medicine…
 A formula…
 Send an available Jonin here immediately!
 Yes, ma’am?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, ma’am!
 How about it… Does it taste good?
 I see…I see… There’s still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was coming from your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother always has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
 ’Cause I’d feel so sorry if you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder Brother…
 – A lizard! 					– A lizard!
 I see, I see…Happy?
 How about it, you guys?
 Don’t you want to eat things that are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place where an old friend of mine is…
 you can pig out on food that’s even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told us about long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
 Gimme a break… that guy’s gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy Sage…
 just leaving me and my training up in the air!
 Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 It’s probably that Lady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiya could do the job…
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s doing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat you to some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 I’m gonna go complain to Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 Damn… another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff member used Naruto
 to sneak out the Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it was a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, but…?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen that a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clue…
 This is something that Mizuki was concealing
 when he was incarcerated in the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of it as anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I don’t know, however…
 The handwriting resembles the document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conducting human experiments…
 Which means that… Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 It’s not like a Chunin alone could do anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaru were pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the Maximum Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! Something’s strange here!
 Yeah… It’s too quiet.
 Let’s go!
 Oh, how touching. A welome party for us…
 Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome. Right, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Asuma, don’t tell me that those guys are…
 Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
 Fujin and Raijin!
 Asuma…
 Hey, you guys are whooping it up too much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm down… the welcome party’s just started.
 His character has changed completely…
 All you jerks…
 You will…be our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
 What in the world happened?
 Say, weren't you together with Shizune?
 Don't tell me something's happened to her?
 I don't know what happened, but take me there, Ton Ton!
 I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

16,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Hmm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 ""This man who calls himself Tokichi is a major criminal
 who has killed a family of three…""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmark on his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmark…? lt couldn’t be…
 What is it, Hinata?
 I can’t tell because his face is covered with scars.
 But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
 He has a bounty on his head too?
 What the heck is going on with everything?
 Hunt or Be Hunted?!                      Showdown at the OK Temple
 Where are you going, old man?
 Just rest quietly.
 Let go!
 Stay out of my way! Gosunkugi is mine…
 What the heck can you do in that condition, you wanted man?!
 A bounty hunter who was in the bar attacked last night…
 What’s the idea of a bounty chasing after a bounty?
 It’s none of your concern!
 Your wound again…
 Stop!
 D-Don’t move!
 I didn’t do it…
 Then, how do you explain this wanted flyer?
 That Gosunkugi did it…
 He killed an innocent family of three…
 just to steal money.
 What do you mean by that?
 I was a swordsmith in a tiny village…
 in a small country sandwiched between two large countries.
 I was poor, but for me it was a happy life.
 But on that festival day…
 I was about to go deliver a sword that a customer had ordered.
 I wanted to participate in the festival right away, so I was hurrying.
 At that very moment…
 For some reason, the door was half open.
 It’s Tokichi… I’m delivering the sword you ordered…
 I told everyone everything as it happened.
 But…the people in the village wouldn’t believe me.
 It’s because I was the only one who hadn’t shown up at the festival.
 And the particular shape of the sword that stabbed through the family…
 A swordsmith should be able to make any kind of weapon…
 That was the reason.
 Stand up, Tokichi!
 Tokichi!
 Don’t let him get away! After him!
 And ever since…
 I wandered aimlessly from town to town.
 BOUNTY  One million ryo
 It was something the villagers had issued.
 And there was one more wanted flyer besides mine…
 BOUNTY 					Threee million yen
 …of the man who killed the family.
 I resolved to capture Gosunkugi with my own hands.
 I would clear my name and return to my village…
 And…to get some information about him, if even just a little…
 I became a bounty hunter despite having a price on my own head.
 So that’s why we were in the way, huh?
 The only way to prove my innocence is for me to capture him myself.
 I want to go home.
 Will you…concede him to me?
 We’re Ninja.
 We carry out missions we’ve received, no matter what!
 Even if the worst were to happen, we can’t let him get away.
 Let’s go…
 Was that okay, Naruto?
 That Gosunkugi jerk!
 We have to capture him, no matter what.
 That’s right.
 And if that old man, Sazanami, pushes it too far in his condition,
 not only will he fail in capturing Gosunkugi, he could end up getting killed instead.
 Don’t hold back. I’ll give you…
 the likes of my head.
 You’re wounded, so I can kill you whenever I want.
 Before that, I’ll be taking Gosunkugi.
 Well, I guess I’ll just have those Shinobi kids do their best.
 The Land of Stone, Post Station Two…
 It seems everything in this town…
 politics, economics, military, is conducted by monks.
 It really is. Nothing but temples…
 The temple, which could be called the head temple,
 is the OK Temple on that mountain.
 Hey, Hinata. What’s that bell?
 That was created as the sightseeing crown jewel
 to recruit people to live in their temple… The Golden Bell!
 It’s just like it is saying, “Please steal me.”
 I know… Gosunkugi is after that bell!
 – Yeah. 					– Yeah.
 But how does that Gosunkugi guy intend to steal that bell?
 Naruto!
 Huh…?
 You guys…are Gosunkugi’s…!
 Are these guys going to corral us?!
 Just like the time with Sazanami…
 Byakugan.
 Look out! Run!
 Old Man Sazanami?!
 Leave this to me!
 All right!
 Eat this!
 What’re you doing here…?
 I just came to settle the score.
 But…your wound is still…
 I won’t get in your way.
 I’ll pursue the target on my own. This is a competition!
 I guess it can’t be helped. I accept!
 But we can’t even start as things stand now!
 There are still nails in the ground…
 He’s waiting for the best moment.
 Gosunkugi!
 The bell…is at the top!
 What…?! Could it be…?!
 Oh, no…!
 The nails in the ground aren’t moving.
 The Jutsu has worn off!
 What?!
 Damn it! When did he--?!
 So as the words say, we’ve been “nailed down,” huh?
 They're by the bell!
 Why that--!
 Wait! Don’t forget the bounty hunter from last night is also after Gosunkugi!
 No problem…! We’ll get there first, no matter what!
 Let’s go!
 How awful…
 That Gosunkugi jerk…!
 Unforgivable!
 Hey! Where’s Gosunkugi?!
 Naruto! He’ll get away if we’re too slow!

 If I kill you, the one who can prove my innocence will be gone!
 We lose…
 That’s right…
 What?!
 Bounty Sazanami, otherwise known as Tokichi…
 I, Gatsu, have apprehended you!
 And you, bounty Gosunkugi!
 Your spree of evil deeds…
 The number of charges against you is incalculable…
 A government official has ordered you hauled in for questioning!
 Old man…
 Damn it. There’s nothing we can do if the opposition is a bureaucrat…
 You murderer!
 Give back the family you killed!
 We’ll kill you in the same way!
 Damn it…!
 Hey, hey, you guys!
 You’ve got nerve to put up wanted flyers without doing a decent investigation!
 This man is the true culprit behind the murder that occurred in this village!
 This Gosunkugi has already been apprehended and has confessed.
 And the weapon has been seized…
 Therefore this individual Tokichi shall be acquitted!
 You jerks! You made me work for free!
 What’re you going to do about it?!
 Why’d you do that for me?
 I overheard some stupid tale of woe, you see.
 It makes no difference to a bounty hunter…
 But I overheard it, and so I had no choice.
 It was necessary to verify whether or not you really are a wanted man…
 You…
 Not “you.” Gatsu!
 I’m also a bounty hunter… I’m in the same trade as you!
 Gatsu…
 Tokichi… We’re sorry.
 Forgive us, Tokichi.
 Good for you… Old Man Sazanami.
 Let’s go.
 I’ve kind of gotten homesick and really miss the Leaf Village…
 But you know, a failed mission means failure…
 The Fifth Hokage’s going to scold you good, Naruto.
 What?!
 You failed another mission?!
 I…don’t want to go home…
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?

 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 Umm, where’s the room that Sasuke’s in?
 Mr. Sasuke is not allowed any visitors.
 What?! Hey, hey! What's up with that?!
 I’m sorry, those are the rules.
 Why, Sis, tell me why?
 Naruto, this is a hospital. Keep it down.
 Say! Say! I've got a favor to ask!
 You don’t need to say it all.
 Well, I thought it would come to this so…
 I searched for someone to watch your training.
 Why?!
 I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
 I have some matters to take care of.
 I don’t have time to trouble myself with you.
 Oh! Aha...!
 You’re going to train Sasuke, aren’t you?!
 Well... don't say that.
 I found a sensei who’s more reliable than I am!
 Well…who is it?
 It’s me!
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 You!
 The Closet Perv!
 Such insolence!
 Ebisu Returns: Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!
 Ebisu Sensei is a Closet Perv?
 Why’s this guy my training teacher?!
 In the first place, he’s weaker than me!
 What did you say?
 But you see! But you see!
 A long time ago, with my Harem Jutsu, this guy…
 Transform!
 Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!
 B-By any chance…
 Harem Jutsu?
 U-Uh…it’s nothing!
 I’ll treat you to and buy you whatever you want later!
 Just be quiet about that!
 You better.
 Wow, I didn’t know you were acquainted.
 Well, they’re unsavory ties, but.
 How could I ever forget that humiliation?
 But why this guy?
 I definitely don’t want him to.
 Same here.
 If it weren’t Kakashi’s favor, who’d teach you for the fun of it?
 Then don’t.
 Now now, both of you…
 Don’t say that.
 Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
 who teaches the elite, a special Jonin!
 He’s truly better at teaching than I am.
 Well, Naruto, of the three kids in Squad Seven that I taught,
 you’re the worst at the basic skills.
 Get taught with care this time around.
 How the heck am I inferior compared to Sakura and Sasuke?!
 Naruto, it’s fact that you don’t have the fundamentals down.
 No matter what you do, the basic skills are important.
 If you really want to become strong, just be quiet and listen to what I say.
 Now then, Ebisu Sensei, I’m leaving him with you.
 Yes, yes.
 Dang it.
 It may appear to be harsh,
 but you can become stronger a lot more.
 Do your best.
 Okay, then, let’s go.
 Still, I’m not convinced…
 Huh?
 You see!
 Fundamentals might be important,
 but I won’t get strong being taught by someone weaker than me!
 So in other words, you want to say that I’m weak?
 Who else is here?!
 I was certainly surprised having that indecent Jutsu used on me that time.
 But it’s premature for you to judge my ability on just that.
 Even though you were totally knocked out.
 Fine.
 Then, why don’t we put it to the test?
 Hmm?
 Naruto, run.
 Huh?
 If you can get to outrun me, I’ll back down quietly.
 Back down…?
 Yes.
 And of course, I’ll speak to Kakashi Sensei
 about you receiving direct training.
 What?! Really?!
 This elite instructor does not go back on his word.
 However, this is only if you can outrun me.
 Then that makes it easy!
 See ya!
 This’ll be a snap, a snap!
 I’ll lose that… Closet Perv in no time!
 He already can’t catch up!
 I knew I was quite an exceptional Ninja…
 Who is exceptional, you say?
 Surely you’re not thinking you can outrun me with just that much.
 W-What’re you saying?!
 The chase has still…
 only just begun!
 Though he’s a Closet Perv,
 he’s the elite tutor after all, he’s good.
 Now then.
 I knew you were Closet Perv.
 What are you doing…?
 Naruto?
 I see. The idea isn’t bad.
 Then, how about this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Heh!
 Catch me…if you can!
 Not bad…
 However, you are not the only one who uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I won’t let you get away!
 Dang it!
 Son…of…a...!
 Now then, next.
 Hold it!
 I found you!
 Wait!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Get off!
 There! No, actually, here!
 Here!
 There!
 There!
 Hold it!
 Have you reached your limit?
 You’re freaking pesky!
 Give it up already!
 What are you snapping back at me for?
 This is a chase, so chasing is natural, right?
 T-True enough…
 Naruto, you have understood my greatness by now, right?
 It’s about time you surrendered and moved on to training--
 The heck with that!
 I’m going to bump you off, and receive Kakashi Sensei’s training!
 Even if I have to knock you out!
 It appears you still have some spirit left.
 To think he would come at me head on, even though this is a chase.
 Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.
 As Kakashi said, he’s the number one unpredictability Ninja.
 Don’t take this badly!
 Eat this!
 Clone Jutsu…?
 The game is over, Naruto!
 Dang it!
 Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles and salt-flavor ramen noodles!
 Here you go!
 Naruto, having been shown your movements and
 having further analyzed what Kakashi has told me…
 it is clear that you cannot control Chakra well.
 Control…?
 That’s right.
 Now then, comparing you with Sasuke and Sakura …
 I shall explain your bad points in order.
 As you know, in the case of using Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,
 Ninjas build up Chakra and activate the Jutsu.
 I-I know that already!
 Is that so?
 Then, in the case of comparing the three of you,
 I shall explain specifically how you are inferior.
 That’s kind of an irritating way of saying it.
 I’m treating you the ramen as promised,
 so be quiet and listen!
 First, let us say that Sakura uses Clone Jutsu.
 Clone Jutsu!
 In her case, her build-up control as well as her control of Chakra is perfect,
 so she can make clones without using wasteful energy.
 Cha!
 Next, in Sasuke’s case,
 he is somewhat poor at building up Chakra.
 Clone Jutsu.
 But, his control of Chakra is perfect,
 so both he and Sakura can make five clones.
 But, he uses a bit more wasteful Chakra than Sakura.
 Oh!
 So Sasuke’s nothing special.
 In your case, there’s no time to be laughing at others.
 Huh?
 You are very poor at building up Chakra and controlling it,
 so you cannot make clones with the same amount of Chakra.
 In the case where you strain to make clones despite that,
 after consuming a much larger amount of Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke…
 Clone Jutsu!
 ...you can barely make one clone at best.
 By the way,
 Sakura and Sasuke can become ten with the same amount of Chakra.
 Like this, the three of you are this different even using the same Jutsu.
 Well, this is a somewhat exaggerated comparison of you three,
 but you build up too much Chakra, use too much physical strength,
 and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.
 But, there’ve been times when I was greater than Sakura and Sasuke…
 That’s only because you happen to have
 the most outstanding stamina of the three!
 Well, I am pretty sure that your Chakra control
 is getting difficult due to the influence of the Nine-Tails…
 which is the origin of your stamina.
 Anyway, there is no mistaking that you can become strong
 if you carry out the training we will be doing from now.
 Huh?! Really?!
 I guarantee it.
 Now then, let’s go.
 Sir, your bill.
 Oh, that’s right.
 Wha--?!
 Thank you very much!
 We’ve come quite a long way…
 But, this is a hot spring town, right?
 It doesn’t look like we’ve come here to leisurely soak in a hot spring…
 Hey! Naruto!
 That’s the women’s bath!
 I simply will not allow indecent behavior!
 Huh?
 I’m not you…
 It’s not that I was trying to peep. Believe it!
 Thinking of something like that in the first place makes you a Closet Perv!
 What’s with that look?
 N-Nothing.
 More importantly, why’ve we come to a place like this?!
 Will soaking in a hot spring do anything for training?
 No!
 The training will be here in this hot spring area!
 Okay, this is the place.
 It’s a bath, sure enough!
 What are you saying?
 I said this is training, didn’t I? Training!
 We’re going to train here?
 What the heck are we going to do?
 Walk on this hot water!
 What?!
 What is it?
 Walk on hot water?
 Can you really do that?
 Of course!
 I heard from Kakashi Sensei.
 You already did tree-climbing training without using your hands, right?
 It’s an application of that.
 Hmm… 					What do you mean?
 Besides, I don’t really remember stuff from long ago!
 In tree climbing, all you do is accumulate
 only the necessary amount of Chakra in one necessary location
 and maintain that amount of Chakra all the while.
 Trees are fixed objects, so you only need to be attached to it.
 In other words,
 it’s training for building up a fixed amount of Chakra.
 To float on the surface of water,
 you have to discharge on a constant basis
 an appropriate amount of Chakra from your feet to the water
 and balance that to the extent that you can float your own body.
 Huh?
 This Chakra control is more difficult than maintaining…
 and is a control training for discharge and usage of fixed amount
 of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.
 Hmm, I really don’t get it!
 Well, it would be better to show you in your case.
 First, you build up Chakra in your feet.
 Then, while constantly discharging a fixed amount…
 you balance it with your body weight.
 And…
 well, this is how it goes.
 Oh! Okay! 					I’m going to try!
 First, you build up Chakra in your feet.
 Then!
 Discharge a fixed amount. Right?
 Oh!
 I knew it.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot!
 I forgot to mention it, but this hot water is 60° C.
 If you do nothing but fail…
 you will become a boiled octopus!
 Dang it!
 I’ll do it no matter what!
 You’re unusually spirited today, honored grandson!
 My principle of guidance has finally gotten through!
 This would ordinarily be the time to go carry out
 a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.
 I’ve stopped doing that now!
 That’s right!
 So you have finally understood.
 That the shortcut to becoming the Hokage is to do as I say…
 There are no shortcuts!
 Huh?
 Brother Naruto said it…
 If you’re to become Hokage, be prepared for that!
 Oh!
 I’m starting to get it!
 To think he would get the hang of the Chakra control this quickly…
 I never thought, you would grow this much.
 Indeed, there are no shortcuts, in anything…
 It appears I had the wrong idea about you…
 You are a much smarter teacher than I am.
 And, you were not just a Demon Fox…
 You were a splendid Hidden Leaf Village Ninja!
 Oh! Hot!
 Hm?! That is…!
 Humph! I don’t know who you are or where you’re from, but…
 I will not allow indecency!
 Man…
 T-That is!
 What?!
 Don’t make a ruckus.
 Jeez, it won’t do to be found out!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 There is no way that I alone can lose in a place like this!
 Guy Sensei…please allow it.
 It is now…
 A time to carry through and protect one’s own Way of the Ninja!
 The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born
 The color of his body changed…!
 He’s red…?!
 What’s up with him...?!
 He’s opened the third gate, the Gate of Life…
 He’s going to make his move!
 No, not yet!
 What?!
 And also,
 the fourth gate, the Gate of Pain…open!
 What an incredible guy…
 It’s not as though effort alone can make this happen…
 That boy…
 is he in fact a genius…?
 He’s fast!
 Gaara!
 Where are they?!
 He’s above!
 But we can’t find Lee!
 Where?!
 The sand isn’t keeping up at all!
 So it’s the Sand Armor again…?
 Then how’s this?!
 What…?!
 This Sand Armor is…
 being peeled away…!
 You’re a stubborn one.
 Since it comes to this…
 The muscles have torn…
 Is that really Lee…?
 When did he become like this…?
 This is the end!
 The Fifth Gate of Closing…open!
 I can’t defend myself…
 Is this the movement of a human being?!
 Neji…
 This technique is my ace in the hole to take you down…
 but I will specially show it to you!
 Huh?!
 The Sand Shield can’t keep up!
 Most of the armor has also  been peeled off…
 He’s done for!
 W-Wow!
 Hidden Lotus… In other words...
 it’s a high-speed continuous Taijutsu that can’t even be touched!
 The answer to take Neji down is that high speed combination…
 There is no way that the sand can keep up!
 This technique will be the last!
 Hidden Lotus!
 I can’t see anything, it’s too fast…
 That’s impossible…
 The gourd has turned to sand…?
 He’s done it this time!
 Gaara!
 Lee…
 Oh!
 What’s…that?
 He protects himself…
 using a gourd made of sand?!
 That technique is…!
 Sand Coffin!
 No way!
 He got hit by the Hidden Lotus
 and is still able to bring forth a technique…!
 Sand Coffin!
 I just can not lose in a place like this…
 I want to…
 my Way of the Ninja…
 Oh no!
 Die!
 Why…?
 Why…save him?
 He’s…
 I’m all right!
 I’m strong so…
 The Chunin Exam…
 Guy Sensei, please watch me with a smile...
 I’d like to prove that I could become a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 He is...
 an important subordinate whom I care for!
 A subordinate…whom I care for...?
 Those words are definitely not understandable to Gaara…
 I quit…
 He quit…?
 The moment Guy jumped in, Lee lost.
 The winner…
 Gaa-!
 – Wha…? 					– Huh?
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Wha--?!
 That’s impossible…
 Having opened the fifth gate…
 And his hand and feet are crushed…
 There’s no way he should be able to stand…!
 Lee…
 It’s all right.
 It’s over!
 You’re in no condition to stand…!
 Lee…
 Y-You…
 You are…
 Even after having lost consciousness…
 You still want to prove your own Way of the Ninja…?
 So he had already…
 lost consciousness…
 Lee...
 You’re already…
 a respectable Ninja…!
 The winner…
 Gaara.
 Lee!
 Stop!
 Even if you went down what could you do?
 Your words of encouragement would only make him feel worse.
 There’s no way he could have beaten Gaara…
 He was faced with a tougher battle than we thought…
 That Naruto…
 Bushy Brow lost to a guy like this…!
 Medics, please hurry.
 Bushy Brow…
 Lee…
 You are the Jonin in charge of him, aren’t you?
 Y-Yes.
 Please come with me for a minute.
 Careful…
 Don’t shake him.
 There is faint breathing…
 but because of comminuted fractures and muscle tears to his entire body,
 recovery will likely to take quite some time…
 If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad, but…
 The damage to the left arm and leg which received the attack is severe…
 It’s too severe…
 Oh…!
 I don’t want to say this,
 but he won't be able to... live as a Shinobi again.
 T-That…
 that can’t be true…
 I will take Bushy Brow down. Believe it!
 It is not you whom I want to fight, it’s Uchiha!
 You…!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably going  to be the one fighting Neji…
 Lee…
 I didn’t want to think... that you’d lose.
 I wanted to let you fulfill…
 your Way of the Ninja!
 Yay!
 I finally mastered it!
 Yahoo!
 This technique…
 after all, only Lee managed to master…
 Okay, you became Genin  from today.
 I want to hear what it is you all are aiming for!
 I-I’d like to prove that I can become a respectable Ninja
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Please forgive me for not…
 stopping it...!
 Lee…
 It’s not true…it’s not true.
 After hearing that, what should Bushy Brow do…?!
 This guy…
 He said the failure would take down a genius with effort…!
 Isn’t there something that can be done?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 B-But…Kakashi Sensei!
 He kept saying he wanted to battle Sasuke and Neji!
 Perhaps…that led to his ruin.
 To fulfill that dream…
 the boy even used a self-sacrificing forbidden technique to try to win!
 The result is what you see…
 That boy…
 Sasuke and Neji…
 and you…
 he sacrificed himself to a promise he never spoke of.
 He risked his life…
 so that he might have a chance to battle you guys…
 Don't forget that…
 I wonder if Lee…
 will be all right…?
 Lee…
 You didn’t realize it even at the end…
 Heaven does not allow it.
 One who tries to move ahead while achieving victory
 through a method like dying upon each other’s swords.
 So it ended without incident…
 Welcome back Gaara.
 Guy…
 Well…
 I spoke self-importantly earlier but…
 I’ve thought about it and had I been in your position…
 I probably... wouldn’t have been able to stop him.
 Guy.
 We’re in the way of the next tournament…let’s go up.
 All right…
 Then, the tenth and final round is next, both contestants come forward!
 So it’s finally my turn…
 I’m gonna win and have some barbecued beef!
 In any case, I need to last until the main tournament and battle Sasuke.
 Or I will not have met your expectations, Lord Orochimaru…
 I can almost see through it…
 The reason that you went to the trouble of getting to Sasuke before us and...
 putting a Curse Mark on him without killing him…
 In other words,
 we were the guinea pigs to measure Sasuke’s abilities during the examinations.
 What you wanted isn’t Sasuke’s life, but Sasuke himself…
 I was also taken for a fool…
 Now, let the tenth round begin.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Sakura!
 Do you know where Kakashi Sensei is?
 Naruto...
 I’m gonna have him watch my training until the main tournament.
 Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.
 What’s up with you, Sakura? You seem a little down.
 No, nothing…
 It’s just that I get this bad feeling…
 Next episode: “A Shadow in Darkness: Danger Approaches Sasuke”
 I feel uneasy for some reason…

 I like your determination!
 Then…
 For those who are still here…
 The first test...
 you have passed it!
 You’ve passed through the gates!
 The first test for the Chunin Exams has been completed…
 I wish you well.
 All right! Wish us well!
 What a funny guy…
 Huh…
 I didn’t think that there would be a guy who would pass the first test
 with a blank test sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki. He really is a funny guy.
 The Chunin Exam Stage 2: The Forest of Death!
 There’s something kind of creepy about this place.
 This place is called the Forest of Death, you’ll soon realize why.
 “The Forest of Death, you’ll soon realize why.”
 That kind of threat won’t work on me one bit!
 I’m not scared!
 Really?
 You’ve got a lot of energy.
 A kid like you dies at very beginning,
 dappled with the red blood I like.
 I’m returning your…Kunai Knife…
 Thank you for taking the trouble…
 But…don’t stand behind me, thirsty for blood.
 If you don’t want a quick death…
 Well, it’s my nature to act up at the sight of red blood.
 And my precious hair was cut, so I got excited…
 Naruto…
 I’m sorry…
 W-What with that Proctor?
 Frankly, she’s psycho!
 This one, too…
 That girl, why was her tongue so long?
 Evidently, we’ve got a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
 This will be fun.
 You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
 Well, before we start the second exam, I have to pass this out to you!
 It’s a consent form,
 before you can take part in the test you have to sign this.
 Why?
 From here on out, corpses are going to come out,
 I have to get your consent to that!
 Or it’ll be my responsibility.
 Well, I’m going to start the explanation for the second exam.
 In a word, the limits of your survival will be challenged.
 Survival, huh? This test is a total pain.
 First, I’ll give you step-by-step instruction on the terrain of this Training Field.
 Training Field Number 44 is surrounded by 44 locked entrance gates,
 there are rivers and a forest and a tower in the middle.
 It’s about 10 kilometers from the towers to the gate…
 In this confined area, you will go through a certain survival program.
 The contents of which are…
 anything goes scroll battle!
 Scroll…?
 Yes…
 I want you to fight for two scrolls, the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
 All together 26 teams got through the first test.
 Half of them...
 13 teams get the Heaven scroll, the other half get the Earth Scroll.
 I’ll hand over one scroll to each team.
 To put it simply,  that’s what you’re vying for.
 And the conditions to pass?
 Three of you bring both the Heaven and Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
 That means that of the 13 teams, half of them will fail for sure…
 Except it has to be in time.
 For this second exam, the time limit is 120 hours.
 Do it in exactly five days!
 Five days.
 What do we do about food?
 Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trove in the wilderness.
 There’s more than enough for food…
 However…
 It’s teeming with fierce people-eating animals,
 poison bugs, poisonous weeds and much more.
 No way…
 Fool, that’s why it’s called survival!
 Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people, 13 teams will pass.
 The interval for activity gets longer with passing each day,
 while the time for recovery gets shorter…
 Seems pretty grueling!
 On top of that, you’re surrounded by nothing but enemies,
 even falling asleep will be a problem…
 And, besides those injured during attempts to capture scrolls…
 there will definitely be people
 are unable to endure the rigors of the course.
 Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it?
 According to the rules, you cannot give up in the middle of it!
 I want you to spend five days in the forest.
 Just like I thought…
 This is going to be a pain!
 Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
 Number 1, if all three members of the team can’t make it to the tower
 with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls within the time limit.
 Number 2, if a team loses a member or if a member became incapacitated.
 There’s that, and this is a supplement…
 Absolutely do not look at the contents of the scrolls
 until you have reached the tower!
 W-What happens if we look at it halfway through?
 When you look at it you’ll find…out!
 Huh?
 There are times when a Chunin must deal with super-secret text.
 This is to test your reliability.
 That’s all the explanation!
 I’ll exchange your three consent forms for the scrolls in that hut over there.
 After that, pick your entrance, and all the gates will open simultaneously!
 Finally, just a word of advice…
 Don’t die!
 I see, so you won’t know which scroll was given to each team…
 and you won’t know which of the three people is carrying the scroll.
 If what Ibiki said was right,
 there will be life or death struggles for information in this test.
 Everyone is an enemy!
 The resolve of everyone here is strong.
 That means that it might come to killing each other.
 It looks like they understand the meaning of the consent form a little bit…
 Heeey, look who’s here!
 It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it?
 I thought you went home long ago, I never imagined you were still here.
 Ooooh? Look who’s here, the ugly Inopig.
 Starting now, it's five days of the survival test with Sasuke.
 There’s no reason to go home.
 – Ugly! 					– Billboard!
 – Ugly! Ugly! – Billboard! Billboard!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly! – Billboard, billboard, billboard!
 – Billboard, billboard, billboard! – Ugly ugly ugly!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly! – Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
 Sakura, this is impossible for you.
 For your own sake, just hurry up and go home!
 I could say the exact same thing to you!
 Hey, why are those two on such bad terms?
 D-Do you think I care about something stupid like that?
 Man…all there is to do is write my name,
 why does it take this much time!
 Hey! Hinata! What are you doing over there?
 N-Naruto…
 Umm…uhhhh…well…
 Just like I thought, this kid is strange.
 A scratch…
 Uh-um… this…is--
 See ya!
 Naruto…
 It’s about time for the scroll exchange.
 Well, I wonder how many teams will survive…
 Teams who have taken the scroll,
 stay with the representative and move to the gate!
 We’ll all start simultaneously in 30 minutes!!
 Yeah! Survival is our forte!
 Hinata, don’t show your weakness.
 Uh, okay…
 Life or death…
 It’s a pain but we just have to do this.
 Since it’s come to this, Naruto will be our target.
 For snacks, there’s potato chips...
 – What about shortcake...? – I can’t believe you two!
 Okaaaay! I won’t lose!
 I’ll bring down whoever comes near me.
 – Yes! 					– Cha!
 Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here…
 We have the chance to fulfill our mission in earnest…
 Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
 I’m really scared of spending five days with this guy.
 Target the rookies first.
 They said that from now on it’s okay to kill,
 which makes it easier.
 Master Guy, I’ll do my best! I’ll definitely succeed!
 We now start the second test of the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! Let’s go!
 Okay! First, we search for that thing.
 Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Byakugan!
 Slow down, Lee! We just started.
 I know. But…
 I can’t stay still!
 Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us.
 Hot-blooded fool…
 As you already understand, we have only one target!
 W-What are you doing, Choji?
 Just a little break… I’m already tired, and hungry…
 What are you suddenly saying?!
 It hasn’t been five minutes since we started!
 But I can’t help it. I’m hungry…
 You! If you were able to bring snacks,
 you should have been able to bring one Kunai knife!
 Ino! Hide!
 Uh-oh!
 This kind of thing continuing  for five days…?
 Anyway, the tower is the goal for everyone, right?
 So it would be clever for us to make a trap in the vicinity of the tower.
 Okay…wasting no time, huh?
 Where are they?
 Heh…kids.
 It’s like begging to be found, standing in that conspicuous place.
 They sensed our presence,
 but, evidently they haven’t grasped where we are.
 What happened? 					You’re pale.
 W-What is that?!
 The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village sense body temperature and perspiration,
 then in mass, swoop down on their prey.
 If they continue to suck your blood for five minutes,
 you go to the other world…
 Using this behavior,
 we’d set a trap on the path enemies would use to escape.
 D-Darn it…
 That’s one team gone!
 It sounds like they’ve already started.
 Wasn't that someone screaming just now?
 I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing. Sakura. Believe it!
 I-I have to pee…
 Y-You…fool!
 What are you doing in front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Aaah, that was a lot! I’m refreshed.
 Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
 S-Sasuke… no matter what, you don’t have to go that far.
 W-What was that for…?
 What are you doing…all of a sudden?!
 What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it?
 Sasuke!
 It can’t be helped!
 Sasuke, please stop!
 Look closely at him!
 Talk! Where’s the real Naruto!
 I have no idea what you’re talking about!
 What happened to the scratch on you face?
 I’m asking what happened to the scratch you got before from the Proctor!
 And your Shuriken holster is on your left leg.
 That guy’s right handed!
 You’re worse at transformation than Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky! You got me. ln that case…
 Which one of you got the scroll?
 If you listen to me obediently, I’ll spare your lives.
 I see! Then I’ll resort to force!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Aww, stupid gas mask man!
 Suddenly sneaking up on someone when they're peeing!
 I messed up just a little bit.
 Now I have to hurry and meet up with Sakura.
 Wait a minute! What is this giant snake?
 Hey! Are you serious?! Wait a minute, hey!
 I've been gulped down!

20,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 I guess the storm is going to come soon…
 Let’s hurry and head back to the curry shop.
 Oh my.
 That thunder right now…
 came from the direction of the Katabami Gold Mine…
 Raiga's Counterattack
 B-Boss.
 R-Ranmaru!
 Hey, wake up, Ranmaru!
 Quit joking around. I’m not laughing…
 Hey…Ranmaru…!
 You… What did you do to Ranmaru?
 N-No! He…
 When Ranmaru held your hand…
 you revived and…
 And then…Ranmaru…
 Ranmaru…
 Why is Raiga up?!
 I must stop him.
 Thunder?
 Could it be?!
 You’re slow!
 Are you…that brat’s comrade…?
 If it’s a wooden weapon, then…
 But I can’t hold it over my head…
 You’re annoying!
 You little fly…!
 Quit buzzing!
 I’m…not smart, you know…
 Huh…?
 I don’t know why this happened…
 Hey, whose fault is it? Yours?!
 N-No! That’s not true!
 Perhaps…the guys from the Leaf…
 Oh yeah… lf they didn’t come,
 then Ranmaru and I would have been together forever…
 Where are they?!
 You know, don’t you?! lf you don’t know, I’ll kill you!
 I know…
 Maybe…!
 Take me…where they are…
 Go!
 Yes!
 Hold on, Ranmaru. For your funeral…
 I’ll offer up their corpses for you.
 Ranmaru…
 This child… Did he give up his life in order to revive Raiga?
 Rai…ga… Rai…
 Ranmaru! You're alive!
 Hang in there! Ranmaru!
 Ranmaru!
 It started raining.
 But we’re almost done.
 Oh my, I’m happy that you all did this much for me.
 Oh no!
 Mom! Something horrible happened!
 Oh my… What happened, Karashi?
 Tenten is…!
 What happened to Tenten?
 She…fell from a cliff and..
 What?!
 What do you mean?!
 I was running with her and
 Tenten said that she would train me in place of Lee…
 But there…when we were approaching the Lightning Pass,
 the lightning struck and a tree came falling and
 Tenten fell from the Pass to the bottom of the cliff!
 Oh my! Then you must go help her out immediately!
 Let’s go to help, Tenten!
 Yeah!
 Umm… No, I will…
 I will come after you guys with the first-aid kit.
 Okay.
 Let’s go, Naruto, Lee.
 – Yes! 					– Right!
 Oh my, Karashi?
 Mom, we’re running away from here.
 What are you saying, child?!
 Never mind that!
 I’ll explain it later, so hurry up and get ready.
 I will wait at the Lightning Pass.
 Bring them for sure. If not…
 I’ll offer up you and your mom’s corpses to Ranmaru…
 Mom, please!
 I don’t want to!
 I'm going to wait until everybody comes back!
 Mom! You are so stubborn!
 Just come with me!
 Do you think that Tenten would fall off a cliff
 merely because of the thunder?
 Huh? What do you mean?
 That Karashi… lt seems like he wasn’t trained enough.
 I’m sorry…
 Then…
 Perhaps…it’s some kind of trap again.
 Or he’s been threatened by someone…
 But the Kurosuki Family is…!
 Maybe my eyes were cloudy…
 No way!
 It’s him…
 He’s burning up with fever…
 Raiga…?
 He revived, so you should too…
 It’s all right. I’m going to die soon anyway.
 No way! I’m not going to let you say that you're going to die so easily!
 The people who were killed by you and Raiga died against their will!
 I’m not going to let it go your way!
 For the sake of those whose freedoms you took away.
 I’m going to have you take responsibility!
 Are you okay?
 The storm… It’ll be dangerous to stay here…
 To Grandma’s place.
 You’ve come!
 Raiga!
 So he is alive.
 This time I’ll take you down for sure!
 Let’s go!
 That’s not good! Lee!
 What are you…?
 What is this?
 It’s in a whole different level from before…!
 Probably that attack was lightning made of Chakra.
 But this one…
 Real lightning is used as the source…
 If he can utilize the power of nature, unlike Chakra, he’ll have no limits!
 Get down!
 Byakugan!
 If we dodge through the electric shock and
 take this to a close-range battle…

 I know it!

 Good job, Naruto!
 Gentle Fist!
 Neji!
 You brats! Is that all you know?
 Unlike the natural thunder power I’m using,
 Chakra has its limits!
 Huh…?
 You’re an idiot! There’s an idiot here!
 Is that what you say to an opponent who fought with all his power?!
 Huh?
 You again…
 This time I’m not going to have a funeral for you!
 I am angry.
 Oh my, what are you doing?!
 Please Mom, come with me!
 There’s no time.
 No, I’m going to stay here!
 Oh Tenten!
 Oh my! This stupid son of mine!
 I couldn’t help it, because the boss came back to life…
 If we stay here, we’re going to get killed.
 The only choice we have is to run away!
 If you want to run away, then go.
 I’m not running away.
 I’m not going to give up, I will save this child.
 I will feed this boy the curry of life!
 Grandma…
 It’s the curry that revived Lee.
 Yes.
 If anything happens, it’s not my fault!
 You!
 One, two…
 One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 One, two… One, two…
 This is bad…
 This is really bad!
 Eat this…you’ll feel better.
 Please.
 You messed up on mixing the spices.
 Oh my?!
 Karashi, could you have memorized my recipe of the curry of life?
 Karashi…
 This is the true curry of life.
 Here, please eat this.
 You can’t even eat if you’re not with Raiga?
 Why…?
 Why…for a person like me?
 Does one need a reason to save someone?
 To save you,
 Grandma Sansho and Karashi did their best to make the curry.
 Don’t you feel anything seeing those two trying their best?
 If you don’t feel anything, you’re a horrible human being!
 Human beings support each other in order to live…
 If there are people who need help, don’t others naturally lend them a hand?
 Isn’t that being human?
 Anyway, one bite is fine. Why don’t you try it?
 Was it good?
 That is what it feels like to live.
 Raiga …
 I want him to eat this curry too.
 Let’s go.
 I’m far from finished…!
 This guy… What is up with him?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Damn it! What in the world happened to my body?!
 It is pitch black in front of me, my entire body is numb,
 and my body doesn’t do what I want it to do.
 What is this feeling…?
 It’s warm, my entire body is burning,
 and what is this taste that brings energy up from the bottom of my stomach…?

21,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Is this really Moso’s house?
 Here he’s a superintendant officer,
 so I thought it’d be a more luxurious building with gold folding screens.
 Your voices are too loud.
 Lord Moso is a magnificent person with no self-interests.
 So he lives frugally.
 But you know, he’s an old man
 who’s the second most important guy in the land next to the feudal lord, right?
 He smacks of being really poor.
 Naruto!
 Well well, how shameful of me to present such a poor residence.
 Lord Moso.
 What?!
 This old man like from some dumpling shop?
 I’m an old man from a dumpling shop?
 Geez, unbelievable!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Neji?!
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 So you are Ninja who came from the Village Hidden in Leaves?
 From the right, this is Naruto, Neji and Tenten.
 I hear you encountered the Cursed Warrior that appeared
 in Lord Komei’s residence last night.
 Yes.
 So, how did it go?
 Did you figure out the true identity of the Cursed Warrior?
 Yeah, it’s a real ghost.
 Oh, a ghost, huh?
 Don’t be jumping to conclusions on your own.
 But he appears all of a sudden and flies around.
 Yeah, and on top of that, the inside of his armor was empty.
 No matter how bizarre the thing, there’s always a trick.
 I’ll pin down the true identity without fail.
 That is encouraging…
 We have just changed feudal lords and the public is still anxious.
 Please eliminate the rumors of the Cursed Warrior as soon as possible.
 I beg of you.
 Please!
 Tsurucho Yakitori
 Here are your chicken wings.
 Oh, here we go!
 They look tasty!
 Hot!
 That Moso superintendant officer seems like a good guy.
 Yes. It was also Lord Moso who came to my rescue
 and selected me to be a page.
 The son of the feudal lord succeeds him
 and an excellent superintendant officer offers him tutelage…
 The government appears to be stable, but…
 Then why is there a strange rumor going around
 about the haunting of the previous feudal lord?
 There’s probably somebody displeased
 with this dramatic replacement of the feudal lord.
 Do you have any idea who it might be?
 Well, it might be Lord Komei, after all.
 Isn't that the name of the tactician you were talking about
 who wanted to become the feudal lord?
 Then why did the Cursed Warrior appear in his residence?
 Perhaps to deflect attention.
 That’s it. 					I bet that’s it.
 All right, since it’s come to this,
 if we can nab that old man called Komei or whatever
 and quickly get him to own up…
 Guys, let’s get fired up and get going!
 Idiot. We can’t do something like that without proof.
 He is a tactician of this land more or less, so.
 Oh man, that’s no fun.
 First, I want to meet Lord Sagi, the feudal lord.
 That’s not possible. Lord Sagi does not like to meet anybody.
 Don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud. Let us meet him, okay?
 You’re a “nipple” friend, right?
 If you’re going to say that, say, “childhood friend.”
 Huh?
 Can we really meet him in a place like this?
 This lake holds fond memories for Lord Sagi.
 And…for me as well.
 In our young days,
 Lord Sagi always played with his little sister Lady Toki here.
 He might come here around about today with his attendants…
 If we’re lucky.
 It’s up to luck, huh?
 It’s Lord Sagi.
 Lord Sagi, we have arrived.
 Thank you.
 Oh wow… So that’s Lord Sagi, huh?
 He’s cute. He is kind of my liking…
 My watch has remained stopped since that time.
 Hey, what’s he doing?
 He’s probably reminiscing.
 The only thing that can comfort Lord Sagi’s heart
 is his memories with Lady Toki.
 Byakugan.
 Where is it?
 Where’s this bloodthirsty aura coming from?
 It’s not above ground?
 Could it be, underwater…?
 Assassins! Protect Lord Sagi!
 I don’t think so!
 Who the heck are you guys?
 Damn it! I won’t let you get away.
 Wait, Naruto!
 What is it?
 A letter bomb in the water.
 That was a close one.
 If you’d chased after them as is, you would’ve been totally entangled.
 Settle down.
 Lord Sagi!
 Are you all right?!
 Yes, I’m fine.
 Thank goodness!
 Lord Sagi, these three are Ninja from the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 They came to investigate the true identity of the Cursed Warrior.
 That was unnecessary. I bet it was that  Moso’s idea?
 It was all because he was worried for your life, Lord Sagi.
 The fact is, if these people were not here now…
 Silence.
 Y-Yes, my lord.
 Hey-hey, do you really not get how this guy feels?!
 Chishima was seriously worried about you.
 Without his passionate friendship,
 the Hidden Leaf Village wouldn’t have taken action with that low commission fee.
 I am not obliged.
 How bothersome!
 Say what?!
 Friendship is in the past.
 I became a feudal lord and he is a mere page.
 We are now standing on different surfaces.
 Say that again! I’ll slug the guy who tramples on friendship--!
 Let it go, Naruto.
 What’re you doing?! Let go of me!
 I have to give guys like this a good thumping!
 You are talking about a feudal lord!
 It would have been better had it pierced my throat.
 Go.
 Yes, my lord.
 Jeez, who does he think he is?!
 Jeez, a feudal lord.
 Please forgive him.
 What? You don’t have a problem with being told off like that?!
 He wasn’t like that in the old days.
 His father and little sister died in succession
 and he became cold-hearted.
 So that’s what it was.
 I’m sure the day will come
 when he will turn back into the kind-hearted Lord Sagi.
 I don’t know about that.
 The Shuriken from before.
 This is an odd shape.
 Hm? Let me have a look.
 Oh!
 Does it look familiar to you or something?
 Y-Yes. There are no Ninja in the Land of Birds.
 But there are guardsmen receiving special training.
 Is it a weapon those people use?
 Yes.
 Who commands those guardsmen?
 The person who organizes them is Lord Komei the tactician.
 Say what?!
 Komei again.
 Komei must have originally thought to mislead the public with the Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to create a rift between Lord Sagi and Moso.
 But the relationship between the two is tight.
 And by Moso summoning us here, he probably sensed that the day
 was approaching when the truth behind the incident would be revealed
 and he plotted to assassinate Lord Sagi.
 If we’ve figured out that much, let’s charge on in--!
 Hold your horses, Naruto.
 We have to find more hard evidence.
 Hey, is that how it is?
 Yeah, that’s how it is.
 Neji, look at that.
 No doubt, it’s Komei!
 To think he’d go out without attendants
 even though the Cursed Warrior might appear.
 All right, let’s follow him.
 This is the temple where the Cursed Warrior appeared last night.
 Something smells fishy.
 He’s shown up…!
 Byakugan.
 What’s this?!
 There’s no need to waver anymore!
 Hey! Wait.
 I’ve witnessed the true identity of the ghost!
 Who’s there?
 Hey hey, Komei!
 You’re the one responsible for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 What?
 H-Hold it!
 Naruto, get down!
 I did it!
 Damn it! No good.
 This thing’s not just a ghost, after all.
 A tornado?
 I can’t see the Cursed Warrior!
 Byakugan.
 A Shuriken Shadow Clone?!
 8 Trigrams Palm Rotation!
 What’re you letting your mind drift for?!
 Sorry… I never thought a ghost could use Ninjutsu.
 It’s not a ghost inside the armor. lt’s a Shinobi.
 And quite a wily one at that.
 This is the same shape as the shuriken from this afternoon.
 He’s an important witness. Take him alive.
 Leave it to me!
 But we can’t take him alive
 if we don’t do something about that tornado.
 Naruto.
 I’m counting on you!
 Right. I’ll try!
 Tenten, use as many weapons as possible and draw his attention.
 Roger.
 No good. No effect at all.
 That’s fine. Just keep at it.
 Neji…now!
 Gentle Fist Technique, 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms.
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms.
 All right, we did it!
 We’ll find out the true identity for sure this time.
 Show us your real face.
 What’s this?
 It’s empty again.
 This can’t be!
 Lord Komei, we have seized from a storeroom in your residence,
 one suit of white armor along with guardsmen Shuriken.
 We would like you to report to the magistrate’s office
 as a material witness in the recent Cursed Warrior incident
 as well as the attempted assassination of Lord Sagi.
 I have no choice.
 Thank you very much.
 With this, Lord Sagi’s heart should settle down somewhat.
 Case closed.
 Still, they were sure prepared.
 Here an hour has barely passed since contacting Moso.
 At that time…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 There was a human presence in tonight’s Cursed Warrior.
 The presence of someone alive.
 A presence?
 But you said you didn’t feel such a presence in the first Cursed Warrior.
 Yeah.
 Hey, what does that mean?
 In other words, the two Cursed Warrior are separate beings.
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 How can we go back to the village when there's all this mystery?
 If we're gonna investigate, this has to be it.
 What? Could this black thing be…?
 I get it! We use this to get through the dark…
 Hey, why did we end up in a place like this?!

 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?

 Sasuke!
 Why…?!
 Why do you run away?!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t…
 be staring at…
 people!
 He’s faster than earlier!
 The medicine from earlier…
 Was there some kind of special ingredient in it or something…?
 Not…bad…
 Moving around kind of… made me feel super weird…
 Oh, my…!
 What was that…all of a sudden…?
 Did he really…fall asleep…?
 You fell for it, eh?!
 It looked like I was sleeping, but actually I wasn’t!
 This is the Shinobi secret…!
 Guy Sensei…I did it!
 Guy Sensei…I…I…
 You fell for it yet again, huh?! Hey!
 You’re sorely mistaken if you think I’m the kind of person
 to sleep spread-eagle in a place like this!
 I…I…
 What…? What am I doing in a place like this…?
 What…?
 Why…? Why…?
 Alcohol…?
 He’s just drunk, huh…?
 If so…I’ll send you to another world before you can even feel pain…
 Damn it… I don’t have enough Chakra…
 At this rate…
 As might be expected, things will get hairy
 if I stay in the water any longer with this wound…
 Why won’t it hit?!
 And here I was sleeping comfortably…
 You’re a buzzing, annoying fly!
 Hey! Bring it on! Hey c’mon… I’ll show you…
 What’re…those movements…?
 As you know, in that technique…
 one gets stronger the more one drinks and the more one gets drunk.
 I know…
 At the restaurant before…
 When Lee mistook it for water and drank a small cup of alcohol…
 It took Neji and me, the both of us, to finally…be able to overpower Lee.
 You couldn’t restrain him yourself…?
 I could overpower him if I was fighting him as an enemy…
 But well, I couldn’t inflict a serious injury on my beloved student…
 That’s right…
 That’s how it was just with one small cup, so…
 If he were to drink an entire bottle of alcohol…
 An invincible strength, huh…?
 But it’s just after he got out of the hospital.
 How long will his body hold on for…?
 A Loopy Fist User, huh…? lt’s my first time seeing one…
 If you’re not going to come… then I’ll go!
 His attacks are straight as usual…
 Oh!
 Ouch!
 It’s your fault!
 I…I…!
 I’m enjoying my youth!
 He’s too unorthodox…
 And most of all…he’s fast!
 Right in the middle of my youth…
 Dance of the Camellia!
 Here!
 I can’t read his movements…
 An attack on me… That’s quite some Taijutsu…
 I have no choice…
 My attack ability is bones…
 You heard that earlier from the Clone brat, right…?
 I’ll sober you up right away.
 I’m…not drunk…or anything!
 Then I’ll wake you up!
 I’m not drunk or anything!
 In the first place, I’m a minor!
 Minors shouldn’t drink at all!
 Unorthodox, isn’t it…? This is my Kekkei Genkai.
 Calm down…Think of a strategy…
 Seek…some kind of possibility…
 Humph. With that wound…
 It seems he wasn’t able to escape very far at all…
 This is my limit… I can’t move…
 Damn it… He’s already caught up?
 And…
 My head’s pounding…
 And what’s with this wound…?
 It seems I was drunk, eh…?
 Your appearance…!
 It seems you’ve sobered up… This is my Kekkei Genkai…
 Kekkei Genkai…
 My Kekkei Genkai freely controls osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells…
 It even controls the concentration of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.
 Basically, there are over two hundred bones in the human body…
 But for me, that’s not a set number.
 But bones are bones, after all!
 If they break, they break!
 Wh-What a hardness…!
 Are these really human bones…?!
 If so…!
 Larch Dance.
 I’ve had it…
 A little more…you clod.
 It’s not like the time before with Asuma…
 A-Asuma!
 There’s probably zero possibility of someone coming to help...
 Hey, what’s the point of thinking about someone helping…?!
 Calm down!
 The smell is moving away…
 I’m saved…
 Who is?
 How…?!
 I knew it…
 My coat?!
 It seems you didn’t notice your own smell that you’re routinely used to smelling…
 With that you erased your own smell?
 You understand well the attributes of scent. lt figures why I didn’t smell you.
 And…as would be expected,
 it’s tough having you guys split up in two to search for me…
 Damn it…
 Please wait!
 The real deal…is from now!
 My role now is to stall this person as long as possible…
 So, I should’ve avoided a big technique that could be self-defeating…
 But it seems this isn’t an opponent easy enough to be able to beat
 without using my Secret Technique…
 Here I go!
 I just had surgery and am not at my best.
 But if it’d just be opening the first of the Eight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,
 I should somehow…
 The first gate… Gate of Opening…
 Open!
 Primary Lotus!
 The impact of the kick was suppressed by the bones…?!
 That’s some speed… But it’s over.
 Damn it… No matter how much I think, I can’t come up with any good strategies!
 I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
 With me right in front of you, you can’t even howl like a loser…?
 Eh?!
 Die!
 You’re mine!
 Don’t you be smiling before you’re going to die!
 What?!
 Who’re you?!
 Heh… It seems you’re an ally this time…
 Who’re you?!
 A Sand…
 Shinobi…
 ally of the Leaf!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I heard that the Sand and Leaf had made up, but…
 It wasn’t that we attacked the Leaf Village for the fun of it.
 It was just a mission, same as this time.
 Humph! I see.
 By the way, weren’t you three headed this way together?
 We had no choice. Since you guys are weak…

 What’s the matter? Aren’t you coming?
 You jerk…!
 Hey, Naruto!
 Stop that!
 You idiot.
 Naruto!
 Hey, hey.
 Should you really be worrying about others right now?
 He’s fast!
 And what’s more, such power…
 So this is the power Lord Orochimaru was talking about…
 Amazing… It’s almost scary…
 Don’t you agree, Iruka?
 Mizuki, please stop.
 Please…!
 Tsubaki…
 I don’t care what happens to me…
 I just don’t want you to commit any more crimes.
 Please!
 Return to the village.
 Tsubaki… If you care that much about me,

 You sure haven’t made any progress, have you?
 He vanished!
 He didn’t vanish. He’s just fast.

 In that case…
 Everybody, better be very aware of your surroundings!
 I call it Uzumaki Whirpool Formation!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 I see…
 Even an idiot like him comes up with an idea once in a while.
 In that case…
 I want to watch you experience even deeper despair…
 Despair that’s equal to that wisdom you’ve managed to muster!
 There he is!
 I see him!
 It’s not that you saw me.
 I’m going out of my way to show myself to you.
 There!
 Damn… Even though I can see him, I‘m unable to land any blows.
 I’m telling you, I’m not foreseeing your movements.
 You’re just sluggish.
 Oww…
 Hey, serves you right.
 You demon fox.
 Don’t be so delighted in such a big way.
 You’ll now get a taste of the same agony I have endured.
 Starting now, right, Naruto?
 There’s still much more to come!
 Stop that, Mizuki! Don’t lay your hands on Naruto!
 Shut up, Iruka!
 Do you have any idea how much I’ve been waiting for this moment?
 I’ve been waiting for this day ever since then.
 For this time of revenge.
 I will use this power of mine
 and take my own good time to crush each of you, one at a time.
 Come on, stand up, Iruka. I’ll start by killing this guy.
 Mizuki…!
 There you go. 					That’s good!
 Come on!
 You are pathetic.
 There’s a world of difference between us, isn’t there?
 I’ve gotten my hands on this extreme body
 and it is your fate to die wretchedly.
 What do you mean,  ""extreme body""?
 When your power depends on potions,
 it’s not true power!
 That sounds just like the half-baked guy you are…
 In that case, go ahead and try winning…
 Using that real power you’re talking about!
 I’m different from you. You're gonna live out your life…
 as some lowly teacher who never thinks  about getting ahead in life,
 who only gets used by the village in whatever way they see fit.
 How do you like…this power… and the way I carry myself?!
 Even if you trained a hundred years,
 you'll never be able to earn it!
 I’m not gonna stop here!
 I’m still gonna get much much stronger…
 I’ll get Orochimaru to share his Hidden Jutsu with me.
 Do you really think that will happen?
 I’m getting tired of you playing the martyr.
 I think it’s about time to end this.
 Isn’t this nostalgic…?
 This time, I’ll get you for sure.
 So prepare yourself.
 Naruto!
 You jerk! Don’t you dare lay your hands on Iruka Sensei!
 This is really something!
 Every little thing is exactly the same as it was that other time.
 But I’ve changed.
 The reason for my defeat that time…
 was that I let my guard down to the demon fox that you are.
 Wh-What’s that?!
 I won’t let my guard down again.
 I’ll call upon all my strength to beat you down!
 Bring it on!
 I’m sorry…both of you…
 Choji!
 Damn… If only I had a little more information about those guys…
 Elder Brother… My body feels lighter.
 Yeah, Raijin, it feels lighter, doesn’t it?
 Okay, time for clobbering…
 Yeah! Clobbering!
 There they come.
 Damn it!
 Huh?
 What the hell is this?!
 M-My body…
 Doesn’t move…!
 Huh? Genjutsu Paralysis?
 Looks like I made it in time.
 Good work! Shikamaru, Ino, Choji!
 Leave the rest to me!
 The F-Fifth Hokage!
 No way… Lady Hokage…in person?!
 Lady Tsunade.
 I’m sorry I found out about this so late.
 But I wouldn’t have imagined
 that these guys were hanging out with Mizuki…
 Fifth Hokage!
 We are saved…!
 Uh…uh…Elder Brother…
 Oh…Oh…
 Well, we run into each other in unusual places, don’t we,
 Fujin and Raijin?
 T-Tsunade…
 Let me ask what you’re doing here.
 Powerful.
 More like, scary.
 Now then, is there something you want to say?
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
 Please forgive me. We’ll never do it again!
 So you guys went with Mizuki because he told you that
 you’d be able to eat something good at Orochimaru’s place?
 – I’m, I’m sorry. – I’m, I’m sorry.
 No way we could stand up to guys on the same level as the Three Legendary Ninja.
 But I wonder what happened between them the past…
 to make those two that scared.
 No thanks. I don’t even want to imagine what it might be.
 Gimme a break. Falling for such an obvious bait!
 Mizuki has apparently gone into those mountains up ahead.
 Naruto and Iruka are probably with him…
 You guys come along after recuperating a little.
 Huh…wait a minute.
 What are we going to do with these two guys?
 Huh? You don’t need to worry about that…
 More importantly, I can’t let them cause any more trouble.
 I’ve decided to make these guys go home on their own.
 Hey, Fujin, Raijin. I assume you understand this already,
 but if you’re even one minute late you’re not getting any dinner.
 – Yes, ma’am! 					– Yes, ma’am!
 We can’t be doing this, Raijin.
 Let’s hurry back to the institution.
 Elder Brother, dinner, right?!
 Dinner!
 – Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner… – Dinner, dinner, dinner, dinner…
 Amazing… what incredible speed.
 It’s very important for a person to eat, after all.
 That’s just you.
 Damn! His power is even greater than earlier!
 But I can’t let him take me down.
 This guy may have a lead to Sasuke’s whereabouts.
 Naruto!
 Iruka, are you all right?
 Yes...
 Did you notice?
 What?
 Although that jerk’s power has increased multifold,
 the sharpness of his movements is diminishing.
 Huh?
 Did he transfer the Chakra he was using for speed, to power?
 I don’t really know that, but…
 That’s quite a heavy burden for Naruto to bear alone.
 But if that guy’s speed has diminished,
 there might be a chance to win.
 All right… You hang in there a little bit more, Naruto!
 How about this, you little brat?
 Do you like the power of this body that Lord Orochimaru gave me!
 I’ll tear you apart.
 Where the hell is he…?
 That Orochimaru… Where is he?
 Why would I tell a little brat like you that kind of thing?
 He wasn’t in the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound? Did you go there?!
 The compound was already totally empty…
 Neither Sasuke nor Orochimaru was there anymore.
 You really gave that one a lot of thought for a guy like you, huh…
 I don’t know where you heard that about the Village Hidden in the Sound…
 but if you’re trying to fluster me by talking rubbish like that,
 it’s not gonna happen.
 Give up ‘cause you’re going to the next world.
 Listen carefully. Don’t you dare talk that kind of trash again!
 Naruto, this way.
 Iruka Sensei…
 Just try to catch me!
 You jerk…don’t even think I’m gonna let you get away!
 Now! Jump up, Naruto!
 All right!!
 Damn…this is…!
 Seal and Capture Perimeter!
 The Capture and Arrest Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto, that Jutsu is…
 So that’s the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu… Rasengan…
 Are you all right, Iruka Sensei?
 Naruto, that was spectacular. Good work!
 Listen Sensei…
 It looks like this guy didn’t know about the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 So I was thinking that he’s no longer… with Orochimaru…
 Don’t talk trash…
 Mizuki…
 You gotta be kidding…
 This is an extreme body that I received from Lord Orochimaru…
 I will go to the Village of Hidden Sound and become even more…
 Iruka Sensei What’s this?!
 It’s just as I thought, after all.
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Lady Tsunade.
 His cells have started dying.
 You jerk… What have you done to me?!
 It’s not Naruto’s fault.
 It’s caused from the substances you took!
 What? That’s impossible!
 You’re getting a taste of your own medicine.
 That substance wasn’t fully developed yet.
 The last casualty has been recovered.
 It appears that Shizune was injured, but there’s no threat to her life.
 I see. Thanks for your work.
 That’s a relief… Shizune is safe.
 Orochimaru probably developed that substance by chance
 while he was trying to develop a Forbidden Jutsu.
 What is certain is that
 that substance assimilates the DNA of animals
 and when it combines with the human body
 that serves to draw out its power in an explosive manner.
 But its effect is only short term.
 And in exchange, it puts a strain on the cells
 that far exceeds the limits of the human body.
 It certainly isn’t something that’s one could actually use.
 But why did Mizuki…?
 I don’t know the details
 but it must be that Mizuki and Orochimaru
 had a point of contact in the past…
 However…
 That tie has already been severed.
 Yes, unfortunately Orochimaru just used him as a plaything.
 Giving him an unusable drug… he’s probably laughing his butt off.
 But Mizuki is one lucky guy…
 An ordinary Shinobi would have lost his life.
 Although he won’t be able to live his life as a Shinobi any more.
 Unfortunate, isn’t it, Naruto?
 I kind of had that feeling anyway…
 I see.
 But I won’t give up!
 I will continue to do my best to search for clues to Sasuke’s whereabouts.
 Tsubaki…
 Damn it, Iruka!
 Don’t talk!
 Next time I’ll take you and that little squirt down without fail.
 There’s no way you could do that.
 While you were pursuing your futile dream,
 Naruto’s been actively honing his skills.
 You can’t possibly catch up with him any longer.
 Mizuki can never go back to being a Shinobi again…
 Tsubaki…
 I’m thinking of starting over again too…
 But first I must atone for all the trouble I caused the village…
 What a beautiful sunset.
 Let’s return to the village.
 Dried and Canned Goods
 Fish Market
 I won't…
 ever give up either!
 I did it!
 All right, since everybody worked so hard today,
 I’m going to do something special and treat you all to a meal at Ichiraku.
 Yippee! You’re a real man, lruka Sensei!
 I want a block of barbecued pork!
 I want large portions of all three kinds of ramen noodles –
 miso, soy sauce and butter!
 Hey, Iruka, before you do that,
 you and Naruto need to go to Leaf Village Hospital.
 Huh…I told you I’m okay.
 Don’t argue with me.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I cleared the first stage!
 She’s just started her ascetic training…
 Could she be an exceptional talent on par with Shizune…?
 Hey, Sakura…!
 This time you saved me…
 You’ve really become stronger, haven’t you, Naruto.
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 I can't stand it any longer!
 No matter how long I wait, there's no clue  about Sasuke's whereabouts!
 And yet, Old Lady Tsunade keeps telling me not to do a thing!
 At this rate, we'll never find Sasuke!
 Isn't there anything?
 Something, anything... a clue to finding Sasuke!

 Sasuke's Decision: Pushed to the Edge!
 There you are!
 I’m here!
 I’m returning them to you!
 So it’s a clone…
 Bastard!
 Sasuke…Uchiha…!
 Why won’t you come at me?!
 Why…
 do you flee?!
 Ready?
 Over here!
 Over here!
 Wait!
 Pass!
 Here! Good one!
 Good! Go! Go! Go!

 What’re we gonna do?
 We don’t know any wall-climbing techniques or anything…
 Y-You’re…
 This…
 It’s Gaara…
 Gaara of Sand…
 R-Run!
 Wait!
 Don’t leave me alone!
 Help me!
 I don't…
 want to be alone anymore!
 Really…
 No!
 Gaara! Please calm down!
 Yashamaru…
 No escape!
 I won’t let you escape! Sasuke Uchiha!
 You’ve gotta be kidding! What’s with that outrageous strength…?
 Are you afraid of me?
 It’s too overwhelming…
 Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid? Are you afraid of my existence?!
 Don’t forget… You are my prey.
 Wait!
 Why are you fixated on me so much?
 Those eyes that know true loneliness…
 And eyes that know that it is the world’s greatest suffering…
 I think I told you.
 That you have the same eyes as me.
 Eyes that lust for power,
 overflowing with hatred and murderous intent…
 The same as me…
 Eyes that burn to kill those who drove you…
 into a hell called loneliness!
 Such are your eyes.
 Okay. Just a minute.
 So you’re called Gaara…
 I don’t know what you know about Sasuke, but…
 It’s not good for you to speak as though
 you perceive everything about Sasuke!
 What is it that you want to say to him before the final round,
 by pursuing him so far?
 A battle is where…
 another’s existence and one’s own existence are put on the line…
 and each tries to kill the other!
 Only the winner can actually feel the value of his own existence.
 In other words, what you want to say is…
 let’s have a killing bout and not a match?
 Uchiha… You really should be wanting it, too…
 in the depths of your soul…
 You want to confirm the value of your existence.
 Am I really, truly powerful?
 Is my existence more powerful than my opponent
 who faces me with eyes filled with intent to kill?
 What’s the matter?!
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 Are you afraid of me?!
 Your hatred and intent to kill…
 have they given way to fear?
 Is that the extent of your existence?!
 Fight me…and confirm it!
 Your value! Your existence!
 Experience it!
 If you want an answer…
 Come at me!
 I was allowed to live…
 Only…myself.
 Expressly for what reason?!
 No… I know the reason.
 The reason that man left me alive was so he wouldn’t be tormented
 by a sense of guilt for having killed an entire clan…
 Itachi chose me as the avenger… in order to have me kill him!
 Now, let me have some fun… Sasuke Uchiha!
 I’ll finish it with one blow!
 Hurry up and die, release yourself from your misery.
 You silly old fool…
 I believe I told you… that you would die too!
 Bastard!
 Let go, you old fool!
 I will not let go! I refuse to let go…
 until I have pulled out your soul!
 At this rate…
 Gaara!
 Looks like it worked…
 I see! That’s what it was!
 That’s not possible…
 He countered Gaara’s attack in that condition?!
 I just realized the reason… why it’s so fun!
 This pain…
 To take down an opponent who wounded me…
 and thoroughly destroy him…!
 That will make me truly feel alive!
 Gaara’s never had a single wound, but he got Gaara twice.
 Is he…a freak?!
 No…a true freak is…
 After all, the only thing Gaara is transforming is still just his right arm.
 More, more!
 What?!
 What the heck is this guy?!
 One after another…
 Here goes!
 He’s even faster!
 I can’t dodge unless I read ahead of his movements.
 If I didn’t have these eyes I’d have died long ago.
 I can no longer use Chidori…
 Fire Style… Fire Ball Jutsu!
 So the Fire Style doesn’t work against sand…
 Not only that, this level of Jutsu won’t…
 Die!
 Apparently…it needs to be Chidori!
 Well! Your limit is two shots. That’s about it…
 This is as many Chidori you can shoot in one day
 with your present Chakra.
 After all, this Chidori is a technique that can only be used
 in conjunction with Sharingan during actual battles.
 But using Sharingan and another Jutsu simultaneously means
 exploding and using up the Chakra in your body all at once.
 Well! But you really are one of the more impressive ones.
 Even with my Chidori…
 If I use the Lightning Blade four times in a day,
 I’d completely use up my Chakra.
 What would happen if I tried to use more than two shots?
 The third shot won’t be activated…
 Remember this well!
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
 not only will the Jutsu not properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
 And in the worst case, you’ll die!
 Even if you were to survive, absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case.
 What's the matter?
 Does the value of your existence amount to only this much?
 I’ll be blunt…
 You are…weak!
 You’re too optimistic.
 And it’s because your hatred is weak!
 The power of hatred is the power of the intent to kill!
 The power of the intent to kill is the power of revenge!
 Your hatred is weaker than mine!
 Shut up…
 Do you understand the meaning of this?!
 Shut up!
 That means that you… You are weaker than me!
 Itachi chose me to be the avenger… to have me kill him!
 I am an avenger!
 The Curse Mark again…
 Darn…! My body…
 Sasuke!

 Hey Yashamaru, what does pain feel like?
 I don’t know because I’ve never been injured…
 I was wondering what it’s like.
 Could it be that I’m hurt?
 I’m not bleeding, but my chest’s felt weird for a long time.
 It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!

 His opponent is that Neji, huh…?
 The Final Round is altogether different than the preliminaries…
 After all, Naruto may not be able to…
 Entertain me a little, Naruto.
 I’ve got a tough job waiting for me now, so…
 Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!
 Dang it. I can’t catch him at all.
 I told you I’m not such a fool, didn’t I?
 I already know… which one is the real one.
 Oh.
 That is the body that has least attacks
 due to its fear of having Chakra Points attacked.
 The more you attack,
 the more that one body becomes clearly evident.
 You’re the real one.
 Naruto…
 This is as far as it goes.
 I said it was pointless.
 Don’t let him beat you, Naruto.
 I’ve been telling you not to frivolously assume things.
 What?
 It can’t be.
 All right! Go, Naruto!
 Naruto…!
 He foiled my idea and purposely and drew one of his clones back?
 I’ve been striking from the beginning, prepared for an honorable death!
 Believe it!
 I did it.
 That’s…
 W-What was that?
 Did you think you’d won?
 Why?
 Naruto’s punch should’ve hit.
 That…
 Rotation...
 That’s Neji’s defense.
 You punk. Don’t make a fool of me.
 The largest range of vision of Neji’s Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.
 And he detects all of his opponent’s attacks with the Byakugan.
 His defense technique, the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
 will begin from here.
 The moment he’s attacked, he discharges a large amount of Chakra
 from the Chakra holes in the body, blocks the enemy’s attack with that Chakra,
 moves his own body in a circular motion, dodges and repels.
 Essentially, it’s difficult to control the Chakra discharged from Chakra holes…
 To the extent that even Jonin utilize the discharge from a part of the body,
 like the hands and feet, in techniques.
 But Neji who has mastered Gentle Fist discharges Chakra
 from his entire body and shuts out physical attacks
 just with that discharge power.
 In other words,
 that’s one more absolute defense
 that has more power than that Gaara’s Sand Shield.
 T-That’s father’s…
 The Rotation is a secret Art passed down from generation to generation
 only to the Hyuga head family, in other words the Hyuga clan.
 He created that on his own…?
 He’s quite the guy… To think he’d come this far.
 It’s much too soon to be surprised. Neji’s true power is still to come.
 Dang it.
 This is the end.
 You’re within the area of my 8 Trigrams.
 Gentle Fist Art.
 8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
 It can’t be.
 That pose.
 8 Tetragrams…
 …2 Palms!
 4 Palms.
 8 Palms.
 16 Palms.
 32 Palms.
 64 Palms!
 The branch family exceeds the head family?
 It’s over.
 Truly a terrifying talent.
 To think the power of the Hyuga Kekkei Genkai
 would be passed on so strongly to a child of the branch family
 who would never be able to be an heir.
 Hizashi… You should have succeeded the Hyuga family.
 I pressed the 64 Chakra Points all over your body…
 You can’t even stand.
 D-Dang it.
 Are you frustrated?
 Kneeling down before power that can’t be changed
 and knowing your powerlessness.
 Your dreams will come true if you just work hard.
 That’s just an illusion.
 Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?
 Oh, man. I knew it.
 Naruto.
 Bushy brow…
 Hinata.
 D-Dang it.
 Oh.
 Naruto.
 He… No way.
 I told you, didn’t I…?
 I don’t know when to give up.
 No way.
 Hey, you’re bleeding.
 What’s wrong?
 You’ve still got damage from the match.
 Hinata… Hang in there.
 I’ll take a look at her.
 Who’re you?
 I’m not suspicious or anything.
 Stop already…
 It’ll be the same even if you fight more than this.
 I don’t have a grudge particularly against you.
 S-Shut up…
 Even if you say so, I have something against you.
 What are you talking about?
 Why…? Here you’re this strong…
 Why did you, with a look like you’ve seen through it all,
 go after Hinata mentally who was trying so hard?
 It has nothing to do with you.
 Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling her a failure as you please.
 Head family, branch family…
 I don’t know what happened to you.
 But I won’t forgive the jerk who’d call another person a failure.
 Hey, you.
 It’s okay. I’m a doctor.
 Okay… Fine.
 If you insist, I’ll tell you about the Hyuga’s destiny of hatred.
 In the Hyuga head family, there’s a secret Ninjutsu
 that’s been passed on from generation to generation.
 That is the Curse Mark Arts.
 Curse Mark Arts?
 The Curse Mark represents a bird in a cage…
 and it’s a mark of those who are bound to a destiny they can’t escape.
 W-What’s…
 ...t-that mark?
 One day when I was four years old,
 this accursed mark was inscribed on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.
 A large ceremony was held in the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.
 It was also the day when the head Ninja of the Land of Lightning,
 the land that the Leaf had fought with for many years,
 came for the conclusion of the allied treaty.
 However, there was one clan…
 who didn’t attend the ceremony that was attended
 by everybody else, from Leaf Jonin to Genin.
 It was the Hyuga clan…
 And it’s because that day was the day of hope
 when the head family heir was to turn three.
 Miss Hinata’s third birthday!
 My father, Hizashi Hyuga,
 and Miss Hinata’s father who’s over there, Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.
 However, Miss Hinata’s father, Lord Hiashi,
 is the eldest son of the head family born into this world first.
 And my father who was the second son is a member of the branch family.
 So Miss Hinata is already three…
 Congratulations.
 Thank you.
 She’s a cute girl, isn’t she, father?
 What’s wrong, father?
 Oh, it’s nothing.
 Then…
 I’ll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.
 Yes.
 When the head family heir grew and became three years old,
 I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me and I became the bird in the cage.
 And became the Hyuga branch family.
 Why’s it necessary to do something like that?
 Why separate into a head family and a branch family?
 What does that weird mark mean?
 This mark on my forehead isn’t just a decoration.
 The pull of your legs is weak.
 Yes.
 Listen, Neji.
 You will live to protect Miss Hinata of the head family
 as well as the Hyuga power.
 Yes, father.
 Murderous Intent.
 My head.
 Father.
 What’s wrong, father?
 Go home. I’ll forgive the fool today only.
 You’re not to forget your destiny.
 This Curse Mark is the absolute fear called death so to speak…
 that was given to the branch family by the head family.
 The Secret Sign that the head family members form easily
 destroys the cerebral nerves of those in the branch family.
 Of course, killing is easy.
 And this mark only goes away at time of death.
 Sealing away the power of the Byakugan.
 The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses the most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.
 There’s no end to those who target the secret of that distinctive power.
 In other words, this Curse Mark keeps the branch family alive
 only to protect the head family and does not allow disobedience.
 And it’s an effective system created to defend for eternity
 the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.
 And then, that incident occurred.
 My father was killed by the head family.
 One night, Miss Hinata was snatched up by someone.
 At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately rushed off and killed the abductor.
 Who do you think that person was…
 who was in the shadows, and also wearing a mask?
 It was the head ninja of the Land of Lightning
 who had just completed the allied treaty.
 It was clear that he came targeting the secret of Byakugan from the start.
 However, the Land of Lightning exploited the killing of their own Ninja
 due to a botched plan…
 and set an outrageous condition in violation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.
 Naturally, things got worse and worse,
 and there was almost a war between the Leaf and the Lightning.
 However, the Leaf who wanted to avoid war
 made a deal with the Lightning.
 A deal?
 The Lightning demand was the body of the Hyuga head family
 who possesses Byakugan, the Kekkei Genkai…
 In other words, the body of Lord Hiashi.
 And the Leaf accepted the condition.
 What? But, father…
 And war was safely avoided.
 Thanks to my father who was killed as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,
 to protect the head family!
 Other than dying, there’s no other way to escape this accursed Curse Mark.
 Even though they were twins with nearly equal power,
 their destinies were already set by who was born first and born later.
 And then, this match…
 Your destiny was decided at the point when I became your opponent.
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Are all my Chakra Points really closed?
 Darn. I cannot feel any Chakra remaining in my body at all…
 just like when I used up all my Chakra in my training with the Pervy Sage.
 Wait. I got it. Just watch me!
 I will squeeze out my Chakra no matter what!

 Kakashi!
 How is Naruto Uzumaki’s condition?
 He’s okay.
 What about Sasuke? Where’s Sasuke Uchiha?!
 How are the other Genin?
 Yes! By Lady Hokage’s order,
 the first and second medical corps have been dispatched…
 The wounded from all areas have already been gathered.
 They were convoyed after administering emergency treatment.
 How are their conditions?
 Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries…
 Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries, but it’s not life-threatening.
 Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi are in serious condition…
 At this point, there’s no telling what will happen.
 Everyone…
 The ingredients and effects of the medicine
 have been thoroughly researched.
 Excellent…
 Now bring the deer antler!
 Yes, ma’am!
 How is he…Big Sister?
 No walks for him for quite a while…
 The muscles of his limbs have been severely damaged.
 You’re a vet, right, Big Sister? Can’t you somehow…?
 It’ll be okay.
 It’ll take time. But there’s no threat to his life, so rest easy.
 Walks for you are out of the question for quite a while, too!

 As for the Chakra control, handle it as if we’re threading a needle!
 Understood!
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 There’s no point in you getting frustrated, right?
 Missions come with sacrifice…
 You took the mental training, right?
 Training and actual battle are different, you know…
 I know what missions are about…
 And I thought I knew what the Shinobi world is like.
 I became a platoon leader for the first time on this mission.
 With that, I understood…
 I’m not cut out to be a Shinobi.
 Surprisingly fragile…for a man.
 This time…
 The only thing I was able to do as platoon leader…
 was to believe in everyone.
 I was naïve…
 I didn’t have enough power…
 It’s all my fault!
 Are you afraid of getting hurt?
 Shikamaru…
 Are you going to be argued down by a girl and run away?
 It’s a drag…
 I don’t want to have arguments. I’m not a woman.
 Yeah… But you’re not a man, either.
 You’re just a coward!
 Even if you quit being Shinobi, the missions will continue.
 Someone has to do it.
 Your comrades will just be dispatched again…
 under a different platoon leader.
 And your comrades might die there.
 But if at that time, you were the platoon leader…
 your comrades might be saved from that happening to them.
 If you reflect on this time, make use of the experience and learn,
 you might be able to carry out missions with more perfection.
 If you really think your comrades are important to you,
 before you think about running away…
 think about becoming more exceptional for the sake of your comrades!
 That’s what real comrades are, you coward!

 caused by the side effects of the Pills.

 But, everyone is alive! That’s the most important thing.
 Next time for sure…
 I’ll carry out the mission perfectly!

 If you don’t want to die, use more care in how you talk.
 Wh-What? This quality of Chakra…
 Yes… My future is inside this kid…
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 I’m going to where Orochimaru is!
 Please…bring back Sasuke!
 I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail! I promise that on my life!
 Oh…You were awake, huh?
 Shikamaru!
 I’m going on ahead to Choji! What about you?
 I’m going on ahead to… Naruto and Sasuke!
 I see… So everyone’s okay. That’s good.
 Then, Sasuke…
 Yeah…he's gone.
 Intensive Care Unit 6
 Then, I still can’t see him…?
 Yeah… But Lady Tsunade said that he should regain consciousness soon.
 Thank goodness…
 It’s really a great help that
 Lady Tsunade returned to the Leaf Village.
 If she hadn’t, right about now, Choji would be…
 The Lady Fifth…Hokage.
 You’ve come to visit?
 Information sure travels fast.
 Sakura…
 Naruto…
 I heard you suffered quite a serious injury…
 But you look well, considering.
 I’m sorry… Sakura…
 Why do you apologize?
 Being you, you probably got reckless again, right?!
 Jeez, you look like a mummy…
 I’m sorry… I…
 Hey… The weather’s nice today. So open the curtains.
 Sakura! I…
 I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
 I promised on my life. That’s what I said, so I…!
 It’s okay already, Naruto…
 Sakura! He…
 I always…
 said that, so… I…
 I stick straight to what I say!
 That’s my Way of Ninja!
 Naruto…
 Thanks, Naruto…
 I’ll get right to healing this injury and I’ve got to bring Sasuke back!
 Wh-What was that?!
 Per…Pervy Sage?!
 Yo!
 I’ve come today to tell you something important.
 From here on, as my official disciple,
 I’ll train you to become a full-fledged Shinobi in three years.
 Three years…?
 I’ve received some credible information from a certain source
 concerning the “Akatsuki.”
 Akatsuki…
 It seems that it will be three or four years
 before they come after you next.
 I don’t care about that!
 Talking about stuff that’s so far down the road…
 I don’t have the time to be doing slowpoke training!
 What do you mean?
 If I don’t go after Sasuke immediately,
 he might be killed by Orochimaru!
 “Immortal” doesn’t mean that the flesh is being maintained as is.
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be made into a vessel for his soul.
 It seems you’ve learned of the true purpose
 for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke…
 Huh?! Then that means you also knew…?
 I was looking into Orochimaru’s Immortality Jutsu.
 It seems with that Jutsu,
 he can’t reincarnate into the next body for three years.
 And unable to wait for Sasuke, he just recently reincarnated…
 It’ll be okay for three years from now… There is time.
 That’s not a lie, is it?!
 Not a lie, is it?!
 Nope…
 However…
 Forget about Sasuke…
 Sasuke went to Orochimaru on his own accord.
 No matter what you do, he won’t change.
 I’ve seen many Shinobi, so I know…
 Sasuke is the same kind as Orochimaru.
 If you’re thinking about bringing him back, just forget it.
 That’s something an arrogant fool would do!
 He may be nothing to you but he’s my friend!
 Would a friend hurt his comrade?!
 Take a look at your current plight!
 This is…!
 Why? Why would you…?
 We were called Sannin together…
 Weren’t we comrades since we were kids?!
 In every regard, you’re a foolish guy, Jiraiya…
 You lack thought in everything you do.
 That’s why you didn’t notice what I was doing.
 Can’t you rethink it, Orochimaru?
 Absurd!
 How can you be so stupid?!
 No matter how much I wanted it…
 in the end, there was no way he would come back.
 After the agony, all that’s left was my own powerlessness and regret.
 I don’t want you to go through the same thing…
 If you’re going to go after Sasuke, then there’ll be no training.
 I’ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you
 and depending on the case, prohibit you from leaving the village.
 You’re not just an ordinary kid…
 You possess the Nine Tail Fox that the Akatsuki is after!
 This is serious. I'll just have to do that…
 if you’re going to act on your own without listening to what I say.
 Eventually, you’re going to have to deal
 with guys more troublesome than Orochimaru.
 Give up on Sasuke.
 Sooner or later this was going to happen.
 Don’t suffer anymore! Forget and dismiss him.
 It’s not just Jutsu or power…
 If you’re a Shinobi, develop eyes that can make the right judgment.
 And if you’re going to live as a Shinobi, become wise.
 If you remain a fool…
 the reality is that it will be tough living in this world.
 Fine.
 If that’s what being wise is…
 Then I’m fine being a fool for life!
 Even if by myself,
 I’ll create even more awesome Jutsu and save Sasuke no matter what!
 And, and, I’ll even kick the Akatsuki’s butt!
 If someone like you were to do it alone…
 the best you’d be able to come up with
 would be some stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.
 It might somehow work out
 if you are a big fool and not an ordinary fool…
 Be prepared once you’re out of the hospital,
 you big fool.
 See you then.
 Roger!
 – It’s been seven years since… – …all the members gathered like this.
 Since Orochimaru left the organization.
 That Orochimaru has gotten the Sharingan.
 Itachi…Your little brother?
 Don’t get hasty. Yeah.
 We’ll kill Orochimaru eventually…
 More importantly, there are only three years left.
 Can everyone accomplish the work required of them?
 Huh?
 Yes, our goal is…
 to get everything, including the Nine Tail Fox in question!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Sakura’s been weird all along ever since Sasuke left.
 I can’t put it well,
 but she’s gloomy or fretting or something.
 On top of that she says, “This time I’ll do my best on my own.”
 What the heck does that mean?
 It’s bugging me, it’s bugging me!
 This isn’t the time for me to be relaxing in the hospital!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,

 You’re not old enough

 Plea from a Friend
 That's Naruto?
 What is this intimidating power?
 And what was that red Chakra earlier on?
 Is this guy a monster?
 What the heck are you?!
 Your friend!
 That’s why I’m telling you
 I’m not gonna let the likes of Orochimaru get you!
 I’m telling you that I’ll stop you…
 even if it means breaking every bone in your arm and legs!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Come on! Wake up, already!
 If you don’t come to your senses, I'll have to break your bones
 so that you can’t move and I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!
 Shut up…
 What the heck do you,
 who has neither parents nor brothers, think you understand?
 What makes you think that you, who's been all alone from the start,
 can understand anything about me?!
 It’s because I have the ties that I feel this agony.
 How could you possibly understand…
 what it feels like to lose all that!
 It’s true that I can’t understand…
 how it feels to really have parents or brothers…
 However…
 It’s my treat today… Eat your fill!
 Yippee!
 When I’m with Iruka Sensei, I imagine…
 – Dig in! 					– Dig in!
 Ninja, first of all, need to warm their inner man.
 Hey! Hey! Don’t get too carried away and overeat!
 If this is… what it feels like to have a dad.
 When I’m with you…
 Idiot, idiot, idiot…
 What was that, you loser?!
 I’m not gonna lose to you, no matter what!
 Go ahead and say whatever you want.
 How about this?
 Better not start feeling too comfortable.
 I wonder…if having a brother feels something like that.
 Why is it, Naruto…?
 Why is it that you go to this extent for me…?
 For me it’s a tie that I’ve finally been able to have!
 That’s why I’m gonna stop you.
 It’s too late, Naruto… lt’s already too late.
 I can’t go back anymore.
 Come, Naruto!
 In that case, I just have to cut that tie.
 Cut, huh?
 Then why wear that headband now?
 I’ll acknowledge you… You’re strong.
 And the reason for that is
 you’re someone who knows the pain of solitude as I do.
 And that pain makes people stronger.
 And for that very reason, by cutting that tie,
 I will be able to obtain even greater strength.
 I will fight you now on equal terms. However…
 You won't even be able to inflict a scratch on my forehead.
 That’s something that won’t change in the least.
 It seems that whatever I say won’t have any effect anymore, huh?
 Sasuke!
 I’m done with talking…
 From here on, it’s only fighting.
 Come!
 I’m able to see…
 I’m now able to see this guy’s movements…
 which I wasn’t able to see before.
 I’m able to see them!
 Sasuke’s moving completely different from a few moments ago.
 But I couldn’t care less!
 In any case, I can’t afford to lose!
 Damn it!
 It must be the influence of my body getting used to the state of Curse Mark.
 When he moves…
 by the subtle movements in the way he exerts his strength…
 I can vividly see an image of his next move.
 With my level of “eyes,”
 I don’t need to use unnecessary Chakra and can instead preserve it.
 The Curse Mark takes too much Chakra.
 If I can see this much…
 I can time my attacks to the images of Naruto’s movements as I foresee them.
 This is no good…
 He’s totally reading my movements.
 Damn it!
 Oh, there you are.
 There’s no mistake it’s this way, right?
 Right.
 We better hurry. I have a bad premonition.
 Sasuke!
 Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!
 Sa-su-ke…
 It’s too late, Naruto.
 It’s too late now! Naruto!
 You're weak, aren’t you, kid?
 You better be grateful to me…
 and to the Fourth Hokage
 who contained me within the likes of you!
 What’s going on?
 What was that just now?
 Even if I’m able to read Naruto’s movements completely…
 his Chakra makes a separate move of its own.
 It seems like the Chakra itself is moving in accordance with its own will…
 Even with my “eyes” I’m unable to read it completely.
 That red Chakra… that’s not an ordinary Chakra!
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
 placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 I see…
 It appears that you have some kind of special power.
 Now I understand!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 That Chakra is protecting him?!
 Calm down.
 I won’t be caught as long as I fight from distance.
 Damn it… This is incredible!
 All I can do is dodge…
 Please let me get there in time.
 Damn it, gimme a break…
 If I get tainted by this power …
 I don’t even know what will happen to me in the end…
 But, it can’t be helped, can it, Naruto?
 It is certainly true that you were special…
 However…
 I am even more special than you.
 Sasuke!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Damn! My body hurts!
 And to make it worse,
 I’ve completely lost feeling in my left arm!
 Apparently this power isn’t something that
 I can just keep on using continuously!
 But …I can’t give up!
 My next blow is going to be the end!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning

 U-!
 Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
 Naruto Barrage!
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m…getting stronger!
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one! You did it!
 T-That Naruto beat Kiba!
 It’s a major upset…
 Yup!
 Yes!
 Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
 This medicine works really well!
 Here! Do you want to use it too, Sakura?
 Only your wounds heal with such speed…Naruto.
 The power of Nine Tail never cease to amaze me.
 U-Umm...
 T-This is…
 ointment for your wound,
 for you Kiba and Akamaru.
 Rather than worrying about others,
 it’s about time you worried about yourself!
 Kiba…
 There are only 6 people left…
 you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy, and the Sand guy.
 Listen, Hinata…
 If you pull that guy from Sand, withdraw quickly.
 And there’s one more…
 Do the same if you get Neji, too.
 Withdraw quickly…
 That guy will be hard on you.
 He will destroy you.
 Well, let’s announce the next match.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 – What? 					– Huh?
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Hinata…
 This is going to be an interesting match…
 I never thought that I would have a fight with you…
 Lady Hinata.
 Brother Neji…
 Brother?
 Huh?!
 Those two are siblings?
 They’re descended from
 one of the most honorable old families in the Hidden Leaf…
 The Hyuga Clan.
 But, they’re not siblings.
 Then, how are they related?
 Well, the relation of a head family and branch family…
 That may be an appropriate way to say it.
 Head family and branch family?
 Yes!
 Hinata is from the head family.
 In other words, a person from the main household
 and Neji is from a branch family that is descended from that family.
 In other words, it’s a fight between relatives.
 It must be uneasy for both of them…
 Yes.
 However…
 Huh? What is it?
 I’ve heard that from long ago,
 there’ve been various incidents between the head family and branch family,
 and now their relationship isn’t on very good terms.
 Hmmm.
 Why?
 I don’t know the details either.
 Only…
 The so-called distinguished Ninja clans like Uchiha and Hyuga
 have special techniques and abilities that run in the family.
 It seems that the Hyuga household laid down rules
 for communicating those techniques…
 It seems that there are many rules that favor the head family…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 And there have been various incidents
 between the head family and branch family due to those rules.
 So this is a confrontation billed as a clash of fate…
 Oh, it’s gonna begin.
 Start the battle please!
 Just one thing before we square off against each other in the fight…
 I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
 Withdraw!
 You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.
 You’re too nice.
 You wish for harmony and avoid conflict,
 you’re open to going with the thinking of others.
 And, you have no confidence in yourself.
 You’re always feeling inferior…
 You thought it’s a good idea to stay Genin.
 However, you can’t register for the Chunin test without three members…
 So you couldn’t turn down when Kiba and the other proposed it and,
 the truth is, you entered the exam reluctantly.
 Is that wrong?!
 T-That’s wrong…
 That’s not true…
 I…
 I only…
 I wanted to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Hinata…
 Stand up, Hanabi!
 From now on, I’ll keep Hinata under my wing…
 But is that really okay?
 Hinata should be the heir to the Hyuga clan…
 But, there is always death involved with the job of Genin.
 Do what you want.
 She’s a failure who’s inferior even to her younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
 We don’t need her here in Hyuga clan…
 Is that all you have to say?
 If so, leave!
 You’re in the way!
 Yes.
 Hinata is trying to change herself in her own way.
 Lady Hinata…
 You are a spoiled one of the head family.
 People can never change!
 A failure will always be a failure…
 That personality and strength won’t change.
 That guy…
 Since people don’t change, differences exist among them…
 and expressions like “elite” and “failure” are born.
 Everyone judges and are judged
 based on the value of their face and brain, ability and body type,
 good and bad points of their personalities.
 People have to suffer and live
 within the means of the elements they cannot change.
 Just like the fact that I’m from a branch family
 and you’re from the head family,
 these things can’t change.
 I’ve seen everything with this Byakugan.
 That’s why I understand!
 You’re just talking tough.
 You’re really thinking that you’d like to run away from this place…
 T-That’s wrong…
 I really…
 Byakugan?
 It’s said that if you trace the Uchiha Clan’s history,
 the clan’s ability has its source in Hyuga clan.
 The Byakugan is one of the Hyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai,
 a Visual Jutsu similar to Sharingan…
 However, with the ability of insight alone…
 it gets the better of Sharingan.
 Byakugan!
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 My eyes can’t be deceived.
 Just now from my pressure,
 your line of sight was pushed to the upper left.
 This is the sign that you're recalling your past experience…
 your bitter past.
 And soon after that, your line of sight moved to the bottom right…
 This is the sign that you're imagining physical and mental suffering.
 That means…
 you’re picturing your old self,
 and from all of your experiences up until now,
 you’re imagining the result of this battle…
 The image of you losing!
 Even the act of propping your arms in front of your body…
 It’s a gesture that means
 you want to build a wall between us and keep distant.
 And that reflects your mind...
 that you don’t want any more of your deepest feelings to be raided…
 Because everything I’ve said is right on the mark, right?
 Furthermore…
 Laying a finger on your lips,
 that too, is a self-familiarizing act which represents a sense of panic.
 It represents a defense instinct--
 you want to alleviate the tension and unease.
 In other words…
 deep in your heart, you know it’s true, don’t you?
 Changing yourself, is something you absolutely can’t--!
 Sure, she can!
 You don’t have the privilege of deciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Give it to him, Hinata!
 Naruto…
 Hinata!
 Don’t just take it! Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto…
 What an annoying guy!
 Naruto…
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyes has changed…
 So you’re not going to withdraw?
 I ‘m not taking responsibility for what happens!
 I…
 I won’t run away!
 I don’t…
 I don’t change my words…
 That’s my Way of Ninja!
 ...want to run anymore!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji!
 I challenge you!
 T-That is…
 Fine…
 Of course, the same Hyuga style…
 Her pose is very similar to Neji’s.
 Hyuga style?
 The strongest Taijutsu style in the Village Hidden in the Leaf…
 Huh?
 I said it before...
 The man who is most likely
 the strongest Genin of Hidden Leaf Village is on my team…
 That’s…
 That guy, Neji Hyuga.
 Here!
 Did it go in?!
 No…it was shallow!
 No. Even a graze works.
 That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan
 is called the Hidden Leaf’s distinguished family.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 The Hyuga has a particular Taijutsu passed down through generations.
 It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu that Lee and I are good at…
 Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
 is mainly to inflict external damage on our enemy,
 like broken bones and surface wounds.
 In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsu inflict damage
 on the Chakra Network through which Chakra flow through the body,
 and damaging the insides, namely, it destroys internal organs.
 They possess the Gentle Fist.
 It’s not spectacular to watch…
 but later it slowly takes effect.
 Well, you can’t train the internal organs…
 Even if you were really robust,
 one hit from it would be a deadly blow…
 Even I can…
 Hinata’s on the offensive…
 Hinata…
 Way to go, Hinata!
 To attack the Chakra Network…
 What are they, those people…?
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Chakra Network, what’s that?!
 Here we go again…
 a question from a stupid guy.
 I’ll explain.
 They’re like blood canals.
 In the same way that blood flows through vessels throughout the body,
 They’re bundles of canals that take Chakra’s into every corner of your body…
 Oh!
 Like a path for Chakras, huh?
 Yes…
 Furthermore, the Chakra Network is closely connected
 with the internal organs which enfold Chakra within the body.
 That’s why if the Chakra Network is attacked
 the internal organs also suffer damage.
 Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya?
 Hey you! That's no way to talk to your senior!
 It’s no wonder…
 Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy.
 That’s…
 him.
 Sensei…
 But, how can they do that?
 After all, the Chakra Network isn’t visible to the eyes.
 How do they attack the Chakra line inside the body?
 No.
 The eyes of those two…
 They can see it with their Byakugan.
 And a Gentle Fist attack is a little different from a regular attack.
 They release their own Chakra
 from a Chakra opening in their hand and screw it into their opponent’s body.
 It directly inflicts damage on your enemy’s Chakra Network.
 All right!
 Has she done it?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Amazing!
 That Hinata!
 She’s always melancholy and wishy-washy and…
 I thought she is kinda weird, yet…
 Even when she gets blow after blow, she gets back up and goes.
 There’s something about her way of fighting.
 Just a feeling, but she resembles you, I think.
 Resembles me? Hinata resembles me?
 Now that I think about it, that girl, she was always watching you.
 Huh?

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Dark Creeping Clouds
 Come…come…come…
 The villagers are welcoming us.
 Everyone seems to be safe.
 It seems like the Kurosuki Family ran away in fear.
 Hey…
 Here they come!
 Naruto! Don’t come…
 If you value your life, be quiet.
 Karashi…
 I heard that you were deeply sorry for your actions…!
 How could I shamelessly run back to the curry house?!
 Now!
 Did you see that?!
 Although Master Raiga is not around, the Kurosuki Family is eternal!
 Hey…what are you looking for?
 Isn’t it obvious? The brats!
 Are you referring to us?
 What?!
 What you crushed were our forms
 made by the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu.
 Take formation!

 Gosh, you never learn, do you!
 Karashi, are you prepared?
 I was just kidding!
 How dare you torment us!
 You really think we’ll let this slide as a joke?
 I couldn’t help it! If I didn’t listen,
 I would have gotten killed by the Kurosuki family.
 In place of the Kurosuki family,
 I’ll crack your head with this hammer!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 I’m sorry…
 Please move, Lee!
 Please hit me until you guys are satisfied.
 Why you?
 It’s partly my responsibility
 that the once kind-hearted Karashi went and joined a gang.
 Yours?
 Because of me,
 he got the impression that power is everything.
 Right, that’s right!
 Though I knew that it’s a bad thing, I just had to…
 You be quiet!
 Karashi is still inexperienced.
 But he has skills to make curry that can save people’s lives.
 Please give Karashi the opportunity to make amends by making curry.
 If Karashi goes astray again, then I will…!
 Punish him with my fists!
 Everyone, what do you think
 about letting Lee and Grandma Sansho take care of this situation…
 After all, he was just an underling of the Kurosuki family.
 It’s not like he directly attacked us or anything…
 Let’s have Lee educate him harshly…
 In that case…
 Thank you very much!
 Th-Thank you…
 And with this, our mission is complete.
 No, not yet…
 Huh?
 Are you all right?
 What’s the point of being all right?
 I can’t live alone.
 Don’t say that!
 Why don’t we just leave this weakling!
 Everyone has to live alone!
 But don’t you need friends who can help you and stuff…?
 I’m talking about some basics! I hate people who are indecisive!
 I was frail from the time I was born.
 That shabby cabin was the entire world for me.
 I have no memory of my parents…
 I survived only by the small amount of food
 that the villagers sometimes brought me…
 But even someone like me had a power that no one else did.
 Here you go.
 Thank you…
 Is your leg okay? The one you cut with the scythe?
 D-Did I tell you that story?!
 No…I kind of found out…
 How? No one else besides me came today or yesterday, right?
 No, I just saw it from here…
 Scary!
 As time went by everyone began to fear me since I had the power
 to know what was happening outside even from my room.
 Did you know?!
 I heard that Ranmaru has the ability to see everything…
 Were we being spied on every day?
 Get out of the village!
 You monster!
 And so I had no more visitors…
 All I could do was to wait to die.
 That’s when Raiga saved me…
 I see. What a bitter past.
 Yes, it is.
 Hmm…
 Raiga took me out to the unknown world.
 Ranmaru, try opening your eyes…
 This is the outside world where we’ll be living from now on…okay?
 Okay…
 If Raiga isn’t here, it’s the same as losing my body. 131.01	01:36:52:09	01:36:54:13	Perhaps Raiga became known
 as one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist
 because he was able to borrow your power.
 It seems like you two helped each other to live…
 Yes.
 That’s not true!
 You were being used for Raiga’s evil deeds!
 I might have been…used…
 But good or bad doesn’t matter to me. I’m just a sense organ…
 Then that won’t mean that you’re really living!
 Huh?
 See, you have to do your best to live from now on!
 Firstly, eat the curry of life and cheer up!
 That’s right! You will get nourishment.
 That will hurt the body instead, wouldn’t it?
 Naruto, you can’t eat it either, right?
 Actually, the more I eat it,
 the more energized my body feels…
 That curry saved my life, you know!
 Until the day you’re able to walk alone,
 I will become your body!
 Okay?
 I have one favor to ask…
 Huh…?
 Byakugan!
 As I expected… I can no longer see life in Raiga.
 Can you see, Ranmaru?
 Yes.
 Is this okay?
 Yes…
 Let’s go… Mission is complete.
 Hey!
 What?
 That is--!
 One, two, one, two.
 Grandma Sansho!
 What’s all this ruckus?! Dust will go into the curry.
 L-Lee and the others came back!
 K-Karashi is with them!
 Is it worth the ruckus?
 Grandma, aren’t you happy?
 One, two… One, two…
 Your snot will go in!
 Grandma Sansho! I’m back!
 Karashi is here too!
 M-Mom, sorry! Please forgive me!
 Please forgive him…
 He says he’ll devote himself from now on,
 and train to take over the Curry of Life Shop, so please…
 First you gotta eat…
 Huh…
 Wow, it looks good!
 If you’re not going to eat, I will!
 I’ve prepared some for each of you…
 Oh my, that’s a very pale child.
 Yeah, can you prepare some for him too?
 Especially mild…
 I prefer mild too…
 Oh my…
 Mom…thanks for the food!
 It’s a punishment times 300 curry…
 It’s spicy, it’s spicy…
 But it’s good! It’s good, Mom!
 Here, I have some for everybody!
 It’s okay, it’s mild.
 By the way, you were part of
 the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist with Raiga, right?
 Do you know a guy named Zabuza?
 Zabuza…you say?
 Uh then…
 How about a guy with this huge sword wrapped with something like a bandage
 and has fish eyes?
 Oh…that’s Kisame…
 Yeah Kisame!
 So, do you know what he’s up to right now?
 No… I heard that he slipped out from the Mist Village.
 I know his face, but I don’t know anything beyond that.
 I see…
 Should I ask Grandma to make you something else?
 No, I don’t need it… I don’t want to eat anything.
 Thank you for your help…
 Thank you very much.
 Make a good village with everyone!
 Um…where is Lee?
 His mission still isn’t complete.
 Please wait, Lee… I’m gonna die!
 Okay, let’s take a break here!
 Let’s do 300 push ups.
 What?!
 One, two…One, two…
 300…all right.
 It looks like… there’s going to be a storm.
 Even if a real storm comes,
 it should be fine if we reinforce it with these big trees!
 Oh my, thanks for doing this.
 No, it’s our thanks for the curry.
 Uh-uuh.
 But compared to you guys, my Karashi is…
 Tenten? I’m worried about Karashi and Ranmaru
 whom we left behind at the curry shop.
 We’re okay, so could you check on them there?
 Karashi?!
 Hey…
 Is the Boss really still alive?
 That Neji person didn’t seem to sense it then…
 But I know.
 Raiga…
 Oh…
 You were everything to me!
 I was only waiting to die…
 when you told me that we’ll live on together!
 To me, being with you, was living…
 I won’t hold a funeral for you either.
 Even if it costs me my life, I won’t let you die!
 Ranmaru!
 Did you die, Ranmaru?!
 Karashi…?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 What?! Tenten fell off the cliff?!
 Then we gotta go save her right away!
 Please calm down! Naruto!
 Tenten can’t be that clumsy.
 Huh? But that’s what Karashi said.
 Unfortunately, this might be some kind of trap.
 What? Trap?
 Karashi…
 Well, didn’t they get annihilated?

30,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 The smell is moving away…
 I’m saved…
 Who is?
 Please wait!
 The real deal…starts now!
 My role now is to stall this person as long as possible…
 so, I should’ve avoided big techniques that could be self-defeating…
 But it seems this isn’t an opponent easy enough to beat
 without using my Secret Technique…
 Here I go!
 I just had surgery and am not at my best…
 But if it’d just be opening the first of the Eight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,
 I should somehow…
 The first gate… The Gate of Opening…
 Open!
 Primary Lotus!
 The impact of the kick was suppressed by the bones…?!
 That’s some speed… But it’s over.
 Damn it… No matter how much I think, I can’t come up with any good strategies…!
 I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…
 With me right in front of you, you can’t even howl like a loser…?
 Huh?!
 Die!
 You’re mine!
 Don’t you be smiling before you’re going to die!
 What?!
 Who’re you?!
 It seems you’re an ally this time…
 Who’re you?!
 A Sand…
 Shinobi…
 ally of the Leaf!
 The Sand Shinobi: Allies of the Leaf
 The Sand…?! Am I still drunk…?
 Gaara of the Desert…
 Gaara.
 Is that who you are?
 Digital Shrapnel!
 Did he blow the finger tip bones…?!
 Impetuous…
 You…
 When you fought me… you had more speed and sharpness.
 Easy to say…
 It’s not that I’m holding a grudge…
 But on account of you, I had kind of a tough time of it.
 I see…
 But…why you…?
 I owe a lot…
 to the Leaf.
 Sasuke!
 I heard that we’d made up with the Sand traitors…
 But to think you’d change this abruptly…
 It’s not like we attacked the Leaf for the fun of it…
 It was an order…
 In the same way that I’m here now.
 I see. The Fifth Hokage asked the Sand…
 It’s a big help.
 By the way… has your sharpness gotten worse?
 Huh?
 Are you going to give up again or something?
 This time, I’ll do it for you!
 Sorry, but I can’t give up.
 A man mustn’t be protected by a woman, so…
 As usual, you’re a guy who’s annoying with the man-and-woman stuff.
 Even if you act tough, it’s totally obvious that it’s bravado, you idiot!
 This time you’re taking sides with the Leaf, huh?!
 You guys sure are busy all over the place!
 She uses Genjutsu with the sound of her flute.
 Right!
 Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!
 Blowing away the sounds of the flute
 and being able to nail the opponent with a physical attack.
 To think she can attack and defend with one hand…
 Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.
 That woman’s a natural enemy to me!
 Has Ukon…just about caught him according to the strategy?
 Puppet, huh…?
 You three had been approaching together, right?
 Two went on ahead.
 You guys are weak, so…
 You idiot… These guys are out of the ordinary!
 Behind you!
 I can’t…move.
 What’s this guy?
 I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!
 Where’s the other one?
 Hey! Who are you looking for?
 That state… I know!
 Be careful! They enter the body and start to fuse!
 It’s too late.
 This guy!
 What’s the matter, Sakon?!
 It seems like…
 your Jutsu didn’t work… on the puppet.
 This is a puppet, too?!
 Let me tell you this.
 We, the Sand Ninja, aren’t as lax as the Leaf.
 Moreover, don’t be carelessly approaching…
 the Black Ant!
 He was fearsome when he was an enemy...
 But to think he’d be this dependable when becoming an ally.
 Ow… I got careless. Let me rest in your body for a bit.
 Good-for-nothing guy…
 Who are these guys?
 This is their ability!
 Although you were caught off guard…
 you getting hammered by that puppet play…
 Well…
 Its power and speed are nothing special.
 I won’t be beaten by the likes of such a toy.
 And I was able to heal my belly wound.
 I don’t have much Chakra left… but well,
 these are opponents I should be able to tear apart, nevertheless.
 Indeed, it seems he’s healed. What a recovery ability he’s got.
 Ordinarily, I’m not the one who becomes the main body,
 so it’s hard to move, damn it.
 You sure are mocking us…
 He’s not an opponent you can beat fighting head on!
 We should retreat for now and…
 We can’t back down after having been mocked, you know.
 Don’t mess with me!
 The Black Ant isn’t a Mechanism for attacking.
 Primarily, it’s just for capturing.
 And…Crow paired up with the Black Ant is exclusively for attacking.
 Hey you! Let me out!
 Eat this!
 Puppet Show…
 Hey, let me out! Let me out!
 Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!
 The play is over.
 She hid, huh…?
 Or did she run away?
 No…That couldn’t be…
 I just got here.
 Briefly explain the present situation
 including an analysis of her ability and battle style.
 First off, her fundamental tactic is ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu
 with the sound of her flute.
 And then she delivers physical attacks to that opening.
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?
 I can’t move my body…!
 I believe this was your last hand, right?
 Unfortunately… this is reversed checkmate!
 You little rat!
 She’s a classic Genjutsu-style distance range type.
 Most likely, she must’ve seen your Jutsu and figured out immediately
 that it wouldn’t mix well with her own Jutsu.
 And it’s two against one, too.
 She’ll never appear before us again until she casts her Genjutsu.
 Sound, huh…?
 Yeah…
 Genjutsu generally appeal to the five senses of people…
 sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.
 The type that uses hearing is the most troublesome of them all.
 After she cleverly takes a distance on you and then hides…
 you have no idea where the Genjutsu will be cast from or when.
 The idea is for us to already be cast by the Genjutsu
 by the time we’ve figured out where she is by the sound of the flute…
 Ouch…
 In my opinion, we’re at an overwhelming disadvantage.
 A battle with this type, essentially, wouldn’t even be worth talking about
 without sensor types like Kiba or Neji.
 At this rate, we’ll get pushed into a corner sooner or later.
 – We should just retreat… – Who asked for your opinion?!
 I told you to just explain the situation.
 Don’t misjudge my power…
 If she thinks she’s hiding well from me…
 in a distance enough for the sound of her flute to reach…
 she’s naïve!
 Summoning: Blade Dance
 Cut!
 All right…
 I’ve made it this far. lt’s about time for my Genjutsu…
 Huh?
 How about it?
 It’s done.
 She’s sure…pushy.
 She’s scarier than my mom.
 Pretty good, huh?
 But well…
 I just have to be grateful for this time…huh?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I got careless earlier, but it won’t be like that now!
 Now, you please stand back.
 I’m grateful for the help, but his opponent will be me!
 Next, for sure, with my ultimate Lotus…!
 Hey, why are you moving forward? I’m his opponent!

31,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Withdraw! You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.
 You don’t have the privilege of deciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Hinata, give it to him!
 Naruto…
 Don’t just take it! Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto...
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyes has changed...
 So you're not going to withdraw?
 I’m not taking responsibility for what happens…
 I don’t want to run away!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji! I challenge you!
 Here!
 A Failure Stands Tall!
 As I thought, this is the extent of it…
 the head family’s power!
 What the--?!
 But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
 N-Not yet…
 What's with this guy…!
 I-It can't be….
 Well, now….
 I guess this is why he's called the most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
 Y-You mean… All this time…?
 That's right! I can see the Chakra Points.
 W-What is he talking about?!
 On the Chakra Network…
 there are 361 energy centers or Chakra opening,
 each about the size of the head of a pin.
 They're called Chakra Points.
 Theoretically, hitting one directly can halt or increase Chakra flow,
 enabling one to gain complete control over an opponent's flow of Chakra.
 Just so you know,
 not even my Sharingan can see Chakra Points!
 Having the penetrating eye is one thing,
 but to hit it so accurately like that during a match,
 well, that's just…
 Lady Hinata...
 What we have here is an unchangeable difference in abilities.
 It's what distinguishes the elite from the failure.
 It is brute, unalterable fact.
 You were destined to regret having said
 that you don't want to run anymore,  the instant you said it.
 And now, you must have abandoned yourself to despair!
 This is your ultimatum…
 Withdraw!
 I-I...
 I-I meant it...
 and am…sticking by…
 every word...
 Hinata…
 I said!
 I'm not gonna run away!
 Because that's…my Way of Ninja!
 I had no idea... Hinata was this tough…
 She's a lot like you.
 Come to think of it… She's always watching you.
 Huh?
 Hinata…
 Bring it on!
 She has reached her limit.
 One more blow and…
 Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
 have completely halted her flow of Chakra.
 That means she can no longer send Chakra
 into her opponent's body to fight in the Gentle Fist.
 This match is as good as over.
 But I never imagined there would be someone this powerful…
 I'm afraid even our Sasuke is no match for him.
 It looks as if Neji may very well take this Exam.
 It's going to take more than what this girl has to bring him down.
 L-Look at those eyes…
 Is he going to try to kill her? No, no, that's absurd.
 Doesn't it seem that…
 Neji’s strength is somehow against the rules?
 He's just too powerful…
 I mean it!
 Go, Hinata!
 Naruto...
 Strength has come back into her eyes…
 I've been watching you…
 I've been watching you closely for many years now!
 Why I wonder…?
 Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
 What a pain!
 It's all your fault!
 Like I care!
 Okay!
 Naruto… d-do your best.
 Transformation!
 I don't know why, but…
 I am Naruto Uzumaki!
 I'm not about to lose to the likes of any of you!
 Is that perfectly clear?!
 I'm not about to lose to the likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
 That idiot.
 He made a roomful of enemies in the space of an instant.
 When I watch Naruto...
 Naruto, stand up!
 If you compete with me for the name of Hokage…
 You… will be the loser!
 I can feel courage welling up.
 I feel that I can hang on, that I can do it…
 that I too am worth something!
 Oh!
 – No! 					– Hinata!
 Hinata...
 At some point, Hinata, who was in the habit of just giving up,
 made up her mind to change.
 Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
 She put every ounce of her being into her training.
 I saw it with my own eyes.
 But even so, she continued to fail all her missions.
 She lost her nerve when faced with real competition
 and became easily discouraged.
 But today's Hinata is different.
 I have never…
 seen…that look in her eyes before.
 Naruto.
 I have always done the watching up to now,
 but, now, finally…
 finally, I am…
 Naruto!
 You just don't get it, do you?
 Your strikes were ineffective from the very first.
 It's the end.
 Hinata… That's enough.
 You lost the match,
 but you've become a new person in the process.
 You did well.
 I want to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Neji's final blow went straight for the heart.
 I feel sorry for her,
 but she won't be standing again now.
 As further fighting is not feasible under these conditions…
 Don't stop it!
 Don't stop the match! Believe it!
 Naruto, stop!
 What on earth are you saying, stupid!
 She's had it. You can see she's unconscious…
 Huh?
 Why do you stand up?
 If you continue like this, you’ll really die!
 He is now finally for the first time truly seeing me.
 I will not be caught looking bad...
 Why?!
 in front of...
 the person I admire most.
 I-I am far from finished!
 Give up the bravado…
 I can tell you're just barely standing.
 You've shouldered the lot of having been born
 to the head family line of the Hyuga…
 And cursed and blamed yourself for being weak...
 But, people cannot change.
 That's just the way it is.
 There is no need for you to suffer any more!
 Surrender to it!
 You're wrong... Brother Neji.
 Because I can tell…
 that you are suffering much more than I.
 What?!
 You are the one who is torn up
 over the fate of head and branch family.
 Neji, the match has been called!
 Oh boy!
 Neji, get a hold of yourself!
 You promised me
 you wouldn't let the head family thing get you riled up!
 Why are all the other Jonin butting in?!
 The head family gets special treatment, eh?
 Hinata?!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Hinata! Are you okay?!
 Hey!
 Naruto…
 Yeah.
 I…
 Do you think…
 I…changed maybe a little bit?
 Hey you, failure!
 I have two pieces of advice for you.
 First, if you intend to call yourself a Shinobi,
 stop that revolting cheering of yours.
 And the second...
 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 Though, I am probably going to be the one fighting Neji…
 but it would be okay with me if you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
 All right already.
 So this is okay then, right, Guy Sensei?
 Lee! You….
 Nice going!
 Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
 Was he trying to kill her then?!
 The precious little time you have would be better spent
 seeing to her than glaring at me.
 Medics!
 Hurry! What's taking so long?!
 S-Sorry.
 Get her on the stretcher. One, two, three.
 It's serious. She 's got about 10 minutes at the most!
 Get her to the emergency room. Pronto!
 Out of the way!
 Hinata…
 Because that's my Way of Ninja.
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy

 The Absolute Defense of the Sand?
 They say no one has ever injured Gaara.
 He's strong as heck and has no weak points.
 Bushy-Brows is no match for him…
 But wait, he's not losing!
 He seems a lot faster than before.
 Is this due to his training?
 I am getting excited about it!

 No, you are the same kind of human as I am.
 A betrayer who doesn’t trust others.
 Betraying your own brother, walking away from the village,
 and capable of thinking only of yourself. The worst kind of man.

 Yes.

 You have no right to even the slightest bit of integrity.
 Boss…
 I'm sorry…
 Boss…
 I couldn't keep…
 the promise I made with you.
 Idate!
 You bastard!
 Darn, what a downpour.
 Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?!
 Looks like it was too hard a task for them.
 Even if they were the same Genin as you,
 seems like the Hidden Leaf ones are better.
 This is terrible…
 But can Genin-level Ninja fight against me?
 Shut up!
 Above!
 Humph… So that's your level, after all.
 I'll use the same method I used on Idate,
 and send you to hell.
 No need to waste my Chakra.
 Sakura!
 Th-These darned things…
 Those are poisoned needles specially made by the Hidden Rain Village.
 They will send you to hell in a few minutes,
 no matter how strong you are.
 Don’t you look down on us! Bastard--!
 Looks like Fukusuke has reached Modoroki Shrine.
 Die gasping.
 It’s a death that fits you Genin brats well.
 Is Wagarashi winning this one too?
 Isn’t there a God or Buddha in this world?
 I miss the old times when Jirocho was in charge.
 Terrible, terrible, I’m drenched.
 You are amazing, Fukusuke.
 Keep on running to the goal, and make our Boss Wagarashi happy.
 Watch it, you scum.
 Who do you think you are talking to?
 What?
 My victory is already assured. Let me relax for a while.
 Bastard, think you're so hot?!
 Cut it out…
 Brother…
 What if something goes wrong during the race?
 Who knows what our boss will do to us.
 All right.
 Just wait and see.
 Darn, that bastard!
 Naruto, Sasuke…
 Take this.
 Sakura… What's that?
 Before leaving the Leaf Village,
 Lady Tsunade handed this to me.
 Take this with you. I am sure it will come in handy.
 Old Lady Tsunade?
 I think he’ll recover consciousness now.
 Sasuke and Naruto, you take this, too.
 O-Okay.
 Also, we’ll be too cold here, so we need to move somewhere else.
 Brother!
 Look! I’ve finally become a Ninja, too!
 I see…
 I’ve got to become the best in everything!
 I’ll train hard, and complete lots of missions.
 And I’ll become a Chunin super fast.
 Then after that, a Jonin.
 I’m going to be like you, Brother!
 I’m Idate, the Swift Runner making headway in life.
 Brother?
 Listen Idate…
 In the world of Shinobi,
 there is something more important than success or power.
 Something more important?
 Until you understand that, it’s too early for you to talk that way.
 Oh!
 He’s conscious now.
 Are you okay?
 What happened to Aoi?!
 He disappeared…
 So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?
 Idate, do you know him?
 He…
 was a teacher when I was in the Leaf Village.
 You…are from the Leaf Village?
 Aoi…betrayed the Leaf Village
 and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.
 What the hell do you mean?
 Not yet.
 You have to rest a little more.
 How is your hand there?
 That hand…
 You kept it clenched all this time.
 Darn! I’d come all this way, and yet I…!
 It’s too early to give up!
 And you tell us that you were once a Shinobi of the Leaf?!
 I forgot all about the Leaf…
 the moment I walked away from the village.
 You walked away from the village?
 I was depressed after failing the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 That was close, Idate…
 Don’t take it so hard.
 There are ways to become a Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.
 Really?!
 Yes, really.
 Just do as I tell you.
 Okay!
 Aoi Sensei…
 Idate…
 Aoi Sensei, I’d brought them as you told me to.
 All right.
 These are indeed the Scroll of Sealing and the legendary blade,
 the Blade of the Thunder God, believed to have been used by the Second Hokage.
 Well done, Idate.
 Now I can become a Chunin, right?
 Sure you can…
 in the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 You are leaving the Leaf together with me,
 taking these as gifts to them.
 But…
 Of course.
 There's no way you can get away with stealing the village’s treasures.
 You tricked me!
 To survive in this world, you must not believe in others…
 Remember that.
 Well, what are you going to do, Idate?
 Either way, you are already a Rogue Ninja.
 You’ll be chained in jail for life, if you are lucky.
 You’ll be chained in jail for life, if you are lucky.
 Ever since then, I haven’t returned to the village.
 I am an irresponsible man who can’t do a single thing right.
 But Boss Jirocho believed in me.
 Even though I'd never been of any use to him.
 Boss Jirocho had faith in me!
 And yet, I…!
 He’s…
 He’s…like the old me…
 No one will ever accept you! Die Naruto!
 Duck down, Naruto!
 I’m…a worthless guy…
 W-Why?
 Because we are the same.
 He’s like me of the old days.
 I go around and around, and get nowhere…
 I can’t do anything right.
 Aoi is right.
 I have…no right to live--
 You idiot!
 There’s a person who still trusts you, right?
 I know, Naruto.
 You felt alone… and you were suffering!
 One is enough!
 The race isn’t over yet!
 You never know how things will turn out unless you try until the very end.
 But…
 Stand up now!
 Naruto, it’s not possible! ldate’s body is still…
 If he can’t run, then I’ll carry him on my back and run!
 The opponent must already be in Modoroki Shrine…
 Don’t give up!
 Hey… Naruto…
 Sasuke…
 Let’s leave it to Naruto here.
 Jirocho is waiting for you, right?
 Pull yourself together!
 Boss, don’t you think he actually ran away?
 He’ll come.
 I believe in Idate!
 If you run away now, you’ll be a loser for your entire life!
 For the people who believe in you and wait for you…
 It’s the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful.
 No problem.
 Edged tools aren’t for hurting people…
 Show them what you’ve got!
 Naruto! Please take me there!
 All right. Leave it to me!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams

 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying

 Hey you!
 What're you jabbering about, lecturing like you're something else?!
 You are so annoying!
 Come on, Idate.
 Boss Jirochi is waiting for you at the finish line, right?
 I don't care if this guy is a Jonin or whatever.
 I'm gonna beat him and make for the finish line with all my might!

33,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 I’m counting on you, Choji!
 Yeah!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 All right, let’s go!
 Human Boulder!
 What?!
 Choji… You are awesome, after all!
 Full Throttle Power! Choji, Ablaze!
 They got away from my Barrier Ninjutsu…
 He’s the only one here.
 Seems like the others went ahead.
 Yeah.
 They’re not around here any more.
 Damn… Just when we thought we caught up.
 Everybody, you did well…
 for some losers.
 What?!
 Who are you calling losers?!
 Once we’re out, it’s our battle to win!
 I-I will do it!
 Wait you two!
 It’s dangerous to fight them head on right now!
 We tore through the barrier! We can do this!
 Tunneling Fang!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Take this! 					– Take this!
 You guys are my meal!
 Darn it!
 Shoulder Charge!
 Knee Lift!
 Not even good enough for an appetizer!
 Be careful everyone! Another tricky one is coming!
 Earth Style Barrier: Earth Dome Prison!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Human Boulder!
 Damn!
 Such useless acts…
 There’s no time.
 We’re going to split into two here!
 Why?!
 I see…
 Even at 5 against 1, with our Chakras taken away,
 he’s not someone we can easily defeat…
 If we take our time, Sasuke will pass the borders.
 If that happens, we won’t be able to handle this on our own.
 So we split up… one team to stop him
 and one to go after Sasuke, right?
 Yeah. The sub leader is going to be you, Neji.
 I found them!
 Neji! Take Kiba and Choji, and go after Sasuke!
 Got it!
 This guy…
 Naruto and I will handle!
 Are you going to put the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?
 Such a foolish Jutsu.
 I don’t need to see that kind of street performance more than once!
 And who was it that got tricked by that street performance earlier?
 He disappeared?!
 Behind us!
 Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!
 He’s nuts!
 Be careful! There’s another one coming!
 You are the platoon leader, if I’m not mistaken.
 You sure do suffer when you have a stupid leader.
 You underlings!
 A stupid leader like this…
 I’ll get rid of for you!
 Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!
 Thanks! Choji…
 Why? Wasting my good intentions…
 If the leader is stupid, then I guess the subordinates are losers.
 Well… I’ll kill you losers before you suffer
 working under a glum shadow lover like him!
 Darn, darn! Babbling on like that!
 I will…!
 He’s mine!
 I will…take care of him!
 Choji…
 What are you saying?!
 He’s not the kind of guy you can handle on your own!
 I will do it!
 Choji… you…
 Shikamaru… Take these Food Pills for everyone…
 Choji… You are not…
 That’s right. I have that secret weapon of mine.
 But Choji, that is…!
 Huh… Losers, I won’t let you have your way!
 He’s coming!
 I’ll get rid of you all here!
 Go, everyone!
 Pills of three colors? They’re not Food Pills.
 What are they?
 First…Spinach Pill!
 Get out of the way! Loser!
 Impossible… He stopped me?!
 Shikamaru, take everybody and go!
 Choji…
 What did we gather for?
 If we lose Sasuke, then we will end up like he said…
 The stupid leader and his losers!
 You better catch up with us, Choji!
 Yeah.
 Everybody, go!
 All right! Let’s go, everyone!
 – Yeah! 					– Right!
 Choji…
 I’m going to get rid of you quick and get rid of those guys too!
 It won’t be that easy…
 What?!
 I will…
 …stop you!
 A parting gift from Choji… Eat it!
 Yeah!
 Thanks, Choji…
 Kiba!
 Thanks!
 Shikamaru… That pill that Choji took earlier..
 It seemed like some sort of trump card,
 but does he have a chance to win?
 He said that he has a secret weapon.
 He brought the Akimichi clan’s ultimate secret pills on this mission…
 These are the Triad Colored Pills of green, yellow, and red.
 If you take it, you can gain explosive powers.
 The energy that each pill contains is enormous!
 I see! I see! So that’s why he was so confident!
 But…there’s always a side effect to any pills that work too well.
 Damn… I didn’t think it would hurt so much with just the Spinach Pill.
 I hope that Choji can settle it with just the green pill.
 Don’t take the red one, no matter what, Choji.
 I’m going to finish you at once!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Spiky Human Boulder.
 He raised the rotational and destructive power
 by using the Kunai Knives as spikes!
 Earth Style: Terra Shield.
 What?!
 I-I did it…?
 Yeah. That’s what I was thinking too.
 Akamaru… 					What is he saying?
 You know that Akamaru can tell the strength of the enemy
 just by the smell, right?
 He’s worried if Choji is going to be able to handle that monster with just the pills.
 True…
 If we were to assess the situation objectively,
 that giant’s ability is unknown…
 The possibility of Choji being able to defeat him might be close to zero.
 But…
 That is how battle is…
 Don’t get carried away, loser!
 Shatter Palm!
 Did you know?
 When there’s a group of people of five or so,
 there’s always one loser.
 That person is always made fun of…
 and when it comes down to it,
 they’ll just toss that person aside like a pawn.
 I’m talking about you!
 Choji. All you want to do is eat. You should train some at least!
 You get teased because you’re like that. You’re just a f--
 You said somebody exceptional, right?
 Shouldn’t we ask Shino or somebody?!
 This guy is useless too…
 That is true…
 No matter how hard I try on my own…
 I…
 Seems like I hit it right on the nose.
 Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,
 seeing that they pick a loser like you to be on the pursuit team.
 Why don’t we finish this up already?!
 Knee Lift!
 Shoulder Charge!
 Huh! You really are a loser to the end!
 Your high spirit didn’t last long at all, only at the beginning…!
 You really are the ideal loser!
 A loser like you shouldn’t have come to a place like this!
 You should blame your stupid leader for choosing you!
 Shikamaru…
 Neji’s right. It’s how a battle is.
 From the start, this mission wasn’t for recreation.
 It’s life or death.
 Hey Shikamaru…
 I already anticipated the worst scenario
 in which we would be fighting separately on our own.
 And at this point,
 if we’re not prepared for “one person, one kill,”
 we might not be able to catch up to Sasuke.
 Choji is a good guy, but he doesn’t have the confidence.
 He thinks that he’s the weakest of all of us.
 He actually is weak. Anybody can see that.
 That’s why he was the first to stay behind to try to be useful.
 Just as I thought…
 But…
 Choji and I have worked as a team for many years,
 so coordinating with him is easiest for me.
 But Shikamaru…
 But, if we fight against each other, you might be stronger.
 I might have given up fighting against you too.
 And you’re you…
 But…
 Shikamaru…has always…
 Shikamaru has always believed in me…
 Choji…are you ready?!
 He believed that I was really strong!
 That’s why he left it up to me alone!
 Just as I thought…
 So everybody thinks that… But…I know…
 More than myself or Neji or any of us here…
 He is stronger!
 And…I believe it.
 Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.
 But…it’s a far cry from being a main dish…
 Let's go, fatso!
 Don’t YOU say that!

 I didn't think the side effects of the secret pill would be strong.
 What do I do? I only have one more pill.

34,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 It’s so quiet, isn’t it?
 Peace is a wonderful thing, isn’t it?
 Being able to… drink sake tranquilly like this…
 Please, this isn’t the time to be drinking sake!
 Especially at a time when the village is enjoying peace…
 you should hurry up and finish up your work!
 Why is it that work never seems to cease?
 That’s because you never bring a single thing to completion, Lady Tsunade!
 There’s disquiet among the Kamizuru Clan?
 That’s a communiqué from the ANBU Unit
 stationed in the Land of the Earth, isn’t it?
 That’s a name one rarely hears.
 The Kamizuru Clan are the insect handlers of the Hidden Stone Village.
 Long ago, they were so famous as to be extolled
 as equals of the Aburame Clan…
 But they’ve died out and hardly anyone remembers their name…
 I see…
 It says there’s been some disquiet, but there can’t be many of them left.
 It’s really nothing to worry about…
 What's the difference?                    Don't All Insects Look Alike?
 Wow… There are so many insects…
 This is truly a paradise for insects…
 We won’t get stung, will we?
 Almost none of these insects will cause bodily harm to humans.
 I do have some of the Aburame Clan’s secret recipe insect repellant…
 but I would prefer not to use it, if at all possible.
 Because it would also repel the Bikochu.
 Then you shouldn’t have brought it out in the first place.
 There’s no mistake…
 That kid in the lead…
 he’s a member of the Abarame Clan, after all.
 I never imagined that we’d bump into them in a place like this.
 Is their objective the Bikochu, Jibachi?
 Anyone who wants to get their hands on a Bikochu
 has to come to this place during this particular period.
 The restoration of the Kamizuru Clan rests on the outcome of this mission…
 We need to get our hands on a Bikochu, no matter what!
 This is a female bikochu.
 Pound its characteristics into your heads.
 Okay!
 Got it.
 Hey, I’ve seen this thing before…
 Hey, really?!
 Where did you see it, Naruto?
 That was…
 When I inadvertently leave some food out, they start coming out of nowhere.
 A whole deluge of them…
 So those were Bikochu…
 If it’s those things, they should be easy to catch.
 Hey…
 Naruto…
 Those are called…cockroaches.
 Huh? Cockroaches?
 You're comparing apples to oranges.
 This thing is completely different!
 They look exactly identical to me…
 – They’re not! – They're not!
 Depending on how one looks of it, this could be an opportunity.
 What do you mean, Suzumebachi?
 It’s been ten days since we came here…
 we haven’t been able to get any leads on the Bikochu.
 However, that kid from the Abarame Clan might…
 That makes sense!
 You mean they might be able to catch a Bikochu…
 From their appearance, it seems they're all Genin.
 If they're able to catch a Bikochu…
 we'll just take it from them.
 All insects look alike.
 Insect Summoning Jutsu!
 There aren’t any…here…
 This thing here is different too, huh…
 Huh?
 Don’t be a burden to everyone…
 This mission is something that I suggested…
 so I will find it without fail!
 Byakugan!
 Just as I thought…
 it’s difficult to perceive things as small as insects.
 Huh?!
 Shino! Kiba!
 Hinata…Did you notice too?
 So…you did too?
 I guess…they think they’re hiding…
 Unfortunately for them,
 we have a whole array of specialists in detecting enemies.
 What should we do, Shino? You’re the leader of this mission.
 If we end up in a battle, there’s the danger of involving the insects…
 and injuring the Bikochu.
 As long as they don't make a move, we'll just watch them closely.
 Got it.
 I wonder if…Naruto noticed.
 If he had noticed, he would have raised a big clamor.
 I don’t want to stir things up. So don’t tell him.
 Okay…
 Hey, Shino! Shino!
 I found it! I found it!
 I’m telling you, I found a Bikochu!
 He found it already?!
 That’s impossible!
 When we spent ten days searching and couldn’t find one…!
 Awesome, Naruto…
 Are you sure, Naruto?
 Let me see it.
 See…this is it, right?
 It’s exactly like the photo, right?
 I might be an insect-hunting genius.
 Huh?
 Does it look the same to you?
 Huh?
 That’s called a goliath beetle…
 Huh?! It’s not the same thing?!
 Bikochu aren’t active at night.
 Which means that…
 Let’s call it a day then.
 Shino… Shino!
 I found one! This time there’s no mistake!
 It’s probably a completely different insect again.
 Naruto…
 Yeah! There’s no mistake!
 Over here! Over here!
 If you don’t hurry, it’ll fly off somewhere!
 Hey, didn’t you bring it with you?
 I found one that’s resting in a tree.
 The shape of its feelers is certainly the same as Bikochu.
 And all the characteristics match.
 They do, don't they? There’s no mistake it’s this thing, right?!
 B-But…Naruto…
 This thing is different after all, isn’t it?
 Why is that?
 It's not only size! How would you make this one sniff scents?!
 Like this!
 This thing is called a Fake Bikochu.
 It has an extremely violent temperament…
 It gets angry if one touches its nose and sometimes even eats humans…
 What?
 Huh?
 Hey, Shino! Didn’t you say there weren’t any dangerous insects!
 Almost none… but not zero.
 Kurobachi… Jibachi…
 Do you really think they'll be able to catch a Bikochu?
 – That might be difficult… – That might be difficult…
 Unless I control my Chakra more perfectly
 I won’t be able to find something as small as an insect!
 To come all this way and continue training…
 That’s quite admirable…
 The air pressure has changed.
 That’s a sure sign that the weather will change.
 Yeah, I realize that.
 A wind charged with moisture has started blowing…
 This means there’s gonna be rainfall.
 When it’s such good weather?
 But I can see clouds off in the distance…
 Hinata…
 We need to hurry.
 Because it’s said that the Bikochu only lays an egg when it rains
 and larva emerges from the egg the following morning.
 In other words,
 if it rains today, it'll become a mature larva tomorrow morning.
 In view of the season, this may well be our last chance.
 If this chance slips by,
 it will become impossible to search for Sasuke using a Bikochu…
 Sasuke…
 It’ll be fine. I’ll find it without fail!
 Don’t rain… Don’t rain yet!
 Damn! Where is it?!
 Please come on out before it rains!
 Naruto…
 What are we gonna do…
 if those guys don’t find a Bikochu, Suzumebachi?
 It was the Aburame Clan
 who was the catalyst in the downfall of the Kamizuru Clan…
 In order to avenge our clan's longstanding grudge…
 we will finish them off!
 Those guys… They haven’t made a move yet.
 They must know that we’re searching for the Bikochu.
 Which means that they must be waiting for us to find one.
 I see…So their plan is to steal it from us once we’ve found one...
 What cheapskates…
 Rain…
 Not this one either!
 Damn! When I told it not to rain!
 There's no more time…
 Don’t be a burden to everyone…
 So ultimately… I contributed nothing.
 There’s still plenty of time!
 Naruto…
 I will not go back on my word… That’s my Way of Ninja!
 That’s right…
 This mission is something I suggested!
 When Naruto hasn’t given up, what’s up with me giving up?!
 Hinata!
 This rain may be very advantageous to you.
 What do you mean?
 When the surrounding temperature cools,
 living creatures become easier to discern.
 Naruto, I won’t give up either!
 Byakugan!
 I have to… I have to concentrate more…
 I need to… I need to… control my Chakra!
 I can see them! So those are insects!
 That insect…is wrong…
 This insect is wrong too.
 That’s…!
 There it is!
 Naruto! On the side of that tree! There’s a Bikochu there!
 I caught it!
 We did it…!
 I did it! I caught it!
 There’s no mistake. lt’s a female Bikochu.
 – Yes! I did it! 					– Cripes…
 Your tenacity amazes me, Naruto!
 That’s so great, Naruto!
 Hinata! It’s thanks to you!
 Naruto…is…hugging me…!
 What’s the matter, Akamaru?
 All right! It’s an egg!
 It laid an egg, huh…
 Really?
 It will emerge by tomorrow…
 So then we should make it recognize Sasuke’s scent, right?!
 Sasuke… I’ll find you without fail!
 It looks like they finally found one…
 The time has come, hasn’t it?
 Yeah…
 That Naruto… He suddenly…
 pressed his face so close to mine…
 So…you were able to dodge that one just now.
 That was pretty well done for a Genin.
 They’re the ones who’ve been trailing us all this time…
 However, I wonder if you’ll be able to escape from this attack?
 Ninja Art…Honey Jutsu!
 Bees?!
 No… that’s…!
 It looks like you’ve noticed, huh. That’s honey.
 Honey that adheres like a bonding agent!
 I used up all my Chakra earlier…
 That thing is a real bee.
 Naruto…
 What do you think, Akamaru?
 I see…
 I was convinced that those guys would make some kind of move.
 There hasn’t been any sign of them since earlier on…
 There’s a possibility that we’ve overlooked something.
 Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 Where’s Hinata?
 She said she was gonna go wash her face.
 Hmm…
 But it’s been quite some time. I wonder what she’s doing?
 Could it be that…?!
 Huh? What?
 – Naruto! 					– Wha--?!
 A letter on a Kunai?
 Huh?!
 We are holding the Kunoichi brat hostage.
 If you want to get her back,
 it’ll be in exchange for the Bikochu.
 Come to the top of the eastern hill later tonight.
 Damn! So that was their move!
 Hinata…!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 Damn! We've run out of options!
 It's too soon to give up.
 But we don't even know where Hinata is?!
 No, there's one place Hinata is sure to appear.
 I get it! The place where the exchange will take place!
 We have one chance.

 Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
 Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe
 Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
 Right here right now (Bang) Hit it straight like a line drive!
 Right here right now (Burn)
 Down a difficult road filled with endless struggles
 Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
 An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
 There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

 Right here right now (Bang) Hit it straight like a line drive!
 Right here right now (Burn) We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
 Okay! Let’s go!
 Huh?
 ""Let's go,"" with so much energy…
 Don't act like a little kid!
 Oh? You’re in a bad mood.
 Because! Because! lt's in the middle of my training!
 There are three steps in the training, right?!
 I’m only done with the second step!
 You can do the third step even while walking.
 What! Really?!
 A balloon?
 Here!
 What’s this…? An ordinary balloon?
 The first step is “Spin.” The second step is “Power.”
 And finally, the third step is this.
 An Impossible Choice: The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart
 Which one is “this”?!
 Watch me, it looks as if I am simply holding a balloon…
 You say it “looks as if,” but nothing is really happening.
 Then, I will do the same thing on my left hand.
 Let’s see what’s really happening inside the balloon.
 Wow!
 The Chakra is randomly spinning and going faster and faster…
 But still, it’s perfectly round… lt’s almost like…
 Like a small typhoon, right?
 What’s happening in your left hand…
 is happening inside that balloon in your right hand, too?
 Yeah! That’s right.
 Cool…
 The balloon isn’t moving at all even if he’s spinning that much Chakra…
 There’s more power than that time the rubber ball popped,
 and it’s spinning a lot more too!
 Listen, in this third step,
 you’ve got to use 100% of what you have learned…
 and retain them.
 In other words, while keeping the “Spin” and the “Power” at their max,
 imagine creating a single layer within the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra within it.
 Got it!
 So, this training is about keeping
 the spin and power that I did in the second step,
 and conversely, trying not to pop a delicate balloon!
 Oh! That’s the most perceptive you've been so far!
 Huh?
 But, what’s the point in going to all the trouble?!
 In short, it means this.
 Watch! It’s like this up until the second step of the training.
 Next, after you have mastered the third step!
 This is what happens!
 If you can keep this small typhoon the size of your palm,
 the force won’t disperse.
 The spinning gets faster and faster
 and the power gets more and more compressed.
 And the destructive power will reach its max.
 Well, so, that’s that.
 All right! I’ll do this, too!
 Okay, this feels right…
 Now!
 Retain it here!
 Retain…
 Retain…
 No cutting-corners!
 You’ve got to put out 100% spin and power, and retain them.
 You gotta be kidding…
 Unless I can perfectly control all my power, it’s impossible!
 Now I can see it…
 This third step…
 It’s on a totally different level compared to the others.
 I told you…
 With an achievement difficulty of Rank A, it’s a super advanced Ninjutsu.
 Well, I’m done explaining! We’ll continue as we go on walking.
 Hey, hey!
 We don’t need to rush so much, until I can properly…
 We have already wasted enough time waiting for your body to recover.
 There’s no guarantee that Tsunade stays in this town much longer.
 What?!
 But, but…
 It’s not like an old acquaintance is going to conveniently pop up
 and start talking about the good old times with her…
 Come on, let’s go!
 All right…
 Long time no see…Orochimaru.
 I’d looked for you everywhere.
 What do you want from me after so long a time?
 You aren’t thinking of talking about the old days…?
 Actually, I need to ask you for a little favor…
 His heartbeat is fast…
 From that complexion, he must have a high fever.
 He must have been fatigued for quite some time…
 And that arm…
 Lady Tsunade.
 You must have understood by now.
 Go to someone else, I don’t treat anyone any more.
 That won’t do…
 You must know how serious this wound is…
 No one can treat this wound.
 Except for one of the Legendary “Sannin”
 who won her fame as a medical specialist, Princess Tsunade…
 You…
 That arm… it’s not an ordinary wound.
 A special Sealing Jutsu or something…?
 What have you done?
 Well, it just happened… when I killed the Third Hokage.
 You… Really?
 Humph. Don’t look so scary.
 Anything that has a form will one day decay…
 Same goes for humans.
 You must already know that too.
 For you have let two of your most beloved ones die…
 Let two of the most beloved ones die?
 I see… He thinks of terrible things.
 That was a really terrible way to die…
 You!
 Poisoned…
 She’s fast!
 Get out of my way!
 Won’t let you!
 Calm down, Shizune!
 This attendant…is an expert.
 Orochimaru…
 Your personality's been like this for a long time.
 And you know my personality very well…
 So stop fooling around with me.
 I’ll kill you, bastard!
 She’s powerful…
 And so scary… she definitely must be single.
 Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered…
 Hey Naruto, there’s no time to be falling.
 If we don’t hurry,
 who knows where that shrew will disappear again.
 Hey you, Pervy Sage!
 That’s no way to speak to a hard-working apprentice!
 Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now, not you.
 Well, what the heck!
 To have this Pervy Sage come all the way to meet her…
 Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?
 Hope she’s still here…
 We didn’t come here to fight.
 We just want to negotiate with you!
 Negotiate?
 Yes.
 Don’t make me laugh!
 I’ve already told you once. Get out of my sight!
 We can’t do that.
 Get out of my sight.
 You are the only one who can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arm.
 Get out of my sight.
 We’re not asking you to do it for free.
 Let’s make a deal!
 I’ll count up to five. Leave before I’m done.
 Or else, I’ll make you disappear myself.
 Please calm down. lt won’t be a bad deal for you…
 Five…
 Four…
 Three…
 Two…
 One…
 I’ll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Since we haven’t disappeared yet,
 I’m guessing that the deal is made?
 Yes. I do know this young lady…
 Really?
 Yeah.
 To win back the money she lost here, I think she said…
 she was going over there.
 Spin… Power…
 Letting them out to their max and retain it…
 Hey, kid.
 Hmm?
 Wanna gamble a bit, too?
 Over there? Where is that?
 Hmm?
 See, if the total number of the pips on these dices
 comes out as even numbers, that’s “Cho”
 and if it’s odd, that’s “Han.”
 Shut up! I am training right now, don’t bug me!
 What nonsense! This is a gambling house.
 Instead of that balloon, let’s play with these.
 No way! I don’t have any time to be playing with those dice!
 Ha, what a boring kid!
 Shut up!
 So…can you tell me where that is?
 Well, you can’t expect things to be free in a gambling house, you know?
 Okay…
 Let’s make a deal. The information will be free if you win…
 And if you lose, I’ll give it to you for 1000 ryo.
 All right!
 So choose, odd or even!
 Okay! Here we go…
 Well, so… since I am exactly 50 years old.
 I’ll go for…even!
 If it’s odd, I win…
 I’ll open it now.
 Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!
 W-What the heck--?!
 1000 ryo…
 Nice, Naruto!
 Looks like I won…
 Darn! It didn’t work again!
 Retain…
 Where shall I look next?
 Geez, she’s nowhere to be found!
 Hm? Me?
 Lotto?
 Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.
 Come and play with this fun, fun Lotto.
 There’s one that you know the result right away.
 Which one do you want?
 Really, you are so much cuter being chubby!
 I can’t believe he won with just one draw.
 He’s very talented in this…
 though his talent in Jutsu is still immature.
 Well…anyhow…
 Where could have Tsunade gone?
 She couldn’t have gone that far in this short amount of time.
 I guess we’ll have to search for her from a higher place.
 If I remember it correctly, this is a castle town.
 If we go up to the castle…
 Naruto! This way!
 Don’t you want to see those two… Tsunade?
 Nawaki…Dan…
 If I treat your arms, what do you intend to do with them?
 Well, I don’t like to lie…
 So, I will tell you the truth.
 Hey, hey! Where is the castle?
 It’s not there…?
 In addition to getting what I want…
 This time, I will completely destroy the Leaf Village!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Hey, enough already!
 Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!
 Who cares if she is the legendary Kunoichi?!
 Who cares if she's the medical specialist?!
 There's no way I'll accept this person as the new Hokage!
 If she belittles the Third and Fourth Hokages…
 I don't care if she's the candidate to be the Fifth Hokage!
 I'll kick her butt!

36,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Kakashi Sensei…
 The mission in the Land of Birds is over…
 That is enough.
 But, then what about Naruto…?
 As the leader, I am responsible for all of this.
 Sacrifice is an unavoidable part of Shinobi missions…
 Now…
 Let’s go back to our village!
 Do you think they’re really going back to their village, Nagare?
 Perhaps…
 But I’m concerned about that masked guy who joined up with them later…
 Shall I follow him, Hokushin?
 No, I’ll do that. You give the report.
 All right…
 The Death of Naruto
 How did things turn out…?
 The two as well as the one who joined up with them later…
 seem to have crossed the border
 and are heading for the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I see.
 And it seems Lord Sagi took care
 of the one who infiltrated the residence of the feudal lord.
 Very nice indeed.
 What’re they doing there for the past hour…?
 P-Persimmon! 					Wh-What the--?
 – Ouch… 					– That hurts…
 It couldn’t be!
 Substitution Jutsu! Since when…?
 They tricked me! Those Leaf Shinobi…
 Lord Komei… Come out.
 Land of Birds Tactician Komei.
 You have abused the key position in this land of tactician
 and committed the crime of assassinating
 the previous feudal lord Lord Owashi and his child Lady Toki.
 And you also ordered a subordinate
 to run wild as the ghost called the Cursed Warrior,
 disturbed the public, you undermined the government of the land,
 endangered Lord Sagi’s position of feudal lord
 and attempted to attain the position himself,
 an unforgivable crime of treason!
 Therefore, you are ordered to perform seppuku!
 I see… That explains it.
 You ensnared me, didn’t you, Moso?!
 You’re disgraceful, Komei! lf you’re a warrior, kill yourself like one!
 Assist him with the seppuku at once!
 – Yes, my lord! – Yes, my lord!
 Is this it now…?
 Wh-What?!
 Hidden Mist Jutsu? No! This is…
 It does not matter! Kill him!
 Yes, my lord!
 Begging your pardon, I shall assist!
 Who are you?!
 Wh-What is this? What’s going on?!
 – The Cursed Warrior! – It’s the Cursed Warrior…
 That’s the Cursed Warrior?!
 Yes!
 After him! Don’t let him get away!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 You guys go after him as is…!
 I’ve got something I want to look into,
 so I’ll be going on ahead!
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 I knew it!
 You two were conspirators, right?!
 Hold it!
 You’re the guys from the other night…
 I’ve witnessed the true identity of the ghost.
 Who’s there?
 Hey-hey, Komei.
 You’re the one responsible for controlling the Cursed Warrior, right?
 I was also attempting to investigate
 the true identity of the Cursed Warrior that day…
 I was almost sure it couldn’t be anyone but that person…
 What a pain! I’ll expose the true identity here.
 Don’t bother…
 Kakashi Sensei. Where were you until now?
 I’ll explain later. Go on ahead!
 Hurry! You’re going with them.
 But…
 Let’s go, Tenten!
 Wait, Neji!
 Come on out…
 You were following me the whole time, right?
 If that’s your intention…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it, Kakashi?
 Smoke out the Ninja hiding on the temple grounds…
 Consider it done.
 Hey! You there…
 Hide-and-seek is over. Come on out now!
 I can’t fool a dog’s nose, as would be expected…
 You finally grace me with your presence, huh?
 Why is there a hole… in a place like this?
 I have heard the feudal lord built secret passages such as this
 all over the land in order to look in on the lives of the general public…
 The feudal lord?!
 Then that Cursed Warrior has something to do
 with the feudal lord…?
 At the very least, it seems he’s not a ghost.
 When the time comes,
 I’m sure he will reveal his true identity from his end.
 Isn’t it common sense for hired Ninja
 to return quietly to their village after completing a mission?
 It’s different in the case
 of the premise of the commissioned mission breaking down.
 There were too many suspicious points in this mission.
 You’re sticking your nose too far into the business of another land.
 Here you could’ve returned safely to your land
 if you hadn’t secretively sniffed around like a dog.
 Excuse me for being a dog!
 Universal Assimilation Jutsu!
 Prepare yourself!
 What?!
 What is this guy?!
 Has he introduced properties of stone into his body?
 Since you’ve learned of part of this land’s secrets,
 I can’t let you live!
 He seems to be a somewhat troublesome opponent.
 Yeah. That’s good enough, Pakkun.
 I’ll be okay by myself from here on.
 I see… See you later!
 Assimilation: Rock Tank.
 I’ll crush you!
 A Shadow Clone…?!
 This is as far as it goes…
 It can’t be…
 A Paper Bomb?!
 Now… That should be enough, right?
 Huh?
 Yeah… We should be okay having come this far.
 Th-That voice…?!
 N-Naruto…!
 I knew it.
 The true identity of the Cursed Warrior wasn’t Lord Sagi?
 Your…
 Your true identity is…
 Lord Sagi?! It is you, Lord Sagi?
 From the way he was standing still,
 I thought for sure it was Lord Sagi.
 There’s a profound reason for this…
 What’re you doing, Tenten?!
 Then tell me sooner!
 It seems you also knew it was Naruto, Neji.
 Yeah… Ages ago.
 Jeez, you two!
 I was really worried!
 There was a surveillance Shinobi following us the whole time, right?
 Neji, Tenten… Don’t look back.
 We’re being followed!
 We’re going back to the Land of Birds.
 Just do as I say… Got it?!
 Y-Yes!
 Understood…
 But didn’t we shake the pursuer with Substitution?
 Yes… Once…
 However…
 when we chased the Cursed Warrior from the execution grounds…
 a different Shinobi followed us.
 Jeez… Am I the only one who didn’t know?
 It was a waste to worry!
 Then you, in the place of Lord Sagi…?
 Yeah…
 I see… So Lord Sagi is safe!
 You okay, mister?!
 I’m sorry…
 That Moso acted rashly,
 forcing me to make a false confession.
 Man, you’ve been beaten up good…
 Well, we’ll tell you about the developments inside.
 Sagi is waiting!
 Assimilation: Rock Shower!
 We’re Wandering Shinobi…
 We make do without having a village by going around to every village,
 stealing Jutsu and devising new Ninjutsu.
 For example, a Jutsu like this one, too…
 S-Say what?
 Sharingan!
 Assimilation: Sand Coffin!
 He’s using the same Jutsu as Gaara!
 Assimilation: Sand Funeral!
 Sagi!
 How’s Chishima doing…?
 He’s okay… There’s no threat to his life.
 He’s resting and receiving treatment
 in the treatment room of my residence.
 That’s good…
 Did something happen to Chishima?
 Who…? Who hurt him?!
 Komei… I’m sorry for the misunderstanding!
 My lord, I don't deserve those magnanimous words!
 Although he had suffered injuries, Chishima came to tell me.
 At that time…
 I must not let you live as is
 now that you have learned of everything!
 As the thief who snuck into the residence of the feudal lord,
 your fate is the death sentence!
 No way…!
 L-Lord Sagi…
 Chishima?!
 Bro!
 Shuriken wounds…?
 Go to the residence doctor!
 Lord Sagi…
 Please listen…
 Lord Moso, no, Moso has betrayed you…
 What?
 Moso was the one
 who killed your father, Lord Owashi, and Lady Toki!
 And Moso had his own Ninja henchmen use the guardsmen shuriken
 to falsely accuse Lord Komei…
 I’m sure Lord Komei learned of Moso’s scheme and…
 Hang in there, Chishima!
 Lord Sagi, please… Stop Lord Komei’s execution.
 We have to go save him quickly!
 I must not stop the execution!
 Wh-Why is that?!
 I won’t be able to have my revenge
 if Moso realizes that I have learned the truth…
 Are you saying it doesn’t matter who is sacrificed
 if it’s for the sake of your revenge?!
 Then what would you do?
 Komei is being kept under strict watch by powerful soldiers.
 We would have no chance of winning
 if theywe were to cause a rebellion there…
 Then I’ll go! I will save Komei on my own!
 You don’t have a problem with that, do you?
 Lord Sagi…
 Do as you like…
 And so I disguised myself as the Cursed Warrior.
 I played the part of Cursed Warrior
 and attempted to look for the assassination culprit…
 But against my intentions…
 Instead of finding the true culprit…
 Komei… I was used as a tool to incriminate you.
 I thought the Cursed Warrior I encountered in my bedroom
 was you, Lord Sagi…
 And so I headed for the abandoned temple
 where the Cursed Warrior once vanished.
 There I encountered the Cursed Warrior, but…
 That Cursed Warrior wasn’t me.
 Perhaps it was a fake that Moso devised.
 That’s it, believe it! All of it was that old man Moso’s trap!
 That Moso!
 Did he think to first dispose of me
 and then eventually attempt to rule the Land of Birds
 by doing away with Lord Sagi?
 That guy acting like a good guy!
 I’ll grab him up and kick his butt!
 Naruto, was it? You did good work.
 However…
 I will take care of things from here on!
 Well… But…
 I will even the score by myself.
 As long as the score isn’t settled…
 the clock inside my heart… will remain stopped in the past!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 What do you mean you will even the score on your own?!
 What good can you do going by yourself?!
 Even you did avenge them, the dead won’t come back!
 Do you still insist on having  revenge?!
 Would that make you feel better?!
 Would that really make your father and sister happy?!

37,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Such intensity...
 If I take a breath or move my eyes I will be marked and killed –
 that's what I'm feeling..
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour, I'll go mad.
 Facing a Jonin intent to kill…
 This sensation is like having my life held in limbo...
 No way! I'd rather die to escape this feeling!
 Sasuke...
 Don't worry. I'll protect you all with my life.
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed.
 I don't know about that...
 It's over.
 Sensei! Behind you!!
 Die!!
 The Water Clone Jutsu...?
 It can't be.
 Don't move!
 The Oath of Pain
 It's over.
 W-Wow!!
 Did you say it's over?
 You don't understand, do you?
 You won't be able to beat me just by making like a monkey…
 No chance.
 But, I must say you're good.
 My Water Clone Jutsu was being copied at that point…
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed.
 By letting the clone talk as if it were you, you succeeded in distracting me.
 And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu to hide yourself to see what I was doing…
 But…
 I'm not a fool.
 That one was a fake too!
 Now!
 Makibishi spikes…!
 How foolish...!
 Sensei!
 Oh, I can't believe that Kakashi Sensei got …
 kicked away like that….
 His Taijutsu skills are also extremely good.
 W-What's with this water...? lt's awfully heavy.
 Humph... Fool!
 It's the Water Prison Jutsu!
 Darn it.
 My temporary escape into the water…
 was a huge mistake!
 You're caught…
 It's a special prison that makes it impossible for you to escape!
 It makes things harder having you able to act.
 Now…Kakashi.
 I'll have to settle things with you later.
 First, I will finish those guys off.
 Water Clone Jutsu…
 Didn't expect this level of skill…
 You're acting big, wearing a headband like a Ninja…
 But…a real Ninja is one
 who has hovered between life and death numerous times.
 In other words,
 only those who are worth being listed in my Bingo Book
 deserve to be called Ninja.
 Guys like you can't be called real Ninja.
 He's disappeared again!
 You're just a kid!
 Naruto!
 You three! Take Tazuna and run!
 You have no chance against this guy!
 As long as he has me trapped in this Water Prison,
 he won't be able to move from here.
 And he shouldn't be able to use the Water Clone Jutsu
 if he's far enough away from his real body.
 In any case, just run for now!
 Run away?
 You've got to be kidding me.
 That option was gone from the moment you got caught.
 Even if we ran,
 without you, sooner or later we'd be defeated by Zabuza…
 and we'd all be destroyed.
 Even if we were to reform the Manji defense,
 it would be impossible to block his attacks.
 In the end…
 we'll have...
 no options left.
 In order for us to survive, our only option is to rescue you.
 We'll just have to do it!
 There…!
 Too easy.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 T-This is the Jonin level… A real Ninja…
 We've got to run… At this rate…
 Seriously…! Seriously…!
 We'll be killed!!
 I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!
 I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued…
 I'll never be afraid or be a coward.
 Are you hurt…scaredy cat?
 I won't lose to Sasuke.
 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?
 This?
 This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.
 Congratulations on your graduation.
 That's because you're all squirts
 who don't have the qualifications to become Ninjas.
 Missions are all risky assignments.
 You pass!
 I'm not that little prankster that you think I am!
 I'm going to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to get the entire Village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 That's right…
 I am a Ninja now. And...
 I decided that I was not going to run anymore!
 That I wouldn't run away…!
 Y-You fool! Stop it!
 Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!
 Humph! Fool...
 What are you thinking… charging off on your own?!
 Even Sasuke is no match for him…
 No matter how hard we try, we Genin are no match for him…
 Huh...?!
 The headband….?!
 Hey! You, with no brows...
 Record in your Bingo Book…
 about the man who will one day become the Leaf Village's Hokage.
 Leaf-style Ninja…
 Naruto Uzumaki!!
 Naruto…
 When I first saw that little kid, he seemed so unreliable…
 Sasuke! Lend me your ear!
 What is it?
 I have a plan.
 You want to discuss plans under these circumstances…?
 This guy...!
 Humph! You are talking of teamwork?
 W-What is this feeling…?
 Was Naruto so…?
 Now...
 Let's get wild…
 Now, let's get wild!
 Such loud snorting, but do you have a winning plan?
 T-This isn't good…
 What are you guys doing! I told you to run!
 It was obvious what was going to happen once I was caught!
 Hurry! Run!
 Listen to me! Our mission is to protect Tazuna!
 Have you forgotten that?!
 Old man….
 Well...
 This is a seed that I planted…
 I can't say that I want my life to be spared.
 Sorry, you guys…
 Fight as much as you want!
 You hear that?
 Are you ready?
 You guys really haven't learned anything, have you?
 W-What?!
 You're still playing at being Ninja?
 When I was your age,
 this hand was already stained red with blood!
 Zabuza, the Demon!
 Ohh…? It seems that you've heard of me.
 A long time ago, in the Mist Village, often called the town of Blood Mist,
 Ninja candidates faced their biggest hurdle.
 So you also know about that graduation exam…
 That graduation exam?
 What is it...?
 This graduation exam that you're talking about...
 The students killed each other.
 What….?
 Classmates who had shared rice from the same pot
 formed pairs and tried to kill each other.
 It didn't end until one of them died.
 Partners who used to talk about each other's dreams and aspirations…
 How cruel…
 Ten years ago,
 the Mist Village's graduation exam was forced to undergo drastic reform.
 That was because an evil demon had appeared on the scene the previous year.
 Reform?
 What about the reform?
 What had that evil demon done?
 With no scruples or hesitation…
 a young boy who didn't even have the qualifications for being a Ninja,
 annihilated over a hundred examinees.
 That sure was…fun…
 Sasuke!
 Die!
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu, and there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after all…
 There is no way that you can defeat the guy!
 There is only one way left to defeat this guy!
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of Shadows…
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see. This time it's aiming for my real body…
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow...!
 This is... The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too naïve...
 He dodged it!!
 Here it is!
 Yes! The plan worked!!
 That Zabuza had no clue as to what I was thinking,
 and I fooled him!
 Ninja must be able to see through the obvious.
 Did you see that – the Leaf-style fighting of Naruto Uzumaki?!
 Kakashi Sensei, the rest is up to you.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 If there’s an instance that we become separated,
 don’t trust him if he looks like your teammate.
 Just like now there’s a possibility
 that an enemy will transform to get close to us!
 Yeah.
 So what do we do?
 We’ll decide on a password.
 Password?
 I’ll only say it once so listen closely.
 You ask Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
 And the answer is this:
 “It is a chance to sneak up where a large  number of enemies are making a scene.
 “The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 “It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 “The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.”
 That’s it.
 H-Huge!
 T-Tail!
 You want our Earth Scroll, don’t you?
 Well, let's begin...
 the battle for the Scrolls.
 Life or death!
 If this creature doesn’t want to spit me out …
 I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I can’t move!
 I wanted you to entertain me more.
 It’s too bad.
 Move!
 He wiped out the fear with pain.
 As expected, he’s not the average prey.
 Don’t come near me!
 Don’t lower your guard, not even for a moment…
 A prey must always stay tense and flee desperately
 before a predator!
 Sorry Sasuke.
 Naruto!
 The password… I forgot it!
 Naruto's Counterattack: Never Give In!
 The password... I forgot it!
 That’s all right, Naruto!
 Awesome!
 Naruto!
 I know you tried to be cool and intended to rescue us, but…
 Don’t put your nose in this!
 Escape!
 This thing… She’s on a far different level!
 Seems like you brought that giant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.
 No matter how you look, she looks like a snake…
 I get it, it was the handiwork of this woman.
 The situation has never gotten any better with him showing up for the rescue.
 But what should I do…?
 Hey hey hey! Evidently you’ve been bullying the weakling!
 Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,
 I’m going to wipe the floor with you!
 Darn it! If it continues like this, all three of us are done for!
 What should I do?
 Sasuke...
 It’s no good.
 This is the only way.
 Wait.
 Hmm?
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 If it’s the scroll you want, I’ll give it to you.
 I’m asking you. Just take this and go.
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, Sasuke! What are you doing?
 Why are you giving our scroll to the enemy?
 You, shut up!
 What …?!
 I see… 					You’re sensible.
 The only thing the “prey” can hope for from the “predator” is
 presenting other food and pray you would be spared, isn’t it?
 Take it.
 Wha--?!
 You! Don’t interfere with this!
 Don’t you understand this situation?!
 What're you doing all of a sudden?!
 As for me,  I don’t remember the password…
 So I got no way to make sure.
 But you, you’re an imposter Sasuke,  aren’t you?
 Naruto!
 W-What are you trying to start?!
 You loser! 					I’m the real me!
 Liar.
 This, this stupid coward is... absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!
 I don’t know how strong she is but,
 how can you be sure that she’ll let us go if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!
 You’re the one who choked and doesn’t understand this situation!
 Naruto.
 That’s correct.
 The Scroll.
 I could just kill you and seize it.
 Don’t mess with me!
 Run, Naruto! Stop it!
 Darn it!
 I’ve lost confidence in you, Sasuke!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 There are three corpses.
 This is some kind of Ninja Art, isn’t it… ?
 This is bad.
 We have a problem, from the get go.
 I’ll be darned.
 Inform Anko, the Proctor of the second test.
 Yes, sir!
 If you’re going to have dumplings, you’ve got to have sweet red bean soup.
 Okay... Once I’ve eaten this,
 I should break through and go wait at the tower for the kids.
 With this program, the quick kids should clear it soon.
 The Leaf Village mark, perfect!
 We have a problem, Ms. Anko!
 Huh? What, so suddenly?
 Corpses! Three of them!
 Moreover, they’re strange.
 Anyway, please come!
 Strange?
 I checked their possessions and identification,
 Ninjas from Grass Village registered in the Chunin Exam, but…
 As you can see...
 They have no faces.
 Yes.
 They’re smooth and flat, like they melted away.
 Without a doubt...
 This Jutsu is...
 that man’s...
 Why is he at this test…?
 Show me the ID photos of these three Grass Village Ninjas.
 It’s on their applications.
 Yes!
 So this one’s face was robbed.
 Then, at that time it was already…
 I’ll return… the Kunai knife.
 Thank you for your trouble.
 We’re in big trouble.
 Huh?!
 Communicate this to Lord Hokage right away!
 Make a call for action to the Anbu Black Ops
 to assemble more than two squads to the Forest of Death!
 Starting now, I’m going to follow these guys!
 Got it?
 Yes!
 That guy…
 That guy... has come to Leaf Village!
 Cute.
 You’re such a cute prey.
 Naruto!
 Narutooo!
 Well, polish him off.
 Shove it!
 This brat! Can’t be…
 Naruto… He’s lost control…
 But... that Naruto, why is he so strong?!
 Those eyes...
 There’s no mistake.
 That’s... Naruto?!
 This just got interesting.
 Next is...
 Sasuke.
 Now what’s your move?!
 Sasuke!
 I have to hurry.
 I get this...
 bad feeling.
 Hey.  Are you hurt?
 Scaredy cat?!
 Naruto!
 Hey!
 Are you hurt...
 Scaredy cat?
 Sasuke!
 This stupid coward is absolutely not the Sasuke I know!
 Huh?!
 Darn it! 					Let me go!
 You stupid snake!
 To think that the nine-tailed brat lived…
 When you get excited, a bit of the nine-tail’s power trickles out…
 You’ve grown up interesting.
 Look…
 The Seal is appearing on your skin like a tattoo.
 Five-Pronged…Sealing!
 Sasuke! Help Naruto!
 Twelve years since the seal…
 Naruto’s Chakras and the nine-tail’s Chakras are beginning to act in synch…
 But  now... you’re in the way.
 He’s gonna fall as it is!
 Naruto!
 What happened Sasuke?!
 Sasuke…
 Naruto’s certainly different from you, Sasuke.
 He’s a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
 But he’s not in the least a coward!
 Right? 					lsn’t that right?
 You foolish little brother.
 If you want to kill me, resent me, hate me and…
 continue to live your ugly life.
 Flee.
 Flee and hang on to your life.
 No!
 Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan… his blood has begun to stir…
 Sasuke!
 I should take my time and confirm his true power.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm an avenger.
 To defeat my brother, today I have to survive!
 But how can a person who won't risk his life in a situation like this
 beat my brother?
 Calm down, you should be able to see.
 There should be some way to intercept her movements.

 There’s nothing to worry about…
 What?

 Withdrawing like that…
 I don’t know what you’re up to…
 but the timing is perfect.
 This thing of mine also takes time!
 Hey, is something the matter?
 No…
 It must be my imagination…
 Hurry up!
 Sensei…
 Hm?
 What did you mean when you said that you didn’t get here late for nothing?
 Hmm…
 You want to know why?
 Like I said, this isn’t the time to be talking about that!
 Shut up and watch him.
 ‘Cause you’ll get a real surprise.
 That idiot…
 Gaara…we never know when the signal is going to come!
 Yeah… I’m gonna tear him open.
 That’s how it comes out. What?
 The contents…
 Lots and lots are coming out, right?
 I’ll give it all to you.
 I’m always a good boy!
 Yeah, let’s do it.
 Mother, I’m watching so…
 Darn! He’s totally useless, no matter what we do now.
 He’s not even abiding by the plan.
 He looks like he’s just going to screw things up!
 That Gaara!
 Hey, hey, wouldn’t it be better if we flee…?
 Plan…?
 How’s it going?
 All preparations are proceeding in accordance with the timeline.
 Please hurry up with preparation for Summoning.
 I want to be sure we’re able to make our move at any time.
 Understood!
 All right, I’ll leave that to you.
 D-Don’t tell me that…
 The reason I decided to train Sasuke was…
 because he was like me.
 A physical Activation?!
 I see…
 That’s why he went through the physical training
 and increased his speed significantly…!
 That’s right!
 Awesome…
 The Chakra is clearly visible to the naked eye…
 What in the world is happening?!
 Don’t tell me that he learned that Jutsu…!
 So this is the Uchiha Clan…
 Exactly…
 W-What the heck is that?!
 What a sound! What’s that technique?
 That’s just a jab…
 Huh?!
 However, it is the one used by Leaf Village’s number one technician.
 That’s the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi…
 It’s the special technique used only for assassinations…
 Its secret is in the speed of the jab,
 and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,
 the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,
 and moreover the speed of the jab makes a “chichichichichi” sound…
 A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.
 And that’s why that technique is called…
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 No way! That Gaara’s absolute protection is…
 It’s impossible…
 Don’t tell me…
 Excellent work…
 That’s…
 Kakashi’s…
 Chidori… Also known as Lightning Blade.
 Lightning Blade?
 Lightning Blade is another name for the Jutsu derived
 from Kakashi’s ability to cut through lightning using that technique.
 Huh? Cut through lightning?
 Huh? That sounds fishy…
 A-Awesome…
 The real name of that technique is Chidori…
 The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations
 and the intensity of the Chakra on his arm…
 And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing
 of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.
 But what a reckless technique…
 That’s not for you to say…
 Right, Lee?
 It’s beyond my scope of comprehension, but…
 What an awesome technique!
 I can understand it…
 If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,
 I wouldn’t make a direct jab attack on the opponent…
 Or rather, I couldn’t.
 For an opponent,
 a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.
 And moreover, I don’t have the eyes to read that counterblow.
 I envy you…Sasuke!
 When I fought you once, I said…
 Even if one understands visually,
 it’s meaningless unless one can move physically…
 I was filled with a feeling of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…
 the Sharingan!
 I caught you!
 Third Squadron. We are ready any time.
 All preparations are complete on this end too.
 Roger. Proceed with action at the signal.
 Looks like it’s almost time.
 The guy who was worrying about Sasuke until just a moment ago…
 is now jealous of him.
 Sasuke…
 This is the feeling!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I’ve gotten stronger…
 In order to become Hokage…
 In order not to lose to anyone…
 Sasuke!
 In order not to lose to you.
 I want…to fight you, too.
 But you are…
 Yeah…
 What…? This warm thing…?
 Mother…? What is…?
 Blood…my blood is…!
 D-Don’t tell me that…
 D-Don’t tell me that Gaara is hurt?!
 What is it?!
 It’s that thing’s arm!
 Darn! Doing something careless like that…
 Has the Perfect Possession happened?
 I don’t know. He seems to be injured…
 This has never happened before.
 It gives me the chills just to remember…
 When I first saw that thing, I wasn’t able to eat…
 I mean, visually it’s totally…
 What is…
 this sensation?
 He’s hurt, after all…
 The shell was broken when his body was incomplete!
 It’s different! Those aren’t the eyes!
 W-What was that… that look earlier on?!
 Huh…?
 What’s this…? I can’t see…
 Kakashi! This must be!
 Yeah…a Genjutsu!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 What’s going on…?
 Release!
 Genjutsu! ls Kabuto already moving?
 In that case, it’s just about time…
 It’s coming!
 Shall we begin?!
 It’s the signal!
 – Start the operation! – Start the operation!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump

 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 It got dark all of a sudden… it feels so good.
 I hear something in the distance.
 Sakura’s voice, Kakashi Sensei’s voice…
 Scream? I just heard something loud.
 I think I do, but… 					Sasuke…
 I got to watch his match!
 But I really don’t know what’s going on.

40,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 So it’s a case of not being able to fight with the leader

 Well then!
 Hot-Blooded Confrontation: Student vs. Sensei
 So you think you’ve blackened the path to this Might Guy’s tomorrow with this?
 Youth is breaking through the walls that close you in…
 If you have both passion and effort,  then nothing is impossible!
 With our sights trained on tomorrow…!
 Is there no tomorrow for us…?
 So this wood retains its incredible strength
 because it is reinforced and connected by Chakra, I see.
 Guy Sensei…
 Yagura?
 Are you all right?!
 I’m not Yagura…
 Eldest of the three Ryudouin brothers,  Gensho!
 Second son of the same, Rokkaku!
 Third son, Jako!
 Ryudouin?
 Hmm… I think I’ve heard of that somewhere…
 Don’t tell me that you don’t remember!
 Our father, Agira Ryudouin, was deeply injured
 by the cowardly strategies of you Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
 And unable to execute his missions, he passed away in despair.
 Our father resented you to the very end,
 even muttering your name on his deathbed…
 telling us to fight with Might Guy of Hidden Leaf Village.
 From that day forth,
 our objective has been to avenge his death!
 Yes! We have been lying in wait for the time when we could get even with you!
 Oh! Do you mean that Agira?!
 There’s no way I could forget that battle.
 Although we were enemies on our missions, Agira was a fine man…
 That will remain in my memory as a splendid contest, even within
 the annals of the complete eight-volume
 “Might Guy’s History of Famous Battles.”
 It was a man-to-man fight.
 Nothing happened that dishonored my Way of Ninja!
 You three must be mistaken.
 I won’t be angry at you, so let me out of here!
 Fool! I shall wreak vengeance upon  you to settle my father’s score…
 I’ll finish you off!
 Sakura…
 I noticed you were there some time ago.
 My master told me to make sure you don’t overdo it.
 You’re hiding something, aren’t you?!
 N-No… Nothing!
 Sakura, you’re not very good at lying…
 What?
 Die, Might Guy! Enemy of our father!
 Wait, I tell you!
 Hey, you Yagura imposter. lnfiltrating Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 what are you scheming?!
 Byakugan!
 Guy is in that building! The building is controlled by their Chakra!
 Why you--!
 Intense Brow Sensei, I’m coming to your rescue!
 Wh-What is this?!
 Do you intend to shut us in with these pieces of wood?
 Don’t underestimate us!
 Stop it, Naruto!
 Wooden Dummies for training?
 Are these also controlled by those three?
 However strong they are,
 they couldn’t move all of these Wooden Dummies at once.
 It’s hard to believe those three would have that much power.
 Byakugan!
 I see.
 They have a simple mechanism,
 and their movements are controlled by the labels stuck to the back of their heads.
 So, they’re not moved with Puppet Jutsu?
 No, they’re only designed for repeated punches and kicks,
 so they probably cannot respond to our movements!
 Does this mean their movements can be halted by removing the labels?
 So that’s what it’s all about!
 If that’s the case, then I’ll return that blow!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here goes!
 Once I know the weak spot, you’re all mine!
 – Gotcha! 					– Gotcha!
 Hah! This is easy!
 These Wooden Dummies are just one small part of our Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Wooden Dummy Manipulation Jutsu!
 Damn you!
 Keep your wits about you!
 There’s one that moves differently  from the others!
 Neji!
 U-zu-ma-ki…
 Naruto Barra--!
 Stay back!
 Some of these Wooden Dummies seem to be manipulated by the Puppet Jutsu.
 Be careful!
 – Lee! 					– Bushy Brow!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Lee?!
 How did you know we were here?!
 From what Sakura told us,
 I felt certain that Guy Sensei would take this route
 if he were headed for the Land of Mountain Streams.
 And where is Guy Sensei?
 Inside there.
 What?
 A-Are they running away?
 What’s happening?!
 It’s just like a castle!
 Leave this to me!
 Guy Sensei is my master! I would risk my life to save him!
 But, Bushy Brow, your leg injury hasn’t healed yet.
 I’m going in!
 It’s reckless!
 Do you intend to interfere?
 Today, I am just a bit different from usual--!
 Bushy Brow, we’ll cover you.
 There is a weak point in the Chakra at the center of the castle.
 If you hit there, then…
 But it may be a trap!
 Everyone… If it is a trap,  let’s try falling into it intentionally.
 Over there!
 Dynamic Entry!
 As we suspected, it was a trap to lure me in.
 Anyway, let’s follow it through.
 Rokkaku, Jako, leave the rest to me.
 All right.
 Take revenge on that coward by a suitable method.
 Leave it to me…
 Wooden Dummy: Possess: Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 A Wooden Dummy here too?
 Your teacher is an incredible liar, Lee…
 Is that Yagura’s voice I hear?
 I’ll teach you both, master and student,
 that sometimes passion and effort alone come to naught.
 I won’t allow you to speak ill of my teacher.
 If you’ve got something to say,
 then why don’t you come out here and say it?
 There is no need.
 I can amply prove it with  the Wooden Dummy that is my incarnation.
 I have come to rescue my teacher!
 There’s no way I’m going to let myself lose to you!
 You make me laugh…
 What’s this? The Leaf Hurricane…?
 Does this mean that the technique  I deployed that time
 has been completely imitated and mastered by Yagura?!
 In that case…
 Leaf's Severe Hurricane!
 Can this really be Yagura?
 If he’s mastered not only offensive moves,
 but also learned to guard with such perfection
 then he truly must be a genius!
 What an incredibly powerful spinning kick…
 The Gensho I faced off with in the practice hall
 did not have this much power.
 To my knowledge,
 there is only one person who could let loose this powerful a kick.
 They are student and teacher who respect each other.
 Dying in fighting each other must  be a wish come true.
 We’ll have them crush each other
 with Wooden Dummies mimicking each other’s movements.
 Even if each were to discover the true identity of his opponent…
 They can’t escape from the confrontation
 without defeating the Wooden Dummies before their eyes.
 That is the secret of
 Wooden Dummy: Possess: Transfer: Repossess Jutsu!
 Looks like my legs can’t last for very long…
 If it comes to this, there’s only one move left.
 Guy Sensei, it’s okay right?
 If I use it for your sake, you’ll probably forgive me.
 The Lotus?
 Could it be that the one who is controlling  this Wooden Dummy is Lee?
 Dancing Leaf Shadow!
 A combo move from the Lotus Hit Back to aerial Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
 It’s magnificent… Too magnificent!
 Only Guy Sensei could use such artful techniques!
 Splendid! If I had not been his opponent,
 I’m 100% certain that he would have toppled the opponent with that Lotus.
 But, at this rate,  I won’t be able to beat this Jutsu…
 Wait! There is a way.
 That tapping is Morse Code. “You and I are destroying each other…”
 But there’s no way for either of us to end this fight
 without defeating the enemy’s Jutsu…
 So, it was Guy Sensei that  I was fighting all along?
 We must both create an attack  with speed and power
 of a magnitude that cannot be  reproduced by the Wooden Dummies…
 “But I cannot show to you  the abyss of death again!”
 Master Guy, if I do it to protect the person  who is most important to me…
 “You will forgive me for using  that move, won’t you?
 ""To me…"" 					""To me…""
 “To me, there is no one more important than Guy Sensei,” you say?
 Lee! What do you mean by making me cry at a time like this?
 Lee! I haven’t forgotten the promise I made to you back then!
 “If you die…I shall die with you.”
 Thank you, Guy Sensei!
 Now is the very time when…
 one’s own Way of Ninja…
 – must be followed to the very end!  – must be followed to the very end!
 Third Gate: Gate of Life… Open!
 Fourth Gate: Gate of Pain… Open!
 Guy Sensei!
 We’re far from finished!
 What’s wrong, Elder Brother?
 They’re fast. They’re both too fast…
 At this rate, the Wooden Dummies will…break.
 Fifth Gate: Gate of Closing!
 Open!
 I can’t see them. They’re faster even than sound!
 There you go, Lee!
 Bring the Chakra of your passions  to bear upon your opponent!
 Right!
 – The castle is… – …crumbling?
 If this was revenge,
 then why did you not come at me with the Kung Fu techniques of Ryudoin?
 That day, though he was the only man left,
 your father refused to surrender,
 but fairly and sportingly confronted me with Kung Fu.
 Out of respect to your father, I faced him one to one.
 When the fight was finished, your father smiled slightly,
 as if satisfied, and said he would like to fight again…
 Whether or not you believe me, this is all there was to it.
 Could it be that what Father wanted to say
 was not that he wanted us to defeat Master Guy,
 but that he wanted to fight again, fairly and squarely?
 Have we had the wrong idea all along?
 I learned something important from your father in that fight.
 It is not the people born with  natural gifts who are the lucky ones;
 the truly fortunate are they who,  believing in themselves to the very end,
 can go on striving and keep the flame of their passions alive because of it.
 Uh-huh. That’s a good teacher-student relationship.
 Naruto!
 Say, Sakura! Hurry up and get Bushy Brow to Grandma’s place, will you?
 Got it! Get him to the stretcher.
 No, don’t worry about me. I’m okay. See to Yagura first.
 Speaking of which, I still haven’t asked of Yagura’s real name.
 Lee, there’ll be plenty of tim  for that later.
 Administering first-aid should take priority.
 Yes! Guy Sensei!
 Yup, yup… That is really one super teacher-student relationship.
 I wish mine was as good…
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Yo, Kiba, Neji!
 As always, you have no sense for tension.
 – What was that?! – Be quiet, you guys.
 That’s right. They are about to give us important instructions.
 – Okay… – Choji too! Can't you eat a little later?
 – I don’t mind. – That’s not the point at all!
 N-Naruto… Um… I…
 Things are heating up in here, aren't they, Sakura?
 You are getting too excited.
 Hey. We’re all here.
 Then, I’ll explain the next mission.
 Next time: “Crisis: The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather!”

41,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 He's late.
 Naruto!
 Stay still.
 Why's it that only our squad's teacher is late?
 The other squads have gone off somewhere with their new teachers,
 and Iruka Sensei's also left.
 Don't look at me.
 Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey!
 It'll be his fault because he's late.
 Man! You're asking for it!
 I like stuff like this!
 A Jonin wouldn't get caught in such a weak booby trap.
 That's right. You're such an idiot...!
 I got him, I got him...
 I-I'm sorry, sir.
 I tried to stop him, but Naruto did it on his own...
 It's all good.
 Get real. ls he really a Jonin?
 How can I put this?
 As for my first impression of you guys...?
 Well, I hate you.
 Pass or Fail: Survival Test
 Let's see.
 First off, let me have you guys introduce yourselves.
 Introduce ourselves...
 What should we say?
 Your likes, dislikes, your future dream, hobbies, things like that!
 Hey!  Before that, please tell us about yourself.
 Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.
 I don't feel like telling you guys about my likes and dislikes.
 I've never really thought about my future dream...
 As for my hobbies, I have many.
 In the end, isn't all we know his name?
 Yeah.
 Next is you guys.
 Let's start with you.
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I like instant ramen,
 but what I like even more is the ramen from Ichiraku
 that Iruka Sensei treats me to.
 What I dislike is the three minutes
 after pouring hot water in the instant ramen.
 My hobby is eating and comparing ramen!
 And my future dream...
 is to surpass the Hokage!
 And so I'm going to get the entire village
 to acknowledge my existence!
 I see...
 this kid's grown up in an interesting way.
 Okay, next.
 I'm Sakura Haruno.
 What I like... I mean, who I like is...
 And, my hobby is, 					I mean...
 My future dream is...
 And? What about your dislikes?
 Naruto!
 Girls at her age are probably more interested in love
 than the Ninja Arts.
 And lastly.
 My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.
 I have lots of dislikes, but no likes in particular.
 Oh...
 And...
 I don't feel like summing up my ambition as just a dream
 but I do have an ambition!
 The ambition to restore my clan and without fail...
 to kill a certain man!
 He doesn't...
 mean me, does he?
 Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.
 I knew it...
 Good!
 The three of you are very distinctive and interesting!
 We'll have a mission tomorrow!
 Yes, sir! What kind of mission?
 First, we'll do what we can do with just four people.
 What-what-what?!
 A survival exercise.
 Survival exercise?
 Why are we doing an exercise
 even though this is supposed to be a mission?
 We've had more than our share of exercises in the Academy!
 This is no simple exercise.
 Then... then what kind of exercise is it?
 Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?
 Uh, well, if I tell you, I know you'll grow disenchanted.
 What?
 Of the twenty-seven graduates,
 only nine will be recognized as junior ninjas.
 The remaining eighteen will be sent back to the Academy.
 In other words, this exercise is an extremely difficult test
 with a failure rate of 66% or higher!
 See, see?
 You got disenchanted!
 That's crazy!
 To have suffered that much!
 T-Then, what was the graduation test for?
 Oh, that.
 It was just to select those who have the potential of becoming Genin.
 Whaaaat?!
 Well, that's the way it is.
 I'll be determining whether you pass or fail.
 Bring your complete set of Ninja tools!
 We meet at five in the morning.
 N-No way am I going to be dropped now!
 I've got to have my strength recognized for real.
 I'll be separated from Sasuke if I fail this test.
 This is an exercise of love!
 Okay! You're dismissed.
 Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.
 You'll throw up.
 Morning.
 Hi, folks. Good morning!
 You're late!
 Well, a black cat crossed my path, you see.
 Ahem! Oh well...
 Okay, it's set for 12:00!
 Today's assignment is to take these bells away from me by noon.
 Those who can't do it won't get lunch.
 They'll be tied to that...
 and I'll eat my lunch before your very eyes.
 So that was the point...
 for us not to eat breakfast...
 But, hold on.
 Why are there only two bells?
 There are only two, so at the very least,
 one will have to go to the logs.
 That person will be disqualified for failing the mission...
 and will return to the Academy.
 It might be one person at the very least,
 or it could be all three of you.
 You can use your Shuriken.
 You won't be able to take the bells unless you come with the intent to kill me.
 But, that's dangerous, sir!
 Y-Yeah, that's right!
 You couldn't even evade a chalkboard eraser!
 In this world,
 those who aren't skilled enough tend to complain more.
 Well, just ignore the loser...
 Begin when I give the ""ready-go"" signal.
 Loser, loser, loser.
 Don't be so hasty. I didn't say start, yet.
 No way...!
 I didn't see him at all.
 So this is a Jonin.
 But, that's fine.
 At least you came with  the intent to kill me.
 How can I put this...?
 I feel like I'm finally starting...
 to like you guys.
 We're going to start.
 Ready... start!
 What do you want to know?
 I didn't think you just came here to drink tea.
 The Jonin in Naruto and company's Group Seven...
 What kind of teacher is he? ls he strict?
 You mean Kakashi? Does he concern you?
 I heard a rumor that concerns me.
 What's this?
 It's a pass-fail list of the junior ninjas
 Kakashi has been in charge of up until now.
 Let me have a look.
 T-This is...!
 Fundamentally, ninja must mask their presence and hide.
 Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...
 Alright! Let's face off fair and square!
 Oh?
 That goof.
 Say, aren't you a bit off kilter?
 What's off kilter is your hairstyle!
 I'll teach you the first Shinobi Battle Jutsu...
 Taijutsu.
 Taijutsu...?
 That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...
 That being said... he's going to use weapons?
 Make-Out Paradise
 What's the matter?
 Why don't you come at me?
 But hey... what's with the book?
 Why do you ask...?
 It's because I was curious about what happens next.
 Don't worry.
 With you guys as opponents,
 it makes no difference if I'm reading or not.
 I'm going to rip you apart!
 Darn! This time a spin kick!
 Man!
 Wha--?!
 Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind multiple times, fool.
 The way his hands are positioned...
 Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!
 No way!
 With Naruto as his opponent,
 that's too strong a Ninjutsu no matter how you look at it.
 That Sign... lt's a fire-style skill.
 That idiot teacher's doing more than just running around?
 Naruto, get out of there quick!
 You'll die!
 Too late.
 Leaf Village Secret! Ultimate Taijutsu!
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.
 Those two are idiots.
 Alright...
 Even so, isn't that against the rules?
 What're we supposed to do about his strength?
 Darn it!
 It wasn't supposed to be like this.
 It... can't be!
 This is more than just a rumor.
 Kakashi's test might be a bit difficult...
 Even so, this means absolutely no one has passed...!
 That's right...
 Kakashi has never had someone pass.
 They have all...
 been annihilated...
 What's the matter?
 You won't get lunch if you can't take the bell by noon.
 I know that, I say.
 You're not very energetic,
 considering you said that you'd surpass the Hokage.
 Darn it! Darn it! I can fight even if I'm hungry.
 I didn't even have dinner last night.
 I shouldn't have gone on a diet.
 I just got a bit careless earlier!
 Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...
 But... I've got to take the bell, no matter what.
 No matter what...
 I'm... not...
 turning back now!
 I'm going to become a Ninja!
 Security is your greatest enemy!
 Now for my favorite Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Seven... Narutos?
 What? They're not just images?
 Are they all real? The real thing?
 Not the clone, but the shadow clone, eh.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!
 Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Those aren't just images but actual clones!
 That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 It's the forbidden Jutsu that did in Mizuki.
 Judging from your ability,
 that Jutsu should have a one-minute limit.
 Even if you talk trash,
 Naruto is Naruto after all is said and done...
 You still can't beat me with that skill.
 W-What?! Behind me?!
 Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them from behind.
 Right, Kakashi Sensei?
 Using the Shadow Clone,
 I had one of them come up
 from the bottom of the river and sneak behind you!
 Here's one for that attack on my butt earlier!
 Naruto, not bad!
 So... a diversionary tactic, eh?
 Now... allow me to punch you!
 What?!
 The one who got punched was...
 Naruto?
 Ouch!
 You...!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!
 You used the Transformation Jutsu to change yourself, didn't you?!
 It's you!
 You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.
 You smell like Kakashi Sensei!
 The smell of an old guy!
 Why you--!
 Hey! For the time being, let's try undoing the Jutsu.
 If we do that, only the two will remain... so...
 You should've realized that sooner, you idiot!
 You're me, you idiot! Just undo the Jutsu!
 Naruto...
 You're embarrassing to watch...
 That was the Substitution Jutsu, you fool.
 Essentially, it's a skill used to quickly switch one's own body
 with an object or animal.
 This makes your enemy think you're being attacked,
 but then you strike during their unguarded moment.
 After letting himself get caught by the real Naruto,
 the Jonin fool switched bodies with one of the clone Narutos.
 Not only did he make Naruto think he'd been nailed...
 he used Naruto's own attack on him.
 A bell?!
 You really must have been in a hurry.
 You've dropped a bell!
 What the heck is this?!
 Of course it's a trap...
 H-H-Hey!
 That jonin doesn't lower his guard even when he's fighting Naruto.
 The bell!
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also...
 ...don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must see through deception!
 I know that, I say!
 You know, I'm telling you because you don't get it.
 Listen up!
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke!
 You're overdoing it!
 Darn it!
 At this rate, there's no way I can beat Kakashi Sensei.
 But if I don't take the bell...
 I won't get lunch...
 No... I'll fail the test!
 He says a Ninja must see through deception,
 but I have no idea what that means.
 How in the world can I take the bell back
 from Kakashi Sensei?!

42,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 It's unforgivable!
 Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
 Their feelings towards the clan are the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the Fuma’s feelings of wanting to restore their clan…
 I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what!
 Pure Terror                          The House of Orochimaru
 How did the Pervy Sage,
 who was once so easily defeated by Old Lady Tsunade’s numbing medicine
 detect Sasame’s medicine this time?
 Isn’t it strange that Master Jiraiya’s that sharp?
 Hey, hey…
 Remember when Sasame talked about Hanzaki and said he’s a traitor?
 That’s how I knew…
 Hanzaki told me everything…
 When Orochimaru came to this land, there were those among us
 who wanted to use his strength to revive the clan
 and those that saw his evil intent and said we should not join him.
 Hmm… so that’s why you guys were chased out of your village.
 Yes. It was probably Orochimaru’s idea we were chased out of our village
 as traitors who were getting in the way of a revival of the clan.
 When Sasame called Hanzaki a traitor,
 I knew that Sasame had ties to a group that was on Orochimaru’s side.
 Fool!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Just wait a minute!
 I’m prepared!
 Sasame, you did it so that you could meet Arashi… Isn't that so?
 I’m sorry… that was the only thing I could do.
 Master Jiraiya!
 Sasame did it only because she wanted to see her cousin.
 Please forgive her!
 I’m asking you to forgive her too!
 The law of the Shinobi is a strict thing…
 I can’t just acquit her like this.
 Then punish me first!
 I promised I’d help Sasame see her cousin Arashi!
 If I don’t fulfill that I’ll have twisted my Way of Ninja!
 Master Jiraiya, me too!
 Now now, wait a minute! lt’s not as if I’m gonna eat her alive.
 – Huh?! 					– Oh?
 Sasame, Hanzaki was worried that
 you might leave your village to look for Arashi…
 After you escort us to Orochimaru’s hideout,
 you’ll immediately head to the inn where Hanzaki is
 and wait there for our return.
 That is the punishment given to you.
 Master Jiraiya…
 Pervy Sage, I’ve gotta give you more credit!
 Thank you, Master Jiraiya!
 Well, Hanzaki treated me to a lot of special service at the Fuma Bar
 and asked me to look after Sasame…
 I thought it was something like that anyway!
 I feel cheated that I gave you more credit!
 He, hey… lt’s all right once in a while, right?
 There’s something called socializing for adults…
 There it is….
 Leave the rest to us.
 Sasame, be careful going back to the inn.
 Don’t worry! I will absolutely bring Arashi back!
 Please take care of Arashi!
 Leave it to me!
 Just wait, and rest assured that I’ll do everything I can!
 Stop getting so carried away Naruto, you idiot!
 Oww!
 That’s where…
 Sasuke is…!
 So this is the only entrance…
 If they’re lying in wait, we’ll be picked off.
 But there’s nothing we can do but go!
 Well, don’t panic.
 If three large rats go, we’ll stand out.
 First, let’s send out one that won’t stand out.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Hey!
 Th-The frog spoke!
 Hey, it’s been a while! Sakura, this is Gamakichi.
 Gamakichi?!
 I wanted to ask you to do some reconnaissance.
 All right! That’s a simple task. Leave it to me!
 I can’t help it, frogs give me the creeps …
 There doesn’t seem to be anything fishy…
 There doesn’t seem to be a trap at the entrance.
 Arashi…
 There’s nothing to it around here.
 Hmm…
 What shall we do?
 It seems there’s no choice but to split up into three.
 My instinct tells me it’s the middle one!
 Wait!
 What the heck?!
 At times like this, it’s especially important to move carefully…
 All right, I’ll go this way!
 That’s it?!
 So what’s so different from my instinct and that, Pervy Sage?
 Well, it’s a question of feeling…
 If you haven’t found anything after 30 minutes, come back.
 Got it?
 Yeah…
 Naruto, Sakura, the two of you should proceed together.
 Listen, from this point forward, it’s the first avenue of hell.
 A demon might appear, or a snake might appear.
 Take them on mindfully!
 Yup!
 I understand!
 We’re going down the middle!
 Then I’m going this way…
 See ya …
 Hmm…the smell of face powder.
 I’m being invited in…
 In that case, it might be good fun to accept the invitation.
 What…?
 Because guests would be arriving from far away,
 I was directed by Lord Orochimaru to entertain.
 I’m guessing it's a type of fox raccoon ghost…
 If you’re saying I’m some raccoon or fox,
 you ought to come over here and check to see if I have a tail or not.
 Oh, this path was right on…
 How about yours, Naruto?
 Sakura, be careful!
 There’s no telling what sort of traps there might be…
 Yeah…
 – Oh?! 					– Naruto?!
 And you were the one who said to be careful!
 It was an ingenious trap floor!
 Oh!
 What the hell is next!
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 It’s my fault…
 Naruto!
 What the hell…
 I can’t get out…
 What’re you doing?!
 You screamed in such a misleading way, I totally thought…
 Give me a hand!
 You’re really a handful!
 Ya saved me…
 Really! I’ll go first!
 Naruto…
 It’s all right now.
 Here!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Sakura…
 Naruto?! Are you all right?
 Don’t worry about me.
 You need to hurry and get out of this trap hallway!
 But…
 I said go! I’ll follow behind for sure!
 Really?
 Yeah… I’ll catch up in no time!
 You’d better come, no matter what.
 It’s a promise, you know…
 The sake doesn’t seem tampered with.
 So what kind of plot has been prepared…?
 Just as I’d expect from the Village Hidden in Sound…
 Are you planning to put a Jutsu on me using music?
 The music isn’t only for guests. lt’s for myself…
 I see…
 What do you play for your heart?
 Music for my own funeral…
 Trying to seduce me…. You’ve underestimated this Jiraiya!
 Escorting the guest to the underworld is my last mission.
 A suspended ceiling?!
 I need to hurry up and get out of this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is torture!
 What the hell?!
 Give me a hand!
 We need to build up our Chakra and create the Rasengan!
 Don’t be absurd!
 We can’t stretch our bodies beyond this!
 My muscles are cramping up!
 Man! I’ve gotta do something…
 – What! 					– Huh?!
 What?!
 – Water?! 					– Water!
 Looks like I’ve been saved.
 Hey, get outta my way!
 Oh, it’s you, Naruto.
 Gamakichi, is there a way out somewhere?
 Don’t know! I was flushed down here too.
 So it’s no good…
 Hey, are you all right?
 How could I be all right!
 Naruto’s taking a long time.
 Maybe I should go back…
 It's admirable that you made it this far, Sakura.
 Is that Kabuto’s voice?!
 Isn’t it ironic?
 During the Chunin Exam in the Village Hidden in the Leaves,
 you were the only one that dragged the team down,
 but yet you’re the one to make it this far.
 I’m not by myself!
 Naruto and Master Jiraiya will be here right away!
 Where’s Sasuke? He is all right, isn’t he?
 Shouldn’t you be worried about Naruto and Master Jiraiya,
 and not Sasuke?
 Well, it may very well be that those two are no longer in this world anymore.
 No way…
 There’s no way Master Jiraiya and Naruto would be taken down that easily!
 I wonder if that’s so?
 Maybe you dragged Naruto down like you always do?
 So I’m right …
 Naruto…
 If you’re worried you should go and see…
 Or perhaps you’re afraid of me attacking
 and you can’t come out from behind the pillar.
 If someone like you were on my team,
 I don’t know how many lives I would need.
 I can too…
 I can too!
 Substitution Jutsu?!
 Substitution again?!
 I can too… When I fight, I fight!
 As I thought, this is all you’ve got…
 It’s about time I put an end to this.
 I can’t keep Lord Orochimaru waiting for no reason any longer, you see.
 Orochimaru?!
 Now…shall we see…
 just who will be stealing scrolls from whom?
 We’ll fight to the death!
 No! I’m different from how I was…then!
 I wonder if that’s true…
 It can’t be…
 Even if you put up a bluff, I can foresee …
 You are already…finished.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 I’m scared. What is this intimidating feeling?
 My legs are weak and I don’t have any strength in my body.
 I thought I’m not the same person as I was in the past.
 I must stop. Calm down.
 These guys are here, which means Sasuke is definitely here!
 I need to fight! I came here to save Sasuke!

 Wooow! 					 It's huge!
 H-Hey! 					Please keep it down.
 I took this boat out under cover of fog.
 And I cut the engine and am rowing by hand.
 If they find us, we'll be in deep trouble.
 Mr. Tazuna.
 I want to ask you something before we arrive at the pier.
 The identity of your assailants, and the reason why they are after you.
 If you don't tell us…

 It appears I have no choice but to tell you.
 Frankly, I'd like you to listen.

 Who?
 You guys have probably heard at  least his name before.
 A shipping magnate by the name of Gato.
 What? Gato…of the Gato Company?
 One of the world's richest men?
 Who? What?
 Yes…
 On the surface, he's the chief executive of a shipping company…
 But underneath, he is into drug-trafficking
 and deals in contraband using gangs and Ninjas.
 Moreover, he runs a despicable business,
 ruthlessly taking over nations and enterprises.
 It was about one year ago…
 when that man first set his eyes on the Land of the Waves…
 He used his wealth and violence to enter this country,
 and before anyone knew it,
 he had taken complete control of the island's maritime transportation and shipping.
 Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an island nation like the Land of the Waves,
 means having control of finance, the government, the people... everything.
 The one thing Gato fears...
 is the completion of the bridge...
 that has been under construction for some time now.
 I see.
 Since you're the one building the bridge, you've become a hindrance.
 Then, those Ninjas from before were Gato's men…?
 But I don't understand.
 Your opponent is a dangerous one,  who will even use Ninja.
 Why did you hide that fact from us when you made your request?
 The Land of the Waves…
 is a very poor nation, and even feudal lords have no money.
 Of course, we ordinary citizens have no money either.
 We cannot afford to make requests of Rank B or higher...
 Well, if you pull out of the mission when I land ashore,
 I will, no doubt, be killed.
 Killed sometime before I make it home.
 But there's no need for concern!
 Should I die, my cute grandchild who will turn eight...
 will only cry his heart out!
 Oh!
 And... my daughter will only blame the Hidden Leaves Ninja
 for the rest of her life and grieve in solitude!
 Oh, it's not your fault at all!
 Well...
 I guess we have no choice.
 Let's continue as his bodyguards.
 Oh! I am most grateful!
 I won!
 We'll be arriving soon.
 Tazuna.
 It appears we haven't been noticed up until this point…
 Thanks.
 This is as far as I go.
 See you around.
 Yeah. You've been a big help.
 Be careful.
 Okay!
 Get me home safely.
 Right.
 When they next attack, it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.
 Cripes!
 I won't let this guy do all the fun stuff anymore!
 There!
 Heh… Just a mouse.
 Quit trying to show off!
 There was nothing there  in the first place!
 Please, Naruto.
 Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.
 They're really dangerous.
 Hey brat! Don't be doing anything confusing!
 Huh? I sense a presence there!
 No, over here?!
 There!
 Stop it, already!
 S-Someone's really been targeting us  the whole time!
 Yeah right!
 Knock it off, you!
 Naruto! What have you done?!
 It's a bunny!
 I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to… I'm sorry, bunny.
 It's just a rabbit, eh.
 That's a snow rabbit.
 But that doesn't explain its fur color...
 The coat turns white only during winter when there is little sunlight.
 Which means...
 that snow rabbit was raised indoors without sunlight to be used as a substitution.
 Guess they're already here…
 I'm sorry…
 I see… The Demon Brothers wouldn't be enough to take on these guys.
 The Copy Ninja from the Village of the Hidden Leaves.
 ""Sharingan"" Kakashi is with them…
 Everyone, get down!
 If I'm not mistaken, he's…
 Here we go!
 Here we go, here we go, here we go!
 I'm going to do it this time.
 I won't lose to Sasuke!
 Well, well.
 If it isn't the Rogue Ninja of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!
 Rogue Ninja? Whatever. What's important now is…
 Ready…
 Go!
 You're in the way.
 Get back, you guys.
 Why?!
 He's on a totally different level from the guys from the other day.
 His being our opponent means…
 Huh?
 Oh.
 that things might be tricky as I am now.
 I assume you are Kakashi, the Sharingan user…
 Sorry, but…
 I'll have you hand over the old man.
 Huh? Huh? Sharingan? What's that?
 What? What is he talking about?
 Is this guy strong?
 Sharingan…
 Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.
 Protect Tazuna…
 Don't involve yourselves in the fight.
 Huh?
 That's the teamwork in this situation.
 Huh?!
 Fight me.
 W-What's this eye…?
 Well now...
 I never expected to see the rumored Sharingan this soon…
 This is an honor.
 Everyone's been saying Sharingan...
 What is it?!
 …Sharingan.
 Power that the light of the eye generates, and the pupil emanates.
 The user of the so-called Visual Jutsu (Art)
 is said to possess the vision to see through all Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),
 Taijutsu (Physical Art), and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),
 and is able to deflect them.
 The Sharingan is a type of eye that is unique
 to the user of the Visual Art.
 However, that is not the only power of the Sharingan.
 Well said.
 That is not all.
 What's more frightening is that such an eye
 can assess an opponent's techniques and copy them.
 When I was in the Anbu Black Ops of the Hidden Mist,
 search information about you was in the Bingo Book
 I would carry around with me.
 There was also something else in the book...
 About the man who has copied over one thousand skills…
 Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 What? Kakashi Sensei is that incredible a Ninja?
 W-Wow!
 What does this mean?
 The Sharingan…is a special trait
 that appears in only a select few even among the Uchiha clan.
 Could it be, that this guy…
 Let's end the talking here.
 I must kill that old man immediately.
 But, Kakashi, it seems I have to defeat you first.
 Over there!
 And he's even on the water?
 He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.
 He's vanished?!
 Sensei!
 He'll probably come to erase me first…
 What is he?
 Zabuza Momochi.
 He's a Anbu Black Ops member in the Hidden Mist and
 is known as ""the silent killing"" technique expert.
 S-Silen...?
 As the name suggests…
 it's a killing skill that's implemented in an instant in silence.
 By the time you realize it,
 it's possible you may find yourself in the afterlife.
 I haven't totally mastered the use of my Sharingan.
 So don't lower your guard, you guys.
 Well, if we fail, we'll only die.
 How can you be so carefree?!
 The mist is steadily getting thicker!
 The Land of the Waves is surrounded by ocean.
 So mist rises very easily.
 Sensei!
 Eight spots.
 Huh? What?
 The larynx, the spine, the lungs, the liver...
 The jugular and the subclavian veins.
 The kidneys, the heart.
 Now then, which vulnerable spot would be good?
 What an intense thirst for blood!
 If I take even one breath, or move my eyes,
 I will be marked and killed - that's what I'm feeling.
 If I'm stuck like this for an hour, I'll go mad!
 Facing a Jonin's intent to kill…
 This sensation is like having my life being held in limbo…
 No way! I'd rather die to escape this feeling!
 Sasuke.
 Don't worry. I'll protect you with my life.
 I will not allow my comrades to get killed.
 I wonder about that...
 It's over.
 Sensei! 					Behind you!
 Die!
 The Water Clone Jutsu?
 It can't be!
 In this mist…
 did he actually copy me?
 Don't move.
 It's over.
 O-Oh no!
 Even Kakashi Sensei fell under Zabuza's Jutsu.
 I've got to escape.
 I'll get killed, for real.
 This pain.
 What am I doing?!
 I'd decided, hadn't I? Not to run away no matter what happens.
 Next episode:  ""The Oath of Pain!""
 I'm going to kick butt once again!

44,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Where’s Naruto?
 It’s no good. I can’t find him.
 I see…
 He’s not close by anymore.
 Either he drifted away…
 or he has escaped.
 At any rate, with this fog…
 There’s no reason to remain here any longer.
 Let’s make it to a shore nearby and start again.
 Understood.
 The Closed Door
 It’s been a while, Lord Orochimaru.
 It truly has.
 To think I’d stop by on a whim to find you still here.
 And it’s for that reason that I am able to meet with you again.
 So does the fact that you’re here mean
 you're still continuing that research?
 Yes.
 And I think someday it will be of help to you, Lord Orochimaru…
 I wonder if that’s true.
 And all this is due to my loyalty.
 Do whatever you like…
 Thank you.
 By the way…
 is he the one you were talking of earlier?
 Yes, he’s Itachi Uchiha’s younger brother.
 Oh really…
 Yes, my…
 Please don’t…
 say anything unnecessary!
 It appears that Naruto is no longer close by.
 Hey…
 Naruto, surely he’s safe, isn’t he…?
 He can’t be beaten that easily.
 After all, he too is a Leaf Shinobi…
 Shiragiku Inn 		 I’m responsible for guarding 		the ships collecting funds.
 I’m Hitode.
 I know the circumstances,
 your colleague has disappeared and I’m sure that you’re worried…
 Have you received any information since then?
 I’m sorry, but there’s been no information
 regarding a victim rescued from a shipwreck.
 I see.
 However, I'm troubled.
 This is difficult to say,
 but the departure of the collection ships has been pushed forward…
 Pushed forward?
 Now we’re scheduled to leave tomorrow morning.
 We apologize for our late notice.
 As expected, a large number of people find
 the relationship with Land of Water very important
 and we had to push the departure forward.
 I understand.
 But we’d like to take time here
 to seek and investigate our colleague…
 Of course.
 We’ll meet you directly at the port tomorrow
 for the guard duty.
 Thank you for cooperating.
 Just one thing.
 Yes…
 As you can see, we are not a very wealthy country.
 Fishermen and we are both concerned
 about the disturbance of this Demon of the Ocean.
 We greatly appreciate for your help with our country.
 I understand.
 That’s right, I…
 You’ve come to?
 Y-Yeah…
 Hey, you’re the girl from yesterday…!
 I get it now!
 You saved me, thank you!
 It just happened…
 No, seriously you saved me.
 Oh, I’m Naruto Uzumaki. What’s your name?
 Isaribi.
 So Isaribi, you’re the girl who saved my life.
 Why did you come to this remote area?
 A mission, of course!
 To exterminate the Demon of the Ocean that has been troubling this country!
 It would be best to quit.
 You won't get away easily if you get involved with the Demon of the Ocean.
 You don't need to worry. Anyway, this is a mission.
 We were careless yesterday,
 but next time we’ll catch that Demon of the Ocean--!
 That’s hot!
 So…you feel fine now?
 Yep! Thanks to you, it’s excellent, believe it!
 Then, once you’ve eaten that, get out.
 Huh?
 What? What?
 Wait, Isaribi!
 Hey!
 Isaribi… Wait…
 Huh, wha--?
 Monster! Go away!
 What’s this?
 It’s the work of some brats from the village.
 If I let it bother me, there’s no end to it.
 Oh, Isaribi…
 Really, thank you so much.
 She’s out, the monster!
 What the…?
 Get out of here!
 You’re bad luck
 Take this!
 I-Isaribi…
 Stop it, brats!
 – Disappear! – Get out of here!
 Say something!
 Hey, stop! All of you!
 You’re taking your pranks a little too far!
 Who are you?! A friend of this monster?!
 Monster?
 Everyone’s saying it.
 Isaribi was spirited away
 and became friends with the Demon of the Ocean!
 Don’t say such irresponsible things!
 It’s true!
 Ouch!
 – Run! 					– Stupid guy!
 – Hey! Who you calling stupid?! – Stop!
 What?! But…
 It’s okay…
 Leave me alone.
 I can’t leave you alone!
 If they keep doing that…
 I’m saying that it’s none of your business!
 I’m the girl who was spirited away.
 So it’s natural that people find me creepy.
 But that’s not your fault!
 That doesn’t matter.
 Humans don’t let those who are different from them
 into their group.
 So…
 Your colleague was lost at sea…
 We thought that if a boat left port between the evening and morning
 maybe they saw something…
 Sorry, but I don’t think I can help.
 Because of the Demon of the Ocean,
 people of this village stay away from the port at those times.
 I see.
 He’s been spirited away.
 That Demon of the Ocean took someone away again.
 Mother, don’t say such reckless things.
 Spirited away…
 I heard that at the port, too.
 Can you give me details about this spiriting away?
 What good will talking about it do?
 But…
 Please forgive me.
 This isn’t something to be talked about with outsiders.
 Can we do something about that, please?
 We came here to exterminate the Demon of the Ocean.
 Exterminate the Demon of the Ocean?
 I see…
 For a long time,
 there’s been a legend among fishermen on Demon Island.
 A legend?
 Yes, the legend says don’t come near Demon Island,
 “the island where demons live.”
 Demon Island has always been a fishing area rich in fish,
 but there were many hidden reefs and it was a dangerous marine area…
 So everybody obeyed the legend.
 But one unusually cool summer about ten years ago,
 the fish disappeared from the sea…
 We couldn’t help it,
 so my husband and I set our feet into the dangerous marine area.
 It was a large catch.
 But when I happily came to the surface of the ocean,
 I saw an empty boat with my husband nowhere to be seen.
 Ever since then, one after the next,
 anyone who approaches that island disappeared.
 Also, people who went to search didn’t return.
 Since then people from the village stay away from the island
 where spiriting away occurs.
 An island nobody goes near…
 That’s a peculiar story.
 Speaking of which, I heard that
 there’s a girl who returned from being spirited away.
 Oh, yes… Isaribi.
 Ma’am, I’ve got another favor.
 Please tell me where she lives!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Yes?
 Geez. Here’s the data you requested.
 That’s the Land of Sea’s…
 You’re worried, after all.
 Hm… Well, yes…
 The Land of Sea is where Anko, abandoned by Orochimaru, was found…
 Hey! Are you okay!
 It’s no good… I can’t remember.
 Even though I should know…
 It’s dark and cold…
 I was in pain… But…
 Calm down… Try taking a little more time.
 I’m sure I even got this strange mark while there…
 The suggestion is deep.
 Her entire memory is most likely all…
 That’s enough… You’ve had some tough times.
 It’s okay.
 Right now, we’ll treat this Curse Mark that’s eating away at you…
 We have to do that first.
 Lord Hokage…
 I…
 In the end, her memory didn’t return…
 A part of Anko’s memory remains lost even now.
 So that’s what happened…
 So, this is the first time Anko’s been to the Land of Sea since that incident?
 Yes… That’s right.
 It would be nice if it could be a catalyst
 for bringing back her memories…
 What?!
 Missed each other?!
 They came here?!
 Yeah, you should follow them right away!
 And, which way did they go?
 That way!
 That’s the direction I came!
 Damn! Everybody wait up!
 The collection ship is moving.
 I see, the only girl who returned from being spirited away.
 I thought we should at least go see…
 She may have some information about Demon Island!
 Stop!
 Oh! That girl!
 Sensei!
 I wonder where she intends to go?
 She’s cautious.
 Let’s follow without being noticed.
 Hey, everybody! Oh, c’mon.
 If I keep going like this,
 I'll go all the way to lsaribi's house again.
 That appearance…
 It can’t be, you’re the Demon of the Ocean…?
 What?!
 I won’t let you escape!
 Master Orochimaru… This is…?
 I’m going to teach you something special.
 This is one of the rooms where I develop Jutsu…
 I’d like you to help, too.
 But…if the village knew about this…
 It’s not going as smoothly as I hoped.
 It only needs one more step…
 Silly, there’s nothing to be afraid of.
 The really frightening thing is to neglect pursuing the truth.
 That girl, could she be…?
 Give it up! You can’t escape!
 You were the Demon of the Ocean!
 Hey, everyone!
 Hey!
 I finally found you!
 Naruto, you’re safe…
 But Naruto, you’re too late.
 Too late?
 We caught the Demon of the Ocean! Look, this is it.
 Oh! Oh?
 Huh, so this is the Demon of the Ocean?!
 Isaribi…
 Huh?!
 Isaribi… You’re Isaribi, aren’t you?!
 Naruto! What are you talking about?!
 Just wait! Isaribi! lsaribi, answer me!
 Damn it!
 Wait up, you!
 Wait, don’t be rough.
 Explanation must wait.
 We’re in trouble if we let her escape here.
 Who are you?! Give Isaribi back!
 Like that will happen!
 She's an important guinea pig.
 If she's lost, I'm responsible for it.
 Bastard!
 Don’t chase too far… lt’ll be yesterday all over again.
 But!
 Crap!
 No question about it…
 That girl…
 Sensei!
 What in the world is going on?!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Geez! What the heck are you thinking?!
 What do you intend to do alone?!
 But I can’t just leave her be!
 Even if you were to go after her,
 you don’t even have any leads in the first place!
 No, not quite!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 It seems there’s an island at the center of this land’s spiriting away.
 I get it. Demon Island!
 Let’s go after her! As for me, I can’t just leave her be, believe it!

 You bet we'll find her and bring her right away!
 Naruto! I like kids with guts like you! I'm going to give this to you!
 This made Lee stronger…
 Huh?! What ?! What?!
 This is it!
 Wow!
 They're breathable and moisture-wicking,
 and perfectly designed for free movement, all in a beautiful, stylish package.
 You'll notice a difference immediately if you train with them on!
 They're going to grow on you!
 Before long, you'll be wanting to wear them all the time like Lee!
 Of course, I have a thing for them, too!
 Woooow!
 Why couldn’t you bring a mirror or something
 instead of carrying around those things, you dork!
 Do you think they'll look good on me?
 Don't even think about it. Get a load of that…
 Now that is truly dorky.
 Okay! This is the place!
 Here?!
 The gambling house frequented by the entire town…
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 What's wrong?
 Pervy Sage… Why are they after me?
 You know, don't you, Pervert Sage? Tell me why…
 They're not really after you… They're after what's inside of you.
 What on earth is this thing?
 It's a horrible demon that attacked Leaf Village, right?
 And was dreaded by all.
 So why do they want it so much?
 Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox is a demon
 that appears at each critical juncture throughout the ages
 destroying everything in its path…
 And people feared it like an act of nature.
 The reason they want that thing… for what purpose.
 Honestly, I can't quite say.
 Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox is sealed up inside of you…
 they might be thinking they want that power in their control.
 It must be harsh to know
 that Ninja like them would keep coming after you…
 But well, that's your destiny!
 Now don’t you worry, I'm going to protect--
 Then there's nothing to do but hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!
 Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,
 have her save Sasuke and get down to some serious training!
 That's just like this kid…
 A New Training Begins: I Will Be Strong!
 Th-This place has the highest antes…!
 Don't go fretting over every little thing!
 Let's go!
 Oh dear! Please wait!
 Hmm?
 What?
 The beautiful woman you want to ""research"" on…
 That's this Tsunade person?
 Whoa! That’s sharp coming from you! And what about it?
 She's part of the Sannin thing like you, right, Pervy Sage?
 Yes, and what of it?
 How…old is she?
 My age.
 Heck, she's an old lady.
 Yikes!
 Huh?!
 Th-This woman is…!
 Would you mind changing all of this money into chips for me?
 Oh no! She's really going for it!
 Just who is this? This lady…
 You don't know?
 She's that woman with the famous alias…
 Famous alias…?
 So, well…what kind of person is this Tsunade like?
 Oh, you want to know?
 Yeah.
 Let's see…
 Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.
 Besides that, she's a diehard gambler and her face is known far and wide for it.
 Then we should have no problems finding her!
 If she's that famous!
 She's famous, all right… Legendary, you might say…
 Boss, what's this alias…?
 The Legendary…
 Legendary…?
 Oh dear! They're all laughing!
 – Legendary… 					– Legendary…
 Sitting Duck!
 Yup! But no matter how famous Legendary Sitting Duck is,
 I doubt we'll find her right away.
 Why not?!
 She hates growing old so much
 she's probably used some special Jutsu to change her appearance.
 She's actually 50 years old,
 but no doubt she looks like she did when she was 20…
 And not just that, recently I heard that…
 she transforms into her teens or 30s or 40s as the situation calls for
 to escape moneylenders.
 What?! That's a horrible thing to do!
 Tsunade has always loved to gamble more than anything
 But she has terrible luck and no skill.
 She was always being played for the Sitting Duck and the name stuck…
 Then she was always borrowing money and skipping out on her debts, too…
 Ah, it brings back memories.
 This is no time to be getting all nostalgic!
 Tell me, how do you propose we go about finding her?!
 Well…
 We may very well have to put our noses to the ground,
 but we're not without our little tricks.
 What?! So you have no idea how long it's gong to take?!
 We won't be wasting any time.
 All of our time on the road will be your time.
 My time?
 Time to make you strong… Training!
 Okay!
 No, no… I told you that is definitely out.
 I won't be seen walking with someone dressed like that.
 Come on, Pervy Sage! Let's hurry up and start training!
 Now now, don't get ahead of yourself…
 The training won't mean anything
 unless it's done in the process of gathering information on Tsunade.
 Huh? Gathering information…?
 In this town.
 Wow!
 Cool! This is my first time for this kind of thing!
 Down time is important, too!
 You go have yourself some fun before we start training.
 The festival should continue for some time.
 We'll stay here in this city for the duration.
 We'll train here, too!
 All right!
 Whoa! That's a fat wallet! You're rich!
 I have quite a bit!
 I've saved it little by little throughout my missions.
 Well then!
 – Wait! Naruto! 					– Huh?
 I'll hold on to your wallet for you!
 Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
 You can spend this much…
 What?! Only 300 ryo!
 No complaints!
 Remember Shinobi must honor the "" Shinobi’s Three Taboos""!
 Shinobi’s Three Taboos…? What's that?
 What?! You don't know!
 The ""three taboos"" are the three temptations
 that will bring Shinobi to ruin!
 The three temptations are booze, women and money…
 Oh, then this doesn't really apply to me all that much!
 I'm minor, so I can't drink yet! I don't quite get the women thing!
 And I worked so hard to save all that money,
 I don't really feel much like using it…
 You fool! Don't you underestimate the desire for money!
 Once you start using it, it goes really fast!
 Money has a frightful power.
 This Tsunade we are going to be looking for
 has ruined herself over it!
 Your desire for women is always  getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!
 I'm going on an information-gathering mission!
 Here, you hold on to my bag for me!
 If you get lost,
 my tracking SummonsToad will follow my scent!
 He's really just a child after all, contrary to appearances…
 Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!
 I’ll take one order of octopus dumplings, sir!
 Right!
 – Potatoes with butter please! – You got it!
 – I want chocolate bananas. – Right!
 – I want apricot candy! – Thank you!
 – I want okonomiyaki too! – Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!
 One extra-large order of fried noodle, sir!
 Right…But my you've got a lot of food there, young man!
 You don't plan to eat it all yourself now, do you?!
 Eh? As a matter of fact, I am gong to eat it all myself.
 Oh, um, here you go…
 I think I ate a bit too much.
 I wonder how everyone is?
 Kakashi Sensei… Sasuke… Sakura…
 I'm going to train hard every day and come back stronger.
 Just you wait and see!
 But before that… I better work off that meal!
 Last one!
 – All right! Perfect! – Oh! Amazing!
 That's the fruit of hard training throwing shuriken.
 You stink, sonny!
 Hah! Gosh darn it! Well, just watch this!
 Hold it!
 Huh?
 Attention: Shinobi! Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!
 Thanks now!
 You shouldn't try to walk around with the mask on.
 It's Pervy Sage’s bank saving book.
 One, ten, one hundred…
 L-Look at all those zeros!
 He should be treating me now and then if he has this much money.
 Stingy old geezer!
 There's only a little left… . One more stand and that will be it…
 Time to make you strong… Training!
 Two grilled squids please, sir! Make one of those an adult size!
 Okay! Someone sent you to buy some squid, eh?!
 I'll throw in a child size for free! Coming right up!
 Hurray for you, sir! You're a man among men!
 Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right! I'll give you the adult one for half price!
 Thanks!
 Good grief, where did he go to?!
 Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?
 Young ladies are so nice.
 Oh, Naruto! You've already had you're fill of the festival?
 Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!
 You're breaking all three at once! You bastard!
 W-Wait, Naruto…
 N-No, I won't wait!
 You used all my hard-saved money!
 – Take this and this and this! – N-Naruto, stop!
 I'll pay it all back! I'm sorry, p-please!
 You! You! You made my froggy wallet all flat!
 Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!
 You stained Leader's designer suit! You'll have to pay for it!
 Fork over 100,000 ryo!
 What?! You're telling me that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!
 Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
 to say a dorky suit like that cost 100,000 ryo.
 Are you asking for it?!
 You better put a lid on it if you know what's good for you.
 The leader used be a Chunin from the Hidden Village of Stones,
 the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!
 Come again? Legendary what?
 You seem to want to get hurt!
 Naruto.
 Perfect timing.
 I'll show you a Jutsu now… Watch very carefully!
 Now you've done it!
 A-Amazing!
 I was holding back quite a bit… You guys are so weak.
 A-Are you? The…legendary…
 I'm sorry… We kind of destroyed your stand…
 H-Here… Fix it with this.
 Oh! Thanks.
 Would you mind if I bought all your balloons and water balloons
 at the same time, my man?
 Fine by me…
 That wasn’t an ordinary hand move…
 What in blazes was that?! That Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 Come with me! It’s training time!
 Yes, sir!
 Finally, the mood is right for a little training.
 – Here! Water balloon! – Wha--?
 Eh?! What is it for?!
 You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?
 Y-Yeah.
 What Jutsu did it look like to you?
 It looked like you made your opponent spin violently.
 His perspective's off… But I guess that's to be expected.
 Right, okay… Yes, spinning!
 He's spinning the water in the balloon without moving his hand?!
 Whoa!
 The tree-climbing exercise
 to learn to gather and maintain Chakra in necessary places…
 The Walk-on-Water exercise
 to learn how to release a set amount of Chakra…
 You did both of these, right?
 And now with this water balloon exercise,
 you'll learn how to create a stream of Chakra…
 In other words, spinning.
 Create a stream of Chakra…
 I'll give a more detailed explanation of the Jutsu
 once you get these first steps down.
 First, you must gather and maintain Chakra in your hand
 using the tree-climbing technique.
 Then you must continuously release Chakra
 using the Walk-on-Water technique.
 Then you push and churn the water in the balloon with the Chakra!
 I get it!
 Then you spin the water in the balloon faster and faster
 until the balloon pops!
 You're catching on more and more quickly!
 Okay, today we're going to train until evening!
 Yes, sir!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 I will break this water balloon no matter what!
 Hey, you're full of spirit!
 Perhaps I can expect him to master the Jutsu.
 The water inside the balloon is moving.
 By the way, when does that pop?
 Next time: “Keep on Training: Pop Goes the Water Balloon!”
 Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!

46,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 The Powerful Helper
 Old Man Genno…
 Yes! This is quite good!
 Isn't it?!
 Why’d he do something like this?
 Now this detonator won’t activate.
 Excellent, Tenten.
 Now we can sigh with relief.
 No, it’s still too soon to be relieved.
 Right… When Genno realizes that
 the detonator here has been removed…
 he might activate the Paper Bombs with
 some other method and blow up the Leaf.
 Oh, right.
 You jerk. Don’t scare me like that, Choji!
 Sorry.
 At the moment, it seems there’s no one here
 who’s picked up on our movements.
 All right, then put things back the way they were.
 Got it.
 Now then…
 You guys do the Kunai Knife practice like before.
 Don’t hit the center.
 We know.
 But we were sure lucky… Nobody hit the center.
 But I hit it right in the center yesterday.
 I bet you were off by a little.
 What? I don’t know about that..
 It hit, I tell you.
 To think there’d be this many.
 Lady Tsunade, let’s evacuate the villagers as quickly as possible.
 Hey, you’re joking, right?
 What do you mean?
 If you do that, Genno might…
 blow up the remaining Paper Bombs
 right under the cover of the evacuation confusion.
 I see.
 Naruto and the others are removing the Paper Bombs now.
 Could you wait for their report?
 Akamaru?
 Did you find one?
 There it is!
 All right!
 Attaboy, Akamaru.
 How’s it coming?
 Just a little more.
 Yes!
 I leave the rest to you.
 Leave it to me.
 Did you get it yet, Naruto?
 Just a little more.
 Just a little more, I tell you.
 H-Hang in there, Naruto.
 Damn it, you little…
 Hey, what’re you guys doing?
 Oh, umm…
 Some money got into the opening.
 Oh, I’ll get it out for you later.
 No, no. That’d be dangerous…
 I mean, there’s no time to waste with eating ramen.
 Th-That’s right.
 Ichiraku is sure tasty, isn’t it? Well, hang in there.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Thanks.
 Phew, we got through it well.
 Excellent, Naruto.
 We’d like more manpower.
 It takes too long just with us.
 But there aren’t any other Shinobi left in the village.
 Well, there are some here, though.
 People of leisure who do nothing but tell about old stories and
 complain about what the young people do.
 Huh?
 Could they be…?
 Did you get that foul mouth from the Third Hokage?
 It’s the job of us advisors to give advice to the youngsters.
 What’s wrong with complaining?
 It seems you have a good nose for village crises due to your longevity.
 You’re plenty older than you look yourself.
 Wh-What did you say? You old bag!
 Watch what you say, eh, Fifth Hokage.
 We’ve grasped most of the situation. Where should we head to?
 Then there’s a place I’ve been saving for you.
 Oh ho. I can’t wait.
 To think the Fifth Hokage would be beaten.
 That’s a powerful supporter.
 Wow.
 But scary.
 Hurry! Youth, full power!
 The enemy’s in the Leaf!
 I appreciate it, but I can’t stand those two.
 But the removal operation will proceed swiftly
 once Guy Senpai and the others who headed for the Hidden Waterfall get back.
 It’ll be nice if things were to go conveniently like that, but…
 Shikamaru, have you got something?
 I mean, it’s not ordinary stuff.
 When and how the hell did he set them?
 There are too many Paper Bombs. An abnormal amount of it.
 No doubt about it.
 Uh-huh.
 And there’s one more thing bugging me.
 We’re overlooking something huge… I really get that feeling.
 Almost.
 What’re you doing? You’re not supposed to hit the center.
 That’s right.
 I’m next. I’ll miss.
 In your case, you’ll probably miss even if you aim.
 How’s it going, Neji?
 The Paper Bomb removal operation is going smoothly.
 I don’t see anyone resembling Genno either.
 I wonder where the enemy is.
 Making us walk all the way to the outskirts of town.
 She must’ve gotten this slave driver tendency from the Third Hokage.
 A place that wouldn’t be unusual for old people to tell old stories.
 I’ll rake her over the coals when we get back.
 But what is that Genno fellow thinking?
 There’s no point to setting Paper Bombs in a place like this.
 Is that what you really think?
 What?
 There was a plan to build
 a shopping district around here before, right?
 That talk was over thirty years ago.
 Hmm?!
 What’s this?
 H-Hey, isn’t that…?
 Yes.
 Look at this.
 What is it?
 The Jutsu form written here is different.
 You’re right.
 Now that you mention it, there’s no doubt.
 It looks the same to me, though.
 Where are your eyes pointing?
 It’s the first time I’ve seen this.
 It’s nothing new to us.
 Speaking of Paper Bombs, that’s what they were in the old days.
 Then this is an old version?
 It seems most of the Paper Bombs
 that have been set in the village are of that type.
 Everyone, please look closely once more
 at the locations where the Paper Bombs were set.
 Although this is a residential area here,
 there are hardly any Paper Bombs set.
 On the other hand, a large number of Paper Bombs
 have been set in places where hardly anyone lives.
 What does that mean?
 In the old plans,
 that was supposed to become a bustling shopping district.
 What? Could that be…?
 If you think about it putting together various factors
 such as the antique Paper Bombs,
 the places where they were set and such…
 This is a trap that was set thirty years ago.
 Thirty years ago…
 It’s just ridiculous. Not one person noticed in thirty years.
 It’s a blind spot.
 Nobody would ever think
 that this many Paper Bombs would be set here in this village.
 Once buried in a wall,
 it couldn’t be found unless Byakugan or something was used.
 Then you mean the Genno guy tried to use
 the Paper Bombs someone set thirty years ago?
 But how did he find them?
 Thirty years ago? Could it be…?!
 Shikamaru, where are you going?
 Hey! Wait up.
 We’re finished here, too
 Let’s go to the next spot, Hinata.
 Right.
 Hinata!
 What’s the matter?
 I was using the Byakugan the whole time,
 so I’m just a little tired… I’m fine.
 Are you sure?
 Let me see.
 Oh.
 You’re kind of feverish. Your face is red, too.
 No, it’s not like that.
 I’ll be okay if I just rest a little…
 Really? Then I’ll deliver the Paper Bombs
 we’ve gathered thus far to Grandma Tsunade,
 so you wait here.
 Okay.
 I’ll be right back!
 Ichiraku Ramen
 The old man was standing here the first time I met him.
 I thought he was just a ramen-loving old man, but…
 Hm?
 Could it be that what he was looking at then was…?
 Why in a place like this?
 Well well…
 So you found it, huh?
 Old man?
 I guess I cannot let you go back now, can I?
 Thirty years ago, huh?
 That’s around the time when my dad was still the master carpenter.
 It was probably a time
 when many outsiders were hired just like now.
 But I wonder if there are records from back then.
 Anything would be fine. A blueprint or a ledger.
 Hey, Shikamaru. What’re you talking about? Explain.
 Why did the referral vanish?
 Referral? You mean the real referral
 that became the catalyst for Genno being suspected?
 It was bugging me the whole time.
 Perhaps the disappearance of the referral was Genno’s doing.
 But why was it necessary to get rid of it?
 It all makes sense if we consider the referral
 that disappeared was a fake, too.
 What do you mean?
 But that referral was always here.
 So it was Genno himself
 who came here to work with that referral thirty years ago.
 Oh!
 That is to say…probably.
 At that time, he used a referral
 that couldn’t be distinguished from the real thing.
 And then he went to the trouble of making one
 that would be recognized as a fake if compared with that one.
 Why?
 Even with old referrals,
 he would be discovered if reinvestigated again.
 So he got rid of it right after you blew the whistle on him.
 In order to conceal the fact that he worked here thirty years ago.
 It’s because at that time in the village,
 he set as many Paper Bombs as were available.
 Why?
 Why’d you do such a thing?!
 Long ago, there was a village
 called Heat Devil Village in the Land of Mountains.
 This is the village where I was born.
 Heat Devil Village?
 You don’t know it?
 No…
 The only thing recorded in the Bingo Book you brought
 is that Genno’s homeland is the Land of Mountains.
 To be precise, Heat Devil Village in the Land of Mountains.
 The village itself vanished,
 so it probably ended up not being recorded.
 Thirty years ago,
 the Village Hidden in Leaves and Heat Devil Village were at war.
 Neither side didn’t give an inch and the battle was in deadlock.
 We launched a successful sneak attack on Heat Devil Village,
 taking advantage of the absence of their main forces.
 The tide of the war turned to the Leaf’s advantage in one shot.
 The only thing written in the history books
 is that an armistice was concluded three months after that.
 These three months are what’s peculiar.
 Heat Devil Village should’ve been thinking about a counterattack
 before accepting a cease fire.
 Here it is. lt’s my dad’s diary from thirty years ago.
 Really?
 Yeah. It seems he left it faithfully.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 ""A middle-aged man from the Hidden Sand came
 ""with a master carpentry referral.""
 ""His skills aren’t great, but I decided to hire him as I want manpower.""
 The date is one week after the Heat Devil Village attack.
 Then like you thought…
 Checkmate. This is Genno.
 It was my mission to infiltrate the Leaf
 and to set Paper Bombs throughout the village.
 The operation was for the main forces of Heat Devil Village
 to invade the Village Hidden in the Leaves at the same time
 as the Paper Bomb explosions and inflict a devastating blow.
 I went out to various sites and set Paper Bombs.
 The Leaf village did not have substantial Anbu Black Ops as they do now.
 So I was able to move about with ease.
 Right around the time when two and a half months had passed,
 I finished setting almost all of the Paper Bombs…
 and all that was left was to wait for my comrades to attack.
 But my comrades never came.
 Why?
 The leader of Heat Devil Village who had insisted on “do-or-die” resistance;
 lost his life in an accident.
 And the man who assumed the position of leader in his place
 agreed to a ceasefire with the Leaf.
 What?
 ""Genno doesn’t show up at the scene. I wonder what the deal is.""
 He disappeared having left behind the Paper Bombs.
 As for me, my intention was to immediately return to the Hidden Leaf.
 I thought the ceasefire would just be a temporary thing anyway.
 But Heat Devil Village would never give me another mission.
 Two weeks after the ceasefire,
 the Village Hidden in the Vale launched a sneak attack on Heat Devil Village
 and it was destroyed.
 No way!
 They were targeted at a moment
 when they were weariest from the battle with the Leaf.
 Their defenses were probably also down due to the ceasefire.
 ""Two months has passed since…
 Where did Genno disappear off to…?""
 Then why come back to the Leaf Village now after all this time?
 You set Paper Bombs because it was your mission, right?
 If Heat Devil Village is no more,
 then there should be no reason to go to the trouble of smashing the Leaf!
 Could it be…someone asked you to smash the Leaf?
 Rest easy.
 I haven’t been commissioned or commanded by anyone.
 Then why?
 How can I put this? It felt like a waste.
 A waste? What’s up with that?
 I’m getting old and I could be taken to heaven any time now.
 If I were to die as is,
 I’d be buried in darkness without anyone learning of my traps.
 If so, then I thought I’d put them to good use before I die.
 Are you serious?
 You tried to kill people in the village just for that reason?
 I can’t believe that!
 Then treating me to ramen was to…
 It was to find out
 about the present state of affairs in the Leaf.
 Damn you! You jerk!
 You’ll understand when you get older!
 I don’t understand! As for me…
 I won’t ever understand it!
 I’ll show you my final big job as a Trapper!
 No way will I let you do that!
 My friends are now in the middle of removing all the Paper Bombs!
 I won’t let the bombs blow up!
 Sounds like quite a struggle.
 But who said I was going to blow up the Paper Bombs?
 What’re you talking about? You just said that before you die…
 I said I would put them to good use. You’re naïve, boy.
 What?
 I can put them to sufficiently good use even without blowing them up.
 Katsu!
 A Shinobi reads two or three moves ahead
 and prepares several moves in advance.
 Remember that!
 Shikamaru!
 What is it?
 The Academy students are saying they’re tired.
 What should we do?
 The Academy students?
 The Kunai Knife practice, right?
 What? They were still doing that?
 You idiot! You were the one who had them do it.
 Oh, oh yeah. Then have them go ahead wrap things up.
 Rather, it’d be trouble if they were to get lucky and hit the center.
 Oh!
 What is it?
 I get it. So that’s it!
 It’s unnatural for a guy so prepared
 to casually entrust the final explosive device to pure luck.
 What do you mean?
 A Shinobi of Genno’s level should blow it up with the most effective timing.
 In other words,
 it doesn’t matter whether the Paper Bombs explode or not.
 It’s just a diversion.
 He’s really after something else!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Choji, things might get pretty ugly.
 You’ve figured something out, huh?
 We need to contact the Fifth Hokage.
 To not let the returning forces enter the village.
 Got it! But… Why?
 If the Paper Bombs were all a diversion,
 then the moment he makes his move
 is most likely when the main forces return!
 What?!
 Shikamaru! Choji! We’ve got trouble!
 What happened, Hinata?!
 Naruto… Naruto’s in trouble!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Where is... this place...?
 Who is it?
 Me... 					from long ago?
 Father and mother didn’t need to die!
 Everyone was killed.
 I had no power so...
 the clan vanished.
 Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Ino... Why?
 I can’t let you upstage me in front of Sasuke!
 Squirming again...
 The Leaf Village worms wandered in.
 What are the two of you thinking?!
 They’re bad news!
 It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped!
 Ino steps out and we men should run?
 Sorry to get you involved.
 But anyway we’re a Three-Man Squad, after all.
 We’re all in this together, aren’t we?
 Well, we’ll see.
 No! I don’t want to die yet!
 Let go of my scarf!
 You’re annoying! Quit wiggling!
 It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso.
 What did that guy just say?
 I....didn’t quite catch it.
 Huh?!
 That word is taboo to Choji.
 Try saying it again...
 I said if you have a problem, pull out, fatso.
 Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso
 I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned! Blast it!
 Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!
 W-Wow...
 All right! You understand this, right?!
 This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!
 Lucky! He’s lost it!
 No way, this looks like it’s going to be a pain in the butt.
 That’s my line.
 I was told to get Sasuke by the end of the test...
 Sasuke...
 Sakura...
 The two behind... take care of them.
 Okay!
 Well then, Team Ino, let’s go full throttle!
 Right!
 Formation Ino!
 – Shika! 					– Cho!
 I’m counting on you, Choji
 Okay!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!
 Human Boulder!
 What is this Jutsu?
 Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You!
 He jumped?!
 The air pressure of Slicing Sound Wave
 is less than effective against that rotation.
 Even if I do the Super Sound Wave, if I’m touched by something like that
 the bones in my arms will be crushed!
 Think I’ll let you?!
 You’re the most annoying so...
 Ninja Art!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 My body!
 Huh?!
 Dosu?!
 What are you doing at a time like this?!
 Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
 Ino, next it’s just the ladies.
 Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.
 Gotcha!
 Huh?
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Shoot!
 Kin!
 What happened?
 This... is the end of it.
 You guys!
 If you make one move,  this girl named Kin is dead meat!
 If you don’t want this to end right here,
 leave your scroll and walk away!
 Once you’ve gone far enough that I can’t feel your Chakras,
 I’ll release this girl!
 These guys... What are they grinning about?
 – Choji! 					– Yeah!
 This isn’t good! They won’t...!
 Ino!
 Uggghh. I’m dizzy.
 W-What kind of person... hurts their own comrades?
 Careless.
 Our goal is not the scrolls or to pass this test playing by the rules.
 What?
 It’s Sasuke.
 Humph...
 My Jutsu...
 So your much precious Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
 is limited to 5 minutes?
 It’s not Shadow Paralysis. lt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 In addition, it seems that this girl’s Jutsu...
 seems to be a Jutsu to take over the other’s body.
 From the looks of the blood she’s spitting up,
 if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
 Are you going to do in... your teammate?
 If I need to...
 This is no good.
 Shoot...
 That’s too bad... you’re just a step away.
 You’re too easy-going.
 Hmph, I don’t like this at all.
 You minor Sound Ninjas...
 Bullying the second-rate guys and putting on airs like a winner.
 What?!
 They're Lee’s teammates...
 Lee!
 You goofed.
 Hah! Coming out of nowhere like cockroaches...
 That kid with the bob lying over there is on our team, but...
 But you messed with him, didn’t you?!.
 What’s with his eyes?
 It’s like they see through everything...
 If you’re gonna continue,  I’ll fight with full strength!
 Huh?
 What ‘s wrong? Neji...
 This Chakra...
 If you don’t like me, don’t play cool, come down here.
 No. Evidently, there’s no need for that.
 After all...
 without power...
 I can’t do anything!
 Because I had no power... Everyone was killed!
 No... You let them be killed.
 You only... watched.
 If only I had power...
 If only I had power...
 Sasuke! You’re awake... Huh?!
 Huh?
 That’s...
 Sasuke?
 Sakura...
 Sakura...
 Who did this to you?
 Who is it?
 The Curse Marks run around his entire body?!
 Sasuke... 					That body...?
 Don’t worry.
 On the contrary, strength is rapidly flowing in...
 Right now I feel good.
 That guy gave this to me.
 Huh?
 At last I understand...
 I’m an Avenger...
 On my road, I must put power into my hands...
 even if it means abandoning myself to the devil.
 So... I see...
 So the mark on the neck that this girl called Sakura spoke of
 is this Curse Mark.
 But...
 I didn’t think he could stand up...
 Sakura, tell me...
 Who harmed you...?
 Me!
 Huh?
 Ino!
 If you stay like that you’re gonna get involved!
 Come back to this body!
 Choji, you too, come over here and hide.
 Y-Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 Release!
 Okay, she’s back!
 Shikamaru!
 What’s going to happen now?
 How should I know?
 Wha--?!
 W-What’s this...?
 No matter...
 how you look at it....
 his Chakras are...
 too big!
 Dosu, this half-dead bastard is nothing to be scared of!
 Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?!
 I’ll take care of all of them...
 in one fell swoop!
 Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
 Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
 – Who did? 					– Huh?!
 Zaku!
 He’s fast!
 Moreover, he took in those two, and in the blink of an eye.
 Fire Style!
 Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Don’t push your luck!
 I’ll blow them off!
 What?!
 Shuriken’s in the fire?!
 Zaku, below you!
 The quality of the Chakra  is completely different...
 Is that really Sasuke?
 What happened? What in the world...?
 It seems like you’re proud of your arms...
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 Sasuke will definitely come for me.
 You’re the only one left.
 You...
 make it a little more fun for me.
 This isn’t...
 This isn’t...
 This is not like...
 Sasuke!
 S-Stop!!
 Stop it.
 Please...
 Stop.
 The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
 We’re saved for now.
 Sasuke!
 You’re strong.
 Sasuke... We can’t defeat you the way you are now.
 This is our fee for settling this...
 Please let us withdraw from here.
 Huh?
 It seems selfish, but we now have something we need to confirm, too.
 That being said, let’s make a promise.
 If there’s another opportunity to battle with you in this test,
 we won’t run or hide.
 Wait!
 Who in the world is Orochimaru?
 What did he do to Sasuke?!
 Why Sasuke?!
 I don’t know...
 We were just given orders to make the hit on Sasuke.
 Though you ordered us to assassinate Sasuke,
 you got to him first.
 Moreover, you didn’t kill him, and left that Curse Mark instead.
 I don’t know what you’re thinking...
 Hey! Are you okay?!
 It’s a pain, but Ino, I’ll leave Lee to you.
 Got it.
 That Chakra... lt’s abnormal.
 The Uchiha clan... this good, huh?
 Sakura’s in danger!
 It’s okay... I’ll protect Sakura.
 Well, what should we do with this guy?
 Kick him awake?
 Can I do it?
 What am I...?
 Sasuke...
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what’s up Akamaru?
 Wait a minute, Naruto, he’s acting strange.
 What, are you hungry?
 Doesn't seem like it. How about a walk?
 I know. You’re looking for an electric pole, aren’t you?
 He bit me!

48,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Like I said, I've already told you everything I know.
 You first met Genno at Ichiraku…
 What did you talk about then?
 I don’t remember everything!
 That’s what we want to know.
 If we analyze your conversation,
 we might be able to figure out who hired Genno.
 We already know all the conversations
 that you've had during the past two weeks.
 What we want to know is what you guys talked about before that.
 You tell me that but… I don’t remember…
 Then we’ll put you under Regressive Hypnosis.
 Huh? Regressive Hypnosis?
 Using hypnosis,
 we can bring out the memory of the past from your subconscious…
 Oh…
 Just relax…
 Back to the Past Jutsu!
 Let’s start…
 Right now you are traveling through your memories…
 A day ago… two days ago… three days ago…
 Keep going back into the past.
 And…it’s the day you met the old carpenter.
 Where are you?
 Inside…the forest…
 The Anbu Gives Up?                                  Naruto's Recollection 		I was training on my own… 		And it was lunch time so…
 I headed for Ichiraku…
 And that’s where…
 You met him not inside the restaurant, but outside, yes?
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Huh? Oh yes…
 I was just trying to figure out if I should go into the restaurant or not.
 Is it any good?
 Old man, you’re not from here are you?
 Oh… I’m a freelance carpenter. How did you know?
 Because all the Leaf Village people know that Ichiraku’s ramen is the best!
 I see…
 Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
 Yes! This is quite good!
 Isn’t it?!
 Thank you for this meal!
 You’re already done?
 I am a growing boy!
 Even an extra large isn’t enough for me!
 I see… Then, why don’t I give you some of mine.
 What? Are you sure?
 Yes.
 Lucky!
 Thanks…old man!
 So…we said good-bye after we finished eating the ramen…
 And when did you meet him next?
 I met him in front of Ichiraku again…
 Byakugan!
 There’s nothing here either…
 I see…
 Byakugan!
 I see…
 It seems like there were odor neutralizing components
 in last night’s smoke screen.
 He was quite prepared
 Then why did he get caught?
 Well, that’s because our Anbu Black Ops are really good, right…?
 He should have known
 that our Anbu Black Ops were excellent before he infiltrated us…
 He should have had other escape routes ready.
 Now that you mention it, that sounds about right…
 But right now, there’s no way to find out.
 Dead men tell no tales, I see.
 Over here.
 What are you doing?
 We’re connecting the pieces of the corpse.
 Connecting the pieces…
 It was in a really awful shape.
 From what I hear, he had Paper Bombs all over his body…
 Would you like to wait outside until we’re done?
 I-I suppose so…
 I’ll stay here!
 What?
 You’re quite impressive…
 Sakura.
 And he gave me eggs and barbeque pork that time…
 He’s talking about Ramen again.
 Shh!
 Oh, I remember that time…!
 What happened?
 He showed…me a photograph.
 A photograph?
 A photograph of a guy that looked about my age.
 When I asked him why he was so nice to me…
 I have a grandson.
 He’s about the same age as you.
 So I can’t think of you as a stranger.
 I look forward to treasure hunting with my grandson on my days off.
 Treasure hunting?
 Yeah…
 What, you’re already done eating?!
 Then I’ll give you some of mine.
 Thanks, old man!
 What happened to your hand?
 Oh… It’s a scar from a long time ago
 when I accidentally cut myself with a saw.
 Oh.
 And then he gave me his ramen again…
 Genno has no relatives…
 Then his story about his grandson a lie?
 We started marking him the next day.
 I think any more inquiries are pointless.
 I guess he wouldn’t be careless enough
 to leak any information even to a Gennin.
 An emergency report from Lady Tsunade!
 I see… There was nothing unusual about any of the buildings.
 They were all built according to their plans…
 There were no signs of any traps.
 So was it just camouflage for him to sneak in as a carpenter?
 It’s too soon to make a judgment on that.
 If he was just supposed to steal the plans,
 there was no need for him to be a carpenter.
 By the way, what were you guys looking up?
 We got a list of places where he used to stop by
 from his carpenter buddies,
 and we’re looking through all those places,
 but so far we haven’t found any clues.
 Oh, there’re a lot of restaurants…
 Yeah… Seems like he never went out besides to go eat.
 In the meantime, Hinata, you go see Ino and Sakura
 at the forensics center.
 Neji and Choji, you guys go help Kiba and Shino!
 Understood.
 Then, we should get going too…
 Shikamaru!
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you!
 The Fifth Hokage is?
 What?! The Village Hidden in the Waterfalls?
 It seems that they’ve committed all their troops into battle position.
 They’re calling it a big practice run, however…
 Big practice run…?
 I don’t think I need to say more, but…
 It’s been used many times in the past. They get all of their troops together
 for the purpose of a big practice run and then invade another country…
 Furthermore, there is information that Genno stayed in
 the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 before coming to the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 It wouldn’t be unusual if there was some sort of connection.
 Most of the Ninja we've deployed
 have already been mobilized to the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 Crossing the border will be taken as a sign of willful invasion.
 We will attack anyone that enters.
 Shikamaru, I want you to head over to the border, too!
 I don’t think that there’s a need for us to go.
 Shikamaru?!
 What do you mean…?
 Naruto. 					Hey, Naruto!
 Huh?
 You’re getting in the way of my business by standing there!
 Oh… Sorry.
 Now that I think about it,
 I’ve never seen the old man finish his ramen…
 Could it be that he hated ramen?
 But then why did he come to lchiraku all the time?
 Tell us why.
 Ten Gennin and one Chunin…
 Our presence or absence won’t make much of a difference
 to the overall situation.
 What is your point…?
 I don’t like it…
 Old Man Genno’s actions…
 After the investigation, I’ve figured it out…
 His everyday activities were quite impressive…
 His abilities as a carpenter was average,
 he was quite plain, never stood out, and never made any big mistakes
 Nobody hated him, and nobody liked him.
 Even if he were to disappear all of a sudden,
 no one would think twice about it the next day…
 A very low-key profile.
 It’s an undercover technique that's so impressive
 that I’d want to put it in a Shinobi textbooks.
 A brilliant Shinobi like him being marked by the Anbu Black Ops so easily…
 Don't you think that's a bit strange…?
 That’s true…
 And when he was trying to get away…
 He was able to get away from the Anbu Black Ops,
 but they caught up to him.
 For a trap professional, it seems like such a lame end.
 On top of all that, the plans have completely disappeared.
 It doesn’t make any sense to me.
 And…?
 Everything is moving along according to his plan.
 It couldn’t be…?
 His true identity being discovered,
 and dying in front of the Anbu Black Ops…
 What if all of that was his plan?
 And if he had predicted that we would all leave the village
 in taking precautions against the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls…
 We could be just dancing on the palm of his hand.
 But if we look at all the information we have at this point,
 we need to be on alert for the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls.
 That’s true, but…
 However…
 I don’t think the situation will change much
 just by sending another ten Gennin and one Chunin…
 I’ll have the Shikamaru squad continue to investigate Genno.
 Understood.
 Shikamaru! Choji!
 Sorry… I didn’t mean to make you wait.
 My head hurts…
 Hey. Why do we have to look through these books?
 I don’t want to do it either. But this is the basis of investigation.
 But still… There’re so many numbers, my eyes are hurting.
 I’m sorry… I still can’t find it .
 I see…
 What?
 The old recommendation letter that enabled them
 to figure out that Genno’s recommendation letter was a fake.
 Why do you have to look for that?
 Just a hunch…
 Did the people of this house just lose it? Or did he…
 In either case,
 he should have wanted to get rid of
 the recommendation letter that he brought…
 Why would he just get rid of the old recommendation letter?
 This is where he took his own life…?
 It seems that they’ve already collected the remains.
 It’s a job done by the Anbu Black Ops…
 They don’t leave anything behind.
 Everyone, come over here!
 Look, the tree is burned on both sides!
 The Paper Bombs exploded…
 There should be burned marks.
 The fact that it’s on both sides is the problem!
 I see. If it were just a suicide bomb,
 it wouldn’t have left marks on both sides.
 There would have to be at least two explosions
 to leave this kind of burn marks.
 But according to the Anbu Black Ops,
 he exploded the Paper Bombs that were wrapped around his body.
 But no one saw him at the moment of the explosion…
 There may be Anbu Black Ops,
 but they’d still need to dodge the explosion.
 This one’s burned on both sides too…
 Same on this tree too.
 Probably…
 First, the Paper Bombs that were placed on
 the trees in the surrounding area were blown up…
 Then there was a huge explosion in the center.
 If he had set off the explosions close to each other,
 then it’s possible to perceive it as one explosion!
 I see…
 But in order to do that,
 he would have needed to set up some sort of trick before hand.
 Didn't Genno take his life
 after being cornered by the Anbu Black Ops?
 What if they didn't catch up to him,
 but rather, he let them catch up to him?
 So you’re saying that he was running away
 planning to let them catch up to him here?!
 It’s not impossible…
 If that is the case…
 It’s possible that he could have laid other traps
 Could it be that…
 the fact he killed himself with the Paper Bombs is also…
 It’s done. They said you could come in.
 Y-Yeah.
 It’s impossible.
 Didn’t the Anbu Black Ops make sure with their own eyes…?
 Yeah.
 There's no point in telling me to check out the body.
 I’m not a Medical Ninja.
 What should I check and how should I do it…?
 Sakura…
 This man… He snuck in as a carpenter right?
 That’s right. Is there something that bothers you?
 His hand… It’s too clean.
 My family owns a flower shop, remember?
 I’ve been helping out since I was a kid…
 So if I look at a person’s hand, I can tell what kind of job they do…
 Carpenter’s hands are much more rough.
 And there’s no way that a trap professional’s hand would be so clean!
 Then…!
 May I?
 Byakugan!
 Just as I suspected…
 There’s no evidence that he's trained his Chakra Network.
 This man has never controlled a Chakra…
 What?
 The people from the medical group were talking over there.
 That they have some questions about this body…
 This person is not a Ninja!
 Reporting! The spearhead of the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls
 is about to reach the borders!
 They’re fast… What about our enforcement army?
 They are gathering currently,
 but they’re not in position for battle quite yet…
 What if they attack even before we’re in position for battle?
 In any case… Who would have thought
 that the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls would…
 Nothing will come of that right now.
 Once the enemy crosses that river,
 we will see that as their intent to wage war on us,
 and we will start to attack!
 Yes!
 Academy?
 There were no plans for the Academy…
 Excuse me! Could you help me?
 Did you call?
 We saw that the Academy had made some payments last month…
 Last month?
 Oh this. We did some reparation work for the Academy.
 We don't have the plans for that.
 No, that’s not possible…
 That’s strange… Where did I put it?
 What’s going on?
 Above…?
 What’s the matter, Naruto?
 What’s going on?
 They should show themselves soon…
 Reporting! The Village Hidden in the Waterfalls spearhead
 that was closing in on the borders has started to retreat!
 What?!
 It seems like it really was a practice run…
 Then where are the stolen plans?!
 Th-This is…
 This is Shikamaru’s…
 These are the plans?
 Yeah…
 It’s written in a complex code so that it’s not easily deciphered.
 But…
 Why are the plans that were stolen by Genno appearing here?
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Students these days, sure lack civility.
 They usually do things like eat potato chips, eat barbeque…
 – Read comics. – And eat box lunches.
 – Is eating all you talk about? – All that loafing?
 Well, I mean the self study hours are for…
 – You know? – No, I don’t know.
 They devote themselves to training even though their Sensei is not watching.
 – Isn’t it beautiful? – Really?
 I am moved! I will back up their training myself!
 Huh?!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 That form…?!
 So that’s the extent of the rumored “Absolute Defense”?
 How disappointing.
 I see… You were wearing sand, eh?
 Your opponent’s not just him!
 I’m here, too!
 Th-That attack just now…
 It would’ve been dangerous had I not been protected by sand.
 M-My body is still…
 I’ll just be a hindrance like this.
 Annoying sand…
 You’re first, Gaara.
 He yanked out his spinal column?!
 Vengeful Strike:                               The Bracken Dance
 Dance of the Clematis Flower.
 Vine!
 Flower!
 A bone of the strongest calcification…
 It will pierce you, sand defense and all…
 No time…huh?
 Ultimate Defense: Shukaku’s Shield!
 Kabuto…
 How much longer will Kimimaro hold out for?
 I think he should still be okay for a while…
 I did all I could with the treatment…
 But there’s not nearly enough information about his body.
 I think it’d be quite different  if we had something
 like the medical history and treatment data of his clan.
 What came out after looking into it
 was the bloody history of how the Kaguya Clan became just him…
 Fools who provoked the great land of the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle
 with just their clan and were annihilated.
 The Kaguya Clan was a foolish clan that liked battle.
 The battlefield was the only place where they could be at peace.
 But it was long ago when a simple-minded group
 that only enjoyed slaughter was acceptable…
 The times are different now.
 Doing something like fighting only with power
 against a governed organization like the Mist…
 can only be called an act of fools rushing towards death.
 And then you saved only he who was the youngest
 and the most exceptional among the Kaguya Clan…
 That kid possessed the power that would be feared even by the fighting clan.
 So it seems he was kept in prison the whole time.
 It would’ve been a waste to let him…die.
 Who wouldn’t want that rare Kekkei Genkai?
 He possesses a strong and firm bone structure
 and a defensive power to repel all kinds of physical attacks.
 And if turned to offense…
 the bones become a most powerful weapon.
 It’s because I’ve fought him once that I understand this.
 That sand shield is an absolute defense, no less.
 And that unusual form…
 It’ll be okay. There’s no way it’ll be broken!
 It’s hard…
 I gathered minerals with great hardness from the ground,
 applied pressure with Chakra and mixed them into the sand.
 You… that unusual Jutsu…
 It’s the Kekkei Genkai, right?
 The Kaguya Clan…
 The ability which now only I possess.
 The last one of the clan, eh?
 Then it’ll die out here today.
 Indeed, that might happen.
 Due to sickness, my body will not last so long…
 But, the clan will not die out.
 Besides I’m not alone.
 This is the “Earth” Curse Mark…
 With this…
 I can become a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
 Let’s get everything, Kimimaro.
 And let’s see the truth of this world together.
 Yes.
 You’re my “Vessel of Dreams.”
 I’m counting on you.
 They are presents from me. I hope you like them.
 Would you rather…die or obey?
 Obey…
 You will!
 Is this the best a team of four can do?
 I’ll ask just once more…
 Which would you rather choose?
 Very well…
 As of now, we’re the Sound Ninja Five.
 Not alone, you said…?
 That’s right…
 As an existence shouldering one part of Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…
 I will remain inside Lord Orochimaru’s soul…
 for all eternity.
 Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
 You’re a pitiful guy.
 I used my big moves too much. I don’t have much Chakra.
 This is the last of it.
 What an amount of Chakra…
 You are something…
 I’ll sink and confine you 200 meters into the ground.
 By the pressure of the sand stuck to your body,
 you’ll soon be unable to move, not even a finger…
 You did it…! This time for sure you did it.
 Dance…
 Bracken Dance!
 It is annoying…
 It feels like a long time
 when waiting eagerly for something you want.
 Kabuto…
 Stop talking like you’re humoring a child!
 I’m sorry…
 But you should know this the most, Lord Orochimaru.
 Nobody can beat Kimimaro,
 no matter what hindrance should appear.
 Thanks for saving me…
 Being able to do something like this; very impressive.
 All I did was ride the sand I’m always controlling.
 You just have to know how you use it.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru…
 At last… The destruction of  the Leaf will begin…
 Third Hokage… I’ll teach you a thing or two.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 What’s the matter, Kimimaro?
 No… It’s nothing.
 Even the Kazekage of the Hidden Sand Village
 is no match against us.
 Of course…
 Kimimaro, it’s thanks to you…
 Kimimaro!
 Kimimaro, so you can’t go on, huh?
 I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru.
 If I can’t be of use…
 then there’s no significance to my living.
 How is your condition, Kimimaro?
 The “Destruction of the Leaf” resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.
 But the Sound Ninja Four have gone to pick up a new vessel…
 Lord Orochimaru’s new  “Vessel of Dreams.”
 Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?
 You’re a pitiful guy…
 You’re wrong… Far from it!
 There’s no significance to living…
 But…you might be able to discover something interesting
 by continuing to live…
 Like how you discovered that flower…
 Like how I discovered you.
 This is the “Earth” Curse Mark!
 With this… I can become a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.
 Let’s get everything, Kimimaro…
 And let’s see the truth of this world together.
 I’m going to discover the truth of this world!
 With Lord Orochimaru!
 He was a persistent guy, but this is the end.
 He won’t ever come out again.
 R-Right…
 I can’t go on…
 We’re getting off…
 It’s not brainwashing!
 That person… Lord Orochimaru understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 He’s dead…
 Could it be? Has Kimimaro…?
 The likes of Kimimaro makes no difference now…
 Sasuke… I can hardly wait for him.
 He’ll come here even by himself…
 I would have been totally hammered.
 That’s not the case.
 My sensei said it often…
 Luck is also a part of strength.
 That backseat driver?
 He’s not a backseat driver!
 It’s because…
 I wasn’t good enough at that time!
 I’m grateful for you saving me.
 But please don’t talk like that about my sensei!
 You, too…?
 When you feel that
 the honor of someone you revere has been hurt,
 you yourself are hurt badly and become enraged.
 The more important the person you revere is to you,
 the greater the feeling…
 The clan won’t die out… I’m not alone.
 I will remain inside Lord Orochimaru’s soul for all eternity.
 That person, Lord Orochimaru, understands me!
 What do you guys know?!
 Fighting for the sake of someone important to you…
 He was also the same as Naruto Uzumaki…
 But…the person who is important to oneself
 might not always be “virtuous.”
 I wonder…
 There’s no way someone evil can be thought of as an important person.
 No. Even if you know they’re “evil”…
 People can’t defeat solitude…
 Sasuke!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 You gotta be kidding me!
 What do you mean “for achieving your goal”?!
 Orochimaru wants you only as a “vessel”!
 There’s no way  I can let you go to him!
 This is no joke!
 If you insist on going, I have to take you back by force!

 Don’t say that!
 I certainly don’t think that he has any great techniques,
 but that Shikamaru is always good at strategizing.
 That’s why I feel like we ended up in the preliminary round the other day.
 Hmm, yeah well…
 And after all, he jumped down into the arena himself.
 He seems uncharacteristically driven.
 Even he can be passionate once in a while!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Geez, I envy a cloud being so free…
 I guess I pretty much am completely without desire…
 Even the reason why I became a Ninja…
 was because I thought I would have a fun life, ya know…
 Get it together!
 C’mon Shikamaru!
 But…of course, it’s not that easy.
 What’s going on with that stupid face?! ls he underestimating me?
 Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 That’s right, with this attack, my armed attacks also were beaten down.
 I see…
 Shadow Possession Jutsu! I’ve seen that true identity!
 Evidently there’s a limit to the stretching and shortening,
 changing shape of the shadow…
 No matter how much you change the shape of the shadow,
 even when you stretch it,
 it can only span up to the size of your own shadow.
 That’s right isn’t it?
 You got it…
 Even if I assume that he's made up the distance,
 by stretching his shadow from the edge of the shadow of the arena wall…
 This is the limit to how far the shadow can stretch.
 This is the scope of his attack!
 15 meters, 32 centimeters!
 She took the distance with the folding fan.
 Temari is stronger at long distance battles than she is at close range…
 the outcome has already been decided.
 What? What is that sign…?
 That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit.
 Habit…?
 He enjoys passing time slowly. That guy’s like an old man.
 That’s why he likes Japanese checkers and chess
 and always makes me be his opponent.
 When he’s stuck on a move, he always does that.
 Why?
 He’s working out his strategy.
 And, I’ve never beaten him.
 A strategy… but this is an actual fight.
 It’s different from a game.
 But it's said that formation pieces that were used to build battle strategy
 eventually become game pieces.
 Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
 Wait a minute.
 When we grouped the Genin, I saw his scores.
 They were at about the same level of that Naruto’s.
 He said that moving his pencil during written exams at the academy is a pain,
 and during the tests, he always sleeps instead.
 A pain…?
 He was so good at strategy games, I felt something wasn’t right…
 so I had him take an IQ test under the pretense that it was a game.
 And… how did it turn out?... …
 He was more than brilliant.
 With an IQ of over 200, he’s a super genius!
 T-Two hundred?!
 He’s done thinking… lt starts now.
 Looks like you’ve got some fighting spirit now…
 It’s pointless to hide!
 I wonder if he’s really got a strategy…
 M-Maybe…
 With that he has no approach!
 Shikamaru! Go for it!
 It’s pointless, isn’t it?
 He’ll give up soon.
 He hates things that are a pain in the butt.
 You're wrong! At least, I hope so…
 But you may be right…
 How long are you going to run away! Cut it out!
 It’s no use.
 As long as I’m on the outside of this line,
 he absolutely can’t catch me…
 No, wait! Close call!
 You caught on well.
 So you were dragging your feet to wait for the sun to set…
 in order to make the surface of your own shadow larger
 by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
 As the sun goes down, the shadows lengthen.
 Isn't that so?
 That was close! Shikamaru…
 But why is he using shadows?
 After all, Shikamaru is inside the shadow of the field.
 If there’s even a little bit of light, he can make a shadow within a shadow!
 You don’t know a thing about Shikamaru!
 A shadow…in a shadow…?
 Even if I calculate the height of the sun now
 and the limit to the distance of the previous attack,
 there's no mistaking the distance!
 Temari! Up!
 I see.
 What’s this?!
 Darn it!
 I won’t let you escape!
 I didn’t expect that he would create extra shadows to reach me
 by making a parachute with his jacket…!
 He’s impressive.
 Once I notice the parachute from above, I’ll take my attention off from my feet.
 That’s a sneaky trick to catch me off my guard!
 However, now it’s clear.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is
 one in which other shadows are used to get your opponent,
 a skillful technique!
 She’s dodged this trick too…
 Not careful enough in the final stage.
 And his opponent is fairly analytical.
 She’s good at thinking ahead.
 If this battle takes too long,
 the shadows in the arena will grow, and his territory will increase.
 I’ll defeat him with the next one!
 Should I make a diversion with Clone Jutsu…?
 Now his shadow is…
 Okay!
 Clone…
 N-No way…!
 My... body is…?!
 At last… Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 What?!
 What’s going on…?
 That boy…
 How much is he planning ahead…?
 That’s Shikamaru’s skill.
 Why…won’t my body move?!
 The shadow shouldn’t have reached this far.
 I'll let you take a look behind you…
 T-This hole…!
 You saw it too, didn’t you…?
 That hole is the hole Naruto burrowed and flew out of.
 So it’s connected to the big hole in front of you.
 I didn’t expect that… a shadow in a tunnel of a hole…
 Right.
 Pure and simple, a calculated chess move.
 So his purpose to make Temari measure the limit of the shadow several times
 was to lead her to his final trick of using this hole.
 Temari battled on the outside of the limit of the shadow
 that she measured and followed,
 but he caught her from behind, trailed by the shadow she couldn’t see…
 There is no escape from this.
 I-It can’t be…
 The attack that he used with the jacket,
 was it a device to lead me to right this spot…?
 Was that an underplot too?!
 Why that--?!
 Checkmate with the next one.
 My body is moving on its own! I can’t resist it!
 Before anyone knew it, they fell under the spell of this match.
 That guy with no mark is quite a darkhorse.
 Yes! You did it!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 Check…
 Good grief… I give up!
 What?!
 See I told you…he’d give up.
 Ino doesn’t know anything about Shikamaru.
 W-What did you say?!
 I’ve used too much Chakra from Shadow Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.
 I can’t hold it another 10 seconds.
 I thought of the next trick 200 times.
 But I’m out of time…
 This has become such a pain.
 Doing one match is good…
 That guy is a strange one.
 The winner is Temari!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Wow, this is the largest cheer from the audience ever!
 Of course. The featured battle of this final tournament is about to begin.
 Hate to admit it, but I'm looking forward to it myself.
 Hey, Shikamaru. I can't hear what you said.
 There's not a single person who's not excited about the featured battle.
 Next: ""Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand""
 I can't take my eyes away from this battle!

 The Third Hokage, Forever…
 Sarutobi…
 At the very least this sword…
 It was a fitting end for somebody like you
 who has mastered the Way of the Shinobi.
 It feels like my arms are burning…
 Master Orochimaru!
 This is where we call off our plan.
 Release the Barrier. We’ll head back.
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 The Barrier…!
 It’s released!
 Where is Lord Hokage?
 Let’s go!
 We won’t let you get away!
 Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!
 An adhesive type of string filled with Chakra…?
 Kakashi! They’re on the move! Do we go after them?
 No, wait, Guy.
 That’s right…
 If you make a move without any data on the situation up there,
 you will get caught in the enemy’s trap.
 I’m totally aware of that.
 But regardless of whether there is a trap or not,
 we can’t let the enemy get away at a time like this!
 That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
 So…are you just going to watch?
 Kabuto?
 So you did know, after all.
 So…what are we going to do?
 It’s about time that we made a retreat.
 You’re going to run away from me again?
 Right now…
 if we show our cards, they’re most likely going to be copied.
 Then again,
 it doesn't seem like you’ve completely mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
 Well then…
 Temari…
 Kankuro!
 I’m leaving Sakura with you.
 H-Hey!
 Why is…this guy so strong?
 My existence will not disappear…
 I will not disappear! I cannot disappear!
 I told you not to talk to that guy!
 Let’s go.
 Oh, there! That’s him…
 Go away!
 Monster! Monster! Monster…!
 You monster! Die!
 That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!
 Don’t look at him!
 Go away!
 To them, I’m just a relic of the past who they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 And that time, I thought of myself that I… no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 That I… that my existence didn’t matter to anyone else in the world.
 D-Don’t come any closer!
 The pain of…being all alone… really is unbearable, isn’t it?
 The way you feel…
 I don’t know why, but I completely understand that it hurts.
 But I’ve met people who are very important to me now.
 I won’t allow those important people… to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you even if that means…that I have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other people?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was.
 That’s why…they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 That’s enough, Naruto…
 Sakura is okay.
 This guy’s Chakra must have been depleted as well…
 Sakura’s sand crumbled a long time ago.
 Oh, I see…
 I’ve had enough… Stop here.
 Gaara?
 I’ve never seen Gaara in such a weakened state before…
 All right.
 Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
 LOVE 							One of these days, even I…
 Temari… Kankuro…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sorry…
 D-Don’t worry about it…
 Rain…
 The sky has started to weep as well…
 We will begin the memorial service
 for the Third Hokage, who lost his life in this battle,
 as well as the other victims of this battle.
 It’s started…
 In the end, all we could do was just watch…
 Why?
 Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
 Why…?
 It’s already been a year…
 It’s not easy to laugh hiding your sadness.
 I heard from your teacher that you’re the center of laughter…
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s a very honorable thing for a Shinobi to die doing their duty!
 My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
 to protect this village from the Demon Fox…
 They’re heroes!
 I am the child of the heroes! I’m not sad to be alone.
 And besides, these are tears of joy.
 It’s all right.
 I know that you’re curled up holding your knees by yourself.
 But you’re not alone…
 Huh?
 The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village have the will of fire…
 Will of fire…?
 It’s the strong will to protect the Leaf Village.
 As long as they have this will of fire, everybody in this village are all family.
 Iruka… I wonder if you have it?
 Yeah…
 For Hayate…?
 The Third Hokage’s funeral has already started. Make it quick.
 You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?
 If you’re always thinking of an excuse for your tardiness,
 you should just come earlier.
 I do…from early in the morning.
 It’s just that, whenever I come here
 I just want to punish myself for being such a fool in the past.
 Humph…
 Shinobi, no matter what kind of situation they are in,
 cannot show their emotion.
 You must always prioritize your mission,
 and never shed a tear in any kind of situation…
 Iruka Sensei…
 Hmm?
 Why do people risk their own lives for other people?
 When one person dies…
 their past, their present life, and their future disappear along with them.
 Many people die doing their duty and fighting in battle…
 And shockingly easily, too.
 Hayate was one of them.
 Those who pass away also have dreams and ambitions.
 But everyone has something else, just as important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers… Those who are dear to them.
 They trust each other and help each other,
 the people whom they’ve cherished since the day they were born.
 And that string which connects those people
 becomes stronger and thicker as time goes by…
 It can’t be explained by logic…
 Those who hold those strings just do it, because it’s important to them.
 Yeah, I kind of get it.
 But…
 It's tough to die.
 It’s not like he just died for nothing.
 He left us something very important.
 Well, you’ll eventually understand one of these days.
 Yeah, I kind of get that too!
 The rain’s stopped.
 Bye! Iruka Sensei!
 Yeah…
 Lord Third Hokage, the will of fire you spoke of
 seems to have been passed on to the young Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts which you lit
 will burn bright and strong…
 And it will shine upon this village, and watch over and protect us.
 It will become a new Hokage… one of these days…
 They did manage to avoid annihilation,
 but it seems the damage is pretty extensive.
 The village that was once at the height of its glory…
 How sad…
 How unlike you.
 You have lingering affections for your old home?
 Even you?
 No, not at all.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 The ritual ends, and morning mist will be covering all soon.
 Silence…
 In that white mist, the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
 It awakens childhood memory, disappointment, ire, and resolve.
 The cog wheel named destiny slowly begins to turn…

 A Limitless Supply of Ninja Tools
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 You’ve come back, Choji!
 Yay!
 Are you okay, Naruto!
 I’m okay, but I’m not okay with your heavy weight!
 I’ll get him right away!
 Stop it Choji! lt doesn’t work on him!
 What?
 This water absorbs all the shocks and it gives me an iron-wall defense.
 Oh, really?
 Shoot!
 Flower Ninja Art: Bloom! Myriad of Flowers!
 I’m saved.
 Where’d that guy go?!
 After a bonfire, you should put it out.
 There is a limit to your Kunai Knife,
 but my water that the earth gives me is infinite.
 His Ninjutsu is endless. So for now…
 Wanna run away?
 Say that you’ll withdraw!
 You can’t get away.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 After them!
 This way!
 If you get caught by that water, it’s over for sure!
 It’s coming around from this side too.
 It’s trying to trap us!
 Run! Run! You’re all going to get eaten if you get caught!
 At this rate, we’re eventually going to be defeated.
 Looks like we’ve gotta beat him up, after all.
 But how are we going to beat him
 if the attack doesn’t work on him?
 Damn!
 Huh?
 Don't you think there's something weird about him?
 Wh-What is?
 Hmm… I wonder?
 Don’t be joking at a time like this!
 Perhaps, is Naruto talking about his tonfa?
 Oh yeah, he’s holding his tonfa like a dowsing rod.
 That’s it!
 It’s called dousing.
 If you concentrate on the item you’re looking for,
 it will react to that item and inform you when you get near it.
 Dowsing?
 I see! Naruto, Choji!
 We might have a chance to win!
 Huh?
 If that tonfa is the secret of this Jutsu then…
 Naruto!
 Let’s rap up the chase!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Idiot.
 I’m not going to let you get away!
 I've got you!
 Seems like you tried to get close to me, but too bad
 Damn it!
 I’m going to prepare a special one for you.
 Wh-What Naruto?
 Hurry up and run, Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 Yurinojou! Choji!
 Choji!
 Behind you! Look behind you!
 I said look behind you!
 Choji!
 Choji!
 The fight is over.
 First, the big one, I’ll eat you first.
 Certainly the fight is over.
 A fight where you’re going to lose.
 What?!
 Right now Choji! Drink up the water!
 Useless, useless.
 Water will gush out from the ground with no limits.
 Why isn’t the water coming out?
 Like I said, it’s useless.
 What happened?!
 The water that will protect you will not come out of here.
 Look carefully at the surroundings..
 Yes, water does not come out of this craggy place.
 I’m full!
 Yurinojou has realized your secret.
 I also thought something was strange.
 When I went to check the trap,
 I decided to take the shortest route through the craggy area.
 It wouldn’t have been strange to run into you there…
 but that didn’t happen.
 The answer to that is easy!
 You made a detour because you avoided craggy areas
 where the water wouldn’t come out.
 The tonfa you hold is a weapon
 and was a way to find the water through dowsing.
 You lost them and you went away from your advantageous places.
 You mean… The reason why you cracked my tonfa was…
 Of course, it wasn’t a coincidence.
 It was planned by Yurinojou who calculated your actions.
 Damn it…!
 This one will be heavy because of the water!
 Human Boulder!
 You did it! Choji!
 Yurinojou!
 My ribs are injured, but… I’m okay.
 But there should be three of them, so hurry and get the princess!
 I got it!
 Choji, please take care of Yurinojou.
 Okay!
 I’ll catch up to Hinata!
 Let me rest a little.
 I got it.
 Let’s wait for everyone here.
 There’s no need to wait.
 After we rest a little, you are going to take me to a safe place.
 But Naruto and the others are not yet…
 That doesn’t matter!
 In the first place, everything became like this because of you guys.
 Instead of taking the long way,
 if we had used the merchant people as decoys,
 then we would have escaped by now!
 Decoys…? But Kikusuke has already…
 What about it?
 If your mission as Ninja is to risk your life in the line of duty,
 then Kikunojou should be satisfied.
 Even though Kikunojou is dead,
 if I am still alive, then it’s possible to revive the Land of the Green.
 Princess.
 Hinata, you won’t understand how I was separated from my parents
 to be held as hostage in a foreign country
 and how much I was bullied.
 I realized then that only fools would expect to live off of human compassion.
 Especially someone like Naruto
 who is easily influenced by people’s emotions
 should be disqualified as a Ninja.
 He loses his rationality in his goal.
 Princess, what do you know about Naruto?
 Naruto has lived without his parents since he was a child.
 He has always lived alone.
 To be accepted by everyone, to become the next Hokage…
 he has worked hard…really hard…
 Despite all that, he didn’t give up
 and he would never think of living at the expense of others.
 He tried and tried.
 Naruto and I are in different positions.
 I’m sorry. You’re right, Princess.
 Hinata… Do you like Naruto?
 I understand.
 Let’s wait for everyone here.
 Princess…
 That bag must be heavy.
 I will relieve you of some of the burden.
 Oh, thanks.
 I cannot die in a place like this.
 Don’t you look nice, Ruiga.
 Jiga… Help me… Brother…
 Whatever.
 If you die, Brother Renga and I could split the Land of Green’s profits.
 Jiga…
 Don’t blame me.
 W-Wait!
 S-Stop Jiga…!
 Hinata!
 Hinata.
 N-Naruto…
 Where is the Princess?
 That’s what I was going to ask!
 I said let’s wait here and the minute I turned around…
 Why does a Ninja like you get beaten by an amateur?
 S-Sorry.
 Then right now she should be alone…
 Naruto, we should first go back to the village
 and get advice from the Hokage.
 No! There’s no time for that.
 There are still two Janin left.
 She’ll get killed if she gets caught.
 But this really isn’t an official mission.
 We might not be able to handle the other two…
 You’re right…
 As you say, this may not be an official mission but…
 she’s trying really hard to escape by herself right now.
 The things she says and does may be wrong,
 but somehow, I can’t leave her alone.
 Naruto, I’ll also…
 Hinata!
 Yurinojou got hurt.
 You and Choji, please take care of Yurinojou!
 See you later!
 Oh!
 Be careful, Naruto…
 Right there!
 I see, you have good instincts.
 I’ll praise you for getting Ruiga.
 Are you the second Janin?
 Oh, I feel honored that you know about me.
 Then you should brag about it in the other world.
 That Mr. Jiga killed you, so it couldn’t be helped.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 What?
 That wouldn’t work.
 This guy…
 What kind of Ninjutsu is he using?
 A Hidden Leaf Ninja, huh? How interesting.
 I’ll put them down as one of my next targets.
 I won’t let you do that!
 How did…?
 Yup.
 My Ninjutsu is Ninja Art Magnet.
 It’s like this!
 I will live, no matter what…
 This is your graveyard.
 I will return those words right back at you.
 You!
 Then.
 There!
 Damn! 					What’s going on?!
 What should I do? I can't find Choji.
 I'm sure that he's somewhere hiding his presence, but…
 This is… Naruto’s forehead band.
 Naruto…
 I grew up drinking iron.
 That’s why I can use the iron
 that has accumulated in my body and turn myself into a magnet.
 This rocky mountain contains lots of iron,
 making it my invincible battle-field.
 Change yourself into magnet…?
 By the way, I could also change the things I touch into magnets.
 I’ve already changed the rocks behind you into powerful magnets.
 So what are you trying to do?!
 I mean this! Ninja Art Magnet: Infinite Meteors!
 Second hit! Third hit!
 Naruto!
 Your friend… I’ll take good care of her.
 Hinata! Don’t come!
 He is…
 He is…a dangerous…opponent…
 Naruto!

 It’s frustrating, but I can’t win against him if I fight him head on.
 At this rate, Naruto will…
 No, no, I won’t let that happen.
 I will discover the weakness of his Jutsu.
 I won’t give up! I’ll stop him, no matter what!

 I’m going to risk everything in this single attack!

 Sure enough, you’ve also got side-effects from the star training…
 Even if this life should end…
 I’ll never forgive you!
 Lord Akahoshi!
 What?
 You be a good boy!
 It’s a simple mission.
 We’ll be able to come back home right away.
 Right! Have a safe journey.
 Mother!
 Mother!
 Mother!
 Sumaru…!
 Mother!
 Sumaru!
 Oh, no!
 Lord Akahoshi. Why would you do such a thing?
 Is it true then…?
 Give it back…
 Hold it!
 Farewell.
 Wh-What?
 Then it was Lord Akahoshi
 who knocked everyone out and took Sumaru away?
 A sensei who does something like that
 to students who believe in him is unforgivable!
 Why in the world…? Why would you do such a thing?
 It’s all for the sake of the village…
 It’s for the sake of taking back the star she stole!
 Even if that were the case,
 that doesn’t make for a reason to cause Sumaru pain!
 That person is Sumaru’s mom!
 M-My…mother…
 Exactly!
 However, even if she is your mother, she’s now your enemy!
 The person before you is the woman who stole the star
 and attempted to bring about the doom to our village!
 That’s wrong!
 Sumaru’s mom just hid the star
 in order to save everyone from the pain of the training!
 Foolishness! Being able to die for the sake of the village
 is a Shinobi’s long-cherished dream!
 Isn’t that right, Sumaru?!
 You’re going to become the Hoshikage and put to shame
 the Five Great Hidden Villages that treated us with contempt, right?
 Yes… I want to become the Hoshikage and put them to shame…
 Show your foolish mother your determination!
 Yes… I can die if it’s for the sake of the village.
 Sumaru!
 Don’t do anything stupid, Sumaru!
 His Chakra is in synch with Akahoshi’s.
 Sumaru is being controlled!
 What?!
 Exactly… I have Sumaru’s life in the palm of my hand.
 Lady Natsuhi.
 I shall give you the ultimate choice!
 Will you take the star?
 Or…your son’s life?
 Wait!
 What’s the matter, Lady Natsuhi?
 Have you realized your own foolishness?
 Lady…
 You win, Akahoshi.
 Sumaru!
 You did it!
 Excellent. How did you get it?
 Simple, Lady Natsuhi returned it with good grace.
 Lady!
 That’s dirty!
 Sumaru!
 Sumaru…
 Is that person…really…?
 What’re you doing?!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – You…! I won’t forgive you! – You…! I won’t forgive you!
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi, I’m your employer.
 – That doesn’t make any difference! – That doesn’t make any difference!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Neji!
 Why, Neji? I can’t stand this either.
 No! From here on is an issue for the Hidden Star.
 It’s none of our concern!
 That being said, are we just going to leave them be?
 Anything further would be beyond the scope of the mission…
 The Leaf must not betray the client of the accepted mission, right?
 Damn it!
 Oh well.
 The star has returned. I’ll overlook everyone’s actions today.
 Those who wish to continue to live for the sake of the village, come with me…
 B-But…Sumaru is…
 Forsake the son of the traitor.
 Pull out!
 Yes, my lord!
 I’m sorry. I must not leave Sumaru behind.
 Rogue Ninja!
 Hokuto! You’ll regret this!
 Well, do as you like!
 That jerk…!
 Hey, look…!
 It’s called Natsuboshi.
 It’s the other name for the planet Mars, right?
 It seems it’s the same name as Sumaru’s mom…
 Sumaru thinks that star is protecting him.
 I bet Lady Natsuhi was also looking at that star.
 I’m moved.
 The hearts of parent and child are connected!
 Yeah…
 How’re the two doing?
 They’re resting comfortably now…
 But Akahoshi attack the mother took
 when her body was weakened from the effects of the star is a fatal one.
 Her Chakra Network is in shreds and it will mean certain death
 if she uses that Jutsu even one more time…
 Say what?! But Old Lady Tsunade could…
 Who knows…?
 Damn it! That Akahoshi jerk is unforgivable!
 I’ll kick his butt!
 Naruto…! You still don’t get it?
 But he’s a huge scoundrel.
 That’s right!
 The Leaf would lose credibility
 if we do something like betraying a client.
 But we can’t leave things be, right?
 Well, I also understand what Neji’s saying.
 We must ask the Lady Hokage for instructions.
 That’s right.
 Anyway, let’s take those two to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Yeah… The Hidden Star matter will come after that.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 Mother.
 You’re probably angry, aren’t you, Sumaru…?
 Of course, you would resent me… who abandoned the village
 and went so far as to entrust you to someone else.
 How often I attempted to take you with me…
 But I kept telling myself that
 I couldn’t make you happy since I had become a Rogue Ninja…
 with this body that could give out at any time
 due to the star training.
 Stay away!
 I often had the same dream.
 A dream where I chase after you two, crying.
 Sumaru.
 Mother!
 I kept telling myself
 that my mother was not a cold-hearted person
 who would leave me behind…
 You had died.
 Like that man, the Third Hoshikage said.
 He said you had been killed by a Ninja from some other land,
 died and turned into a star…
 He said you had turned into the Natsuhiboshi…!
 Sumaru…
 Mother!
 Even so…
 Even so…I wanted you to take me with you.
 Sumaru…
 I was lonesome… Mother…
 Natsuboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I cried…
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a child who has gone afar
 He can't be found. though I search all day
 My sad dreams come once more
 Hey! Sumaru! Wake up, Sumaru!
 Where’s the lady? Your mom.
 Hey, where’d she go?
 What?!
 This is bad…
 Mother!
 Even if it costs my life, I can’t let that star be…
 There mustn’t be any more sad mothers and children!
 Can’t let it happen. lf she gets reckless…
 and ends up using that Jutsu again…
 It became the village’s power and protected the village.
 I didn’t want to have to destroy it…
 But star, you have caused pain and suffering
 to one too many of the children…
 Forgive me…
 Akahoshi…
 Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Beast!
 Sumaru…
 So your strength has given out? How tragic.
 Mother…
 Hey, what’s the matter?
 It couldn’t be! Lady Natsuhi is…
 Mother died!
 As of this moment,
 I, Akahoshi, shall bear the name of Fourth Hoshikage!
 I shall announce the first mission as Hoshikage.
 The Rogue Ninja, Sumaru and Hokuto,
 and the Hidden Leaf Shinobi are enemies who demean us!
 If you find them attempting to enter the village,
 bring them down immediately!
 Yes, my lord!
 I will…
 I will get the one who killed my mother!
 Sumaru!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Damn that Akahoshi jerk! I can’t forgive him anymore.
 He’s diabolical.
 Hey, you two!
 I’ll pound him with a good one.
 Forget it. Don’t stick your nose into their internal affairs.
 Then, I’ll beat him into shape with my Lotus.
 That’d be the same as Naruto.
 Then what’re you saying we do?
 Anyway, I’m going, so.
 I’ll go with you.
 No. Do you guys want to start a war with the Hidden Star?
 Next time: “The Star’s Radiance.”

54,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Say, Grandma Tsunada, am I really so…?
 Come to think of it, recently I feel dull
 and I make more mistakes  with Jutsu than before.
 And, what’s more, even worse…
 I can’t eat more than five of the large-size ramen noodles at Ichiraku…
 Might I perhaps have some terrible illness?!
 Come on, and tell me. I’m prepared to hear the worst!
 You are in good health.
 Huh?
 Hey! That’s Bushy Brow’s medical record, isn’t it?
 Recently he’s been avoiding his regular check-ups.
 Bring him in, will you?
 Huh? But, what about me…?
 You are stupid. That’s all!
 Be on your way!
 – Put your clothes back on, you idiot! – Yes!
 Unbelievable!
 How was it?
 I’m fit as a fiddle!
 I could tell that just by looking at you.
 What’s that all about?
 He doesn’t seem to be in a very good mood, does he?
 Oh, by the way, have you seen Bushy Brow?
 No, but I know where he is.
 These days, you can always find him here.
 Oh…
 2954… 2955…
 2956… 2957… 2958…
 That’s just amazing…
 Even after having surgery for the kind of injury
 that could prevent him from continuing on as a Ninja…
 – Bushy Brow! 					– Lee!
 Bushy Brow!
 Lee…
 It’s nothing.
 Grandma Tsunada told me to bring you for your regular check-up.
 It slipped my mind. I’ve been feeling fine lately, so I just…
 You don’t look like it though.
 HIDDEN LEAF HOSPITAL
 Rest for a while.
 You are forbidden from engaging in any missions or training for the duration.
 There is cumulative damage to your Chakra Network.
 You were once injured so badly
 that you had to give up on being a Ninja for a while.
 It’s my self-rule.
 Your self-rule?
 Yes! To never forget my original intentions!
 As long as I keep on trying, I will be able to continue on as a Ninja!
 All right.
 I will remove you from active duty for a while,
 but you may continue training. Just don't overdo it.
 Yes!
 In particular, I prohibit you to use Hidden Lotus!
 Got that?
 Y-Yes…
 Oh! Hey, Bushy Brow, how did it go?
 What’s wrong? Hey!
 The results were bad.
 Judging from the way he looked, I’d say considerably…
 By “considerably,” do you mean that “considerably”?
 Yes. Considerable, to be sure.
 Considerable?!
 What are you so down about?! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 I heard the results of the exam. You have permission to train, don’t you?
 Yes, but the Hidden Lotus…
 That day, you were crying right there…
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hard all the way through.
 You have the power to bring your own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousand—
 no, one in a million chance that something goes wrong…
 I’m going to die with you!
 Ever since the time I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has been bringing you up to be a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 You believed me then and had the surgery. And it was successful.
 You must have faith in me one more time!
 If you can no longer use the Hidden Lotus,
 then strive to attain an even greater technique through your efforts!
 There are no limits in the face of your efforts.
 Sensei!
 You are a genius at effort!
 Yes, sir!
 I'll give you some training for the first time in quite a spell!
 First, dash to the Academy practice hall!
 Please instruct me!
 If you don’t get there in ten seconds,  it’s 500 push-ups!
 Right!
 The Third Super-Beast!
 It was rash of us to think we could make it in ten seconds, after all.
 Just as well!
 Five hundred…
 It’s been a long time since  I smelled this smell…
 Who is he?
 That’s Yagura. He’s been here for a week.
 An acquaintance asked me to determine whether he has aptitude as a Ninja.
 His name is Yagura, you say?
 He’s pretty good, isn’t he?
 Yes, he has the instincts for it.
 He absorbs the things I teach him like sand absorbs water.
 Oh! You’re Rock Lee, aren’t you?
 Y-Yes…
 I hear that you have superb techniques.
 Sensei has told me about you.
 No, nothing that great…
 Don’t be bashful, you.
 – Master Guy? 					– Yes?
 I would like to receive some instruction  from my senior.
 Fine, then. Begin!
 Huh?!
 Guy Sensei!
 You came to train, anyway.
 First, lend a bit of aid to your junior partner  and warm up.
 I see…
 He’s a spring chick who has just arrived, so try not to let him get hurt.
 Right.
 What’s Bushy Brow doing in  the Academy practice hall of all places?
 I thought his condition was considerably bad!
 Yes, considerably! Considerably!
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 I’m inexperienced, but please instruct me.
 Oh, please bear with me, too.
 Now, Lee and Yagura, I want you both to give it all you've got
 but to also observe the greatest courtesy.
 That is friendship! That is youth. Get ready. Fight!
 H-He’s fast!
 Let’s have you show me…
 The depth of the Taijutsu that Might Guy drilled into you!
 What power!
 Every single blow is heavy!
 I haven’t the strength to absorb them!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Closing off the escape path above  and strike from a low position…
 However…
 The Leaf Hurricane was defeated!
 Stop! Hold it right there!
 Lee! Are you all right?
 Pull yourself together, Bushy Brow!
 What was that that just happened?
 The Cross Method…
 Meeting the opponent’s kick
 and pinning his foot between the knee and elbow simultaneously—
 a “bone-crushing daring technique .”
 Where on earth did you learn that, Yagura!
 I didn’t intend to do that.
 My body just moved like that involuntarily…
 Sorry, Lee. Are you all right?
 If Lee hadn’t been wearing his weights, his ankle would have been crushed.
 It was a splendid move. Well then, let’s continue with the practice.
 Let’s stop here for today.
 I’ll take you to the hospital to have them look at it.
 No, I’m completely fine, I tell you…
 We knew from the health check-up
 that Bushy Brow’s injuries were considerable to begin with, didn’t we?
 Considerable!
 What was considerable?
 I’m telling you, just considerable, right?!
 – Probably considerable… – Considerable, I tell you!
 Even with the weights on, that speed…
 What was considerable?!
 Fortunately, there’s nothing wrong with the bone.
 I see.
 Um… When can I begin training again?
 Huh? What are you saying?!
 You’re going to need complete rest for a while.
 It’s amazing that your Achilles tendon  remained uninjured, you know…
 You said considerable, so…
 I misunderstood it to mean that he was in a considerable condition.
 But…
 he came out from the examining room looking very down,
 so I just assumed…
 To be sure, he seems dispirited.
 He was beaten by a trainee who isn’t even enrolled in the Academy.
 A trainee? Lee?
 Yes, a kid who has been studying Taijutsu for only one week.
 In any case, he was incredibly skilled, that…
 What’s it called…?
 The Cross Method!
 Yes, that!
 He's a genius to deploy that at the instant!
 I hope Lee isn’t feeling down, though.
 If he were the kind of guy to get downhearted about a thing like that,
 Lee would have quit being a Shinobi a long time ago.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 When Lee was in the Academy,
 he was told that he had neither the talent for Ninjutsu,
 nor any talent for Genjutsu.
 Had it been me, I would have given up long ago.
 But Lee got to where he is now purely through effort and persistence.
 If he can just heal his injuries,
 he’ll soon outstrip anyone with natural talent alone.
 – That’s true. – Darn right!
 But…
 I’ve heard that if you train too hard,
 you can wreck your body and become a decrepit…
 Don't say such a thing! You’re talking about Bushy Brow!
 I’m only kidding. Just a slip of the tongue.
 – Don’t even say that in jest! – Decrepit?
 I know, I know.
 But actually, we are grateful to Lee.
 Huh? Grateful?
 Yes, grateful.
 Okay, today I’m going to teach you about self-rule.
 Self…
 …rule, you say?
 Yes! Yes! Yes!
 Please teach me! Me! Me!
 All right, ready?
 To all things there are principles,
 and to efficiently make use of things in daily life, human beings have rules.
 Okay, today I have something good to give you all.
 – Something… 					– …good?
 This!
 O-Oh!
 These tights of the type that I habitually use…!
 They have outstanding ventilation and moisture-wicking properties!
 Developed for ultimate ease of movement, it's a complete of of super-athletic wear!
 If you wear them when you’re training, you’ll feel the difference immediately!
 You won’t be able to do without them!
 Next thing you know, you’ll be wearing them all the time!
 Yes, yes, yes! Please, by all means, give me a pair!
 Oh, I got a pair of those myself. They look cool, don’t they?
 Oh… Is that so?
 If it weren’t for Lee…
 This is youth!
 This is guts!
 This is Harutaro Minami, spring chicken of the South!
 – You got that all wrong! – You got that all wrong!
 I’m really glad that we’ve had Lee around.
 Yeah, me too…
 I’m sure a C-rank mission would feel insufficient for you,
 but there’s nobody left to ask but you.
 Leave it to me.
 Oh, by the way, there’s someone I’d like to take with me…
 Yagura!
 When my foot heals, let’s train together aga--?
 I feel no need to take lessons from you.
 Even ruling out the fact that you were wearing weight,
 there seems to be nothing worth stealing from you…
 Stealing?
 After all, skills acquired purely through effort
 make you nothing but a pale imitation of Guy Sensei.
 What did you say?!
 As proof of that, even Sensei has given up on you.
 That can’t be!
 Guy Sensei promised me…
 that his own Way of Ninja was to turn me into a splendid Ninja, too!
 Well then, I wonder why he’s gone so far as to ask me
 to come on a mission with him for practical training…
 Not you, but me!
 You?
 Too bad. There’s no way effort can win out over talent.
 Wait!
 Did Sensei really asked you to…?
 No, it…can’t be true…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wh-What is it?
 Yagura has been injured and is under protection.
 What? Guy was with him. What on earth happened?
 No! Yagura is said to have been attacked before reaching Hidden Leaf Village.
 Then the trainee Yagura that accompanied Guy is…
 A total imposter.
 Damn it, one nuisance after another…!
 So, these three are the ones that can be mobilized?
 What shall we do?
 Fine! Have Neji, Tenten, and Naruto…
 these three go after Guy and the phony Yagura!
 Right!
 Wait!
 Have Sakura keep an eye on Lee.
 If he learns about this,
 he’s apt to dash out, even in the shape he’s in.
 Right!
 Are you sure that Intense Brow Sensei went this way?
 Without a doubt!
 His destination was the Land of Mountain Streams.
 He must have gone through this forest.
 There’s another way to go, cutting through the mountains,
 but it’s too dangerous.
 Yagura, are you with me?
 Yes, Guy Sensei!
 Don’t slow down!
 Take each step after first taking the measure of the mountain terrain!
 Right!
 Lee could run through here blindfolded.
 What’s wrong? Yagura?
 Oh no!
 Yagura! Where are you?! Yagura!
 Yagura!
 He may be a genius, but he’s still a trainee…
 I wonder if I expected too much from him…
 Yagura!
 What? Were you in such a place?
 Wooden Training Dummies for kung fu training…
 Oh my… It takes me back to my youth.
 I trained with a burning spirit on the same kinds of Wooden Dummies.
 It makes my body to just start moving uncontrollably.
 But why are there Wooden Dummies in such a place?
 Who in the world…?
 And for what purpose?
 They move well for dummies.
 But, after all, they just look like automated dolls.
 They only have one pattern of movement,
 and no matter how many of them there are,
 their reach only extends for a diameter of 3.5 meters,
 so they cannot attack.
 What? Mister, you can move?!
 What the heck?!
 Hey? Can’t you see anything yet? Neji!
 Even using the Byakugan, I can’t find a single footprint.
 They can’t have gotten that far away, can they?
 They wouldn't have used excessively dangerous mountain paths either…
 However they seem to be able to move,
 they’re just stick figures crawling over the surface of the ground…
 Mister, you can jump, too?!
 Not just yet!
 Wh-What a…!
 pleasant, high-energy training place…!
 6,985… 6,986… 6,987… 6,988
 6,989… 6,990… 6,991…
 – There is no limit to training. – 6,992…
 – Even if I cannot use my legs, – 6,993…
 – my upper half is still in good shape. – 6,994…
 – Guy Sensei thinks… – 6,995…
 – my training is inadequate. – 6,996…
 – That’s why he compared me with Yagura. – 6,997… 6,996…
 – to show me that I wasn't doing enough. – 6,998… 6,999…
 7,000!
 – I have faith in Guy Sensei! – 7,001… 7,002…
 They’re moderately powerful, but…
 their movements are monotonous.
 Or…so I thought…!
 Shall I say I am outnumbered? There seems to be no limit to them!
 Wh-What is this sound?
 What?!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 I thought I knew, but you do have incredible power, after all.
 To think you have such an amazing kick.
 Looks like I have to put out everything in myself.
 Then I would put everything I've got into this too.
 Fine! Why don’t  you come at me with intent to beat me?!
 Please forgive me Guy Sensei.
 But to me, this is the moment…
 – to follow through with my own Ninja Way! – to follow through with my own Ninja Way!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 The fifth battle…
 Tenten, Temari…come forward!
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 Now…The second one from the Land of Sand, huh…
 Do your best!
 – Tenten! – It looks like it's going to be interesting.
 Begin!
 Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru
 Go for it, Tenten!
 Believe in your own strength, Tenten!
 We’re behind you, Tenten!
 Knock her with all your strength!
 That’s good!
 Cheer her on more, more, more with passion, Lee!
 Yeah!
 These guys are noisy!
 That spacing is just what I’d expect from Tenten,
 not too close, not too far.
 Attacks or defense, she can respond to either one.
 What happened?
 Please begin.
 Are you planning to wait out and see how I make my move?
 Let me just tell you,
 once I start my attack you’ll be over in a second.
 You’re trying to be cool and see what I do first…
 A hundred years too early!
 It doesn’t matter to me, come first.
 You said it…
 Well, I won’t hold back.
 They missed?
 That’s impossible!
 What happened? ls that a warm-up?
 Or are you scared and your aim is off?
 I thought I would enjoy it a little bit more,
 but evidently it’s not promising.
 No way!
 I can’t believe Tenten’s attack missed!
 It’s unbelievable indeed.
 Tenten’s weapons...
 always hits the mark ten out of ten times.
 There no reason for them to miss.
 That’s right... She didn’t miss.
 She was made to miss.
 As always, she’s being disagreeable.
 How foolish…
 How disgraceful!
 Huh?
 Sand wins again.
 We don’t know that yet.
 We know.
 How? 					How do we know?
 Explain it so I understand!
 Stupid... As if I'd do such a bothersome thing.
 Shikamaru said it so, surely that’s how it is.
 These guys are hard to understand.
 Calm down…
 Don’t let her get to you…
 One.
 Two.
 Three…
 If it’s gonna get dodged,
 I just have to make it impossible to!
 So she’s measuring the spacing, next one is going to be the big attack.
 I get it…
 So, that fan is the secret.
 If so…
 How about…this?!
 No way!
 My flying weapons!
 Is there a secret mechanism in the fan…?
 This is…
 the first star.
 There are two more.
 When the third star appears,
 you will lose.
 Tenten!
 Don’t be taken in by your opponent, be calm!
 Be calm!
 I know…
 Lee, I really intended to use this in the main battle,
 not the preliminary round--
 but it looks like I can’t do it that way.
 She’s already going to use it?
 Pulling out two scrolls?
 What does she intend to do?
 Hah! No matter what you do, it won’t work.
 Rising Twin Dragons!
 Even if you increase the amount, it’s still the same!
 Second star!
 I’m not done yet!
 Did I do it?
 Third star.
 She disappeared!
 Where is she?
 I’m over here!
 Darn--!
 Ninja Art!
 Wind Scythe Jutsu!
 Tenten!
 Chakra is enfolded in that wind.
 Huh?!
 Tenten fought well…
 But she won’t be able to escape from that twister.
 T-That’s awful.
 Tenten…!
 How boring... really.
 To think she completely intercepted Tenten’s weapon attacks.
 This is ridiculous!
 What’s going on with her…?
 It’s just like Shikamaru said, it’s the Sand’s win.
 That’s why I said it.
 There’s no reason for us to lose here.
 The Land of Sand is to be feared…
 Temari wins the fifth battle.
 Oh no!
 Nice catch.
 What are you doing?!
 Is that something you do to an opponent who fought to the utmost?!
 You’re annoying!
 Take that trash away already!
 Stop! Lee!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 What?!
 You’re just like you look…
 You’re dull too.
 What did you say?!
 Stop! Lee!
 Guy Sensei!
 Temari.
 Come up quick, you’ve been declared the winner.
 Don’t keep company with that awful-looking guy and his chaperone forever.
 What…?!
 That’s enough, Lee.
 Gentlemen of Sand…
 I wonder if I may give you a word of warning.
 This kid is strong.
 You should prepare yourselves.
 Picking a fight with the Sand…
 I absolutely wouldn't want to do it with those guys.
 T-They’re all awesome guys…
 Don’t lose to those guys!
 Naruto!
 S-Sakura.
 Sakura… Are you okay already?
 Never mind that, you should worry about yourself!
 Huh? Me? I don’t have an injury or anything.
 That’s not what I mean.
 If you lose here, it’s a point of dishonor.
 You’d be ashamed to face Sasuke!
 Y- Yeah.
 And…
 Thanks for earlier…
 No!
 Sakura!
 You did your hardest to get here!
 You’ll disgrace women if you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 If it weren’t for your stupid cheering at that time…
 I would have been soundly beaten by Ino.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Y-You!
 Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next!
 Next! 					Next is my turn!
 Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin
 Darn!
 It’s me.
 Shikamaru, don’t lose!
 – Show us that you’re a real man! – All right, all right.
 Get her with the 16 combo, go!
 – Win Shikamaru! – Ino’s become super energetic.
 You go for it!
 That guy manipulates shadows.
 Be careful of the shadows…
 I won’t be beaten by a stupid technique like that.
 Shikamaru!
 Bash that one around! And while you're at it...
 Man, what a pain.
 Furthermore, my opponent is a woman… lt's hard to get to it.
 If that’s what you think, I’ll end this quickly.
 Go, go! Shikamaru!
 Well, you could say that I know these guys’ raw power
 from that incident from the second test…
 I don’t know anything about this one’s Jutsu.
 On top of that, she’s seen my Jutsu…
 – The sixth battle. – That being said, for me…
 Shikamaru versus Kin!
 Begin!
 I can only do this.
 One trick pony, huh…?
 Shut up!
 Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 That Jutsu!
 It’s nothing if I just pay attention to the movement of your shadow!
 Bells…?
 Heh, that’s a classic.
 Next, you’ll throw Senbons with bells
 and Senbons without bells at the same time, right?
 I’ll respond to the sound of the bells, intending to dodge them.
 But I won't notice the quiet Senbons, and, ouch.
 Is that right?
 You’re a chatty guy!
 So in order to not get caught by the shadow Senbons…
 I'm alert to the trick and look closely…
 What?!
 Behind?!
 String?
 Darn it!
 Too late!
 Shikamaru!
 He took that pretty bad.
 It wasn’t tat bad, look closely.
 Huh?
 F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.
 Now it’s my turn!
 That’s not going to happen.
 W-What’s this?
 That happens to anyone who hears my bell.
 The sound vibration of this special bell
 reaches the brain directly from the ear drum.
 And then it will make you hallucinate.
 It’s useless!
 You can’t avoid the sound of my bell by doing...
 that... that... that... that... that...
 Shoot! Which one? Which is the real one?
 You can’t do anything, can you?
 Your shadow, which was your faint hope, doesn’t even know where to stretch to…
 Well… I’ll cook you slowly.
 Taking me lightly…!
 This time it’s five, next time seven…
 I’ll continue until you become a hedgehog.
 Y-You’re lying, you brat!
 Huh?!
 You’d end it soon…
 That’s what you said in the beginning, isn’t it?
 I see, you can’t endure the pain and want to be eased.
 Well, I’ll finish it here.
 It’s your death warrant.
 W-What?!
 M-My body…
 At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success.
 W-What are you saying?
 No way! Your shadow isn’t anywhere...
 You don’t realize it yet?
 I-It can’t be…
 It's just that, you fool!
 A thread at this height can’t have a shadow.
 I can stretch and shrink my own shadow.
 The shadow is gradually getting thicker.
 This wasn’t the shadow of the thread…
 That's right. I stretched my shadow and made it narrow,
 so it looked like the shadow of a thread and stuck it on you.
 But… How do you win with that?
 I’m just gonna move the same way as you.
 Annoying.
 Be quiet and watch.
 Stupid!
 If you continue like this and attack…
 You, too, 					will be wounded!
 I know that.
 No way! You're...!
 We’re gonna throw shuriken at each other.
 How far will we go…?
 Fool, stop it!
 You're only talk...
 And that one's a goner.
 If you’re a shinobi,
 you have to grasp the situation and the layout when you battle.
 Even though we made the same movements…
 the distance of the walls behind each of us was different.
 I just used the shuriken and
 called attention away from the wall behind us.
 Winner! Shikamaru Nara.
 Good job Shikamaru!
 Cool!
 Me next…
 Me next… Me next…!
 That guy’s dull and plain, but that was kinda cool.
 Shoot!
 I’m the only one left.
 And the next match.
 The people left are one Sound ninja,
 me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.
 And that Sand guy…
 Just please spare me from that guy.
 This year’s rookie looks quite challenging…
 Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
 It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
 What we’ve been waiting for!
 It’s finally my turn!
 Yeah! Lucky us!
 If it’s this guy we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
 Yahoo!
 – If I’m not next, Sakura will despise me... – I'm gonna do it!
 – and call me Bushy Brow. – I'm gonna go for it!
 – If I’m not next. Sakura will... – Just watch me! Yay!
 This Lee kid, he’s just like Guy was in the past…
 Do your best, Naruto.
 Leave it to me.
 Well Naruto, show us…
 how much you’ve grown.
 I’m going to do it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Darn that Kiba!
 I hold back a little bit and he rides my brain.
 Yap, yap, yap, yap, it’s annoying! Believe it!
 Just quit talking tough, and use your dog or whatever, and come at me!
 I don’t know what kind of training you’ve done,
 but I’m the man who’s going to become Hokage.
 You’re the one who’s going to get his butt kicked.
 Next time: “Akamaru Unleashed! Who’s Top Dog Now?”

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at? 10.01	01:51:41:26	01:51:45:16	                       When Time Stands Still
 As long as the score isn’t settled,
 the clock inside my heart will remain stopped in the past!
 Lord Sagi, if you live for revenge,
 your heart will sink into darkness!
 If it means that I am able to carry out my revenge…
 I don’t care if my heart sinks into darkness!
 That’s exactly right.
 I hold a grudge against you, I hate you…
 My only purpose in living has been to kill you…
 Sasuke!
 I've…
 I’ve survived!
 I’m finished with messing around with you Leaf Village guys.
 I will go to Orochimaru!
 I can’t…let you go there…
 I cannot allow…!
 you to go there!
 I wasn’t able to stop a comrade who was sinking into darkness…
 However, I won’t let you go there, no matter what!
 You pesky little…
 If you get in my way, I’ll consider you an enemy too!
 There’s no way you guys… could ever understand!
 It’s a trick device!
 No one can hinder my desire!
 What was that?!
 It’s no good!
 We can’t get out!
 Farewell! Ninja of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Lightning Blade!
 There!
 How did you figure it out…?!
 Because I’ve seen your Jutsu with these very eyes…
 I remember now… 					You are…
 Hatake…Kakashi…
 The Copy Ninja with the Sharingan…
 Your Jutsu doesn’t even faintly mirror that of Gaara’s…
 You’ve only scratched its surface…
 All you’re doing is leaving your main body elsewhere
 and using your Chakra to manipulate the rocks and sand…
 We are nomads…
 ridiculed as lower-ranked Shinobi without a village…
 That’s why we travel around the country, stealing Jutsu, sharpening our skills,
 struggling to one day find our way into a place in the sun.
 But no matter how dedicated our efforts are…
 to think there are dimensions that cannot be transgressed…
 That’s the direction of the Feudal Lord’s palace…
 Hurry up! Lord Sagi’s thought to be buried beneath there!
 Damn it! We really got screwed…
 That jerk!
 What a jerk… Gimme a break!
 What happened…
 Huh?
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Sagi totally squashed us just now and went off somewhere!
 Gimme a break… that guy’s some kind of jerk!
 Please don’t blame him for the things he has done.
 But…!
 He is himself, but not himself right now.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 He is obsessed with avenging
 his father and younger sister’s deaths.
 I believe he is possessed by the ghost of the late Lord Owashi.
 Oh come on… Stop joking…
 That’s not necessarily a joke.
 Stop it! That kind of thing gives me the creeps!
 Get a grip! This isn’t the time to be squabbling over things like that!
 What’s important right now is to find Sagi!
 But we have no idea where he went.
 If he is possessed,
 it is certain that he will return to take revenge…
 And moreover…very soon…
 Elder Brother…lf I were to lose you too, after having lost our father…
 I could not go on living…
 Father…Elder Brother…
 I shall join with you…
 Elder Brother!
 Elder Brother… I will avenge this without fail…
 I will once more restart the hands of time for you, Elder Brother,
 whose time was brought to a standstill…
 Until the day that wish is realized…
 I will live as you, Elder Brother, as Sagi!
 Sagi’s temperament is such that he will undoubtedly come here for Moso.
 It’s actually quite convenient
 that Lord Sagi comes all the way here to see me…
 Even if I can’t get my hands on Sagi, the Feudal Lord,
 it’s not a crime to kill him as the Cursed Warrior.
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What a joke… A ghost appearing in a child’s toy…
 You have some nerve appearing here like this…
 Cursed Warrior…
 Lord Sagi…
 Huh…who are you…?
 Aren’t you the high and mighty Moso?
 I won't answer to words like that
 from the likes of a ghost.
 Damn you!
 That’s right…
 Moso is just a fictitious name used to deceive the world…
 My name is Hoki…
 The Leader who heads the Wandering Ninja…
 In place of not having a village, we the Wandering Ninja
 steal Jutsu from every village we pass through and make them our own!
 But our family has tired of living for so long as nomads.
 And we have been searching for a Land to call our home.
 I see…
 From the very start,
 you came here to the Land of Bird with the intention of taking it over!
 There’s no way that somebody like you,
 who was born destined to become a feudal lord…
 could understand the suffering of Wandering Ninja
 who do not have a homeland!
 I don’t see a problem…
 with the Wandering Ninja seeking a safe homeland.
 After all, your father was someone who easily trusted others…
 He never even suspected anything
 when I switched with the monk Moso, highly reputed for his virtue,
 and neared him…
 He misinterpreted my Genjutsu of deception
 as being the holy power of the virtuous Moso
 and put me on the fast track…
 The only person who suspected me was Komei.
 I assassinated Owashi and drove Komei away…
 Y-You jerk… so it was you, after all!
 And the last step is to kill you, Sagi.
 If I can do that, I will have accomplished what I set out to do!
 You jerk! I won’t forgive you!
 Revenge for my clan!
 You are…?!
 Yes, that’s right!
 My name is Toki!
 Lady Toki…!
 I will avenge my father and brother’s death!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Look at that, Toki… Our shadows are overlapping, right…
 That’s the Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 With this, you won’t be able to move anymore!
 But I wouldn’t have imagined that you would be the younger sister Toki…
 The Wandering Ninja will be successful in taking control of this land.
 You will die as Sagi just as you desire!
 Lady Toki! Keep your composure!
 Chishima…
 So you were alive, huh…
 I was unaware of your feelings, Lady Toki.
 Chishima is most ashamed!
 Take this and die!
 I overheard everything just now.
 Sagi, I mean, Toki! Leave the rest to me!
 Naruto…?!
 That’s not gonna happen! You will die by your own shadow!
 The shadow has nothing to do with it!
 You’re just under the influence of his Genjutsu!
 What?!
 Lady Toki…
 Shadow Possession is Shikamaru’s Clan's Secret Jutsu!
 There’s no way you could even hope to imitate it!
 Not only is your identity fake, but your Ninjutsu is too!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Naruto!
 The heavens are watching your villainy!
 There is no way we will forgive you!
 Why you Leaf Ninja… But it’s only a Clone Jutsu!
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 They have substances?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Sasuke’s Phoenix Flower Jutsu is much more awesome!
 It’s my turn this time!
 Damn you!
 Kakashi Hatake…
 So you’re here too, huh…
 Hoki, the leader who heads the Wandering Shinobi…huh…
 I’ve heard rumors about you…
 So you’re a Shinobi who wanders from place to place like a bat…
 Ninja from a rich village can’t possibly imagine circumstances like ours…
 Like hell I’ll understand it…
 The Leaf are taught that the Way of Ninja is to become a Ninja who can endure…
 People like you who trick people and wishfully try to seize land
 have no right to call themselves Shinobi!
 Elitist!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Damn! That’s a real dragon!
 No way!
 Wait…!
 Wait!
 Over there, huh…
 What’s up with that?
 So the Summoning Dragons were fake too …
 He fled off somewhere…
 Inside the mansion!
 I’m not letting him get away!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hey you…wait!
 Where did he vanish to?!
 Hey, Leaf Ninja…
 Huh?!
 Wh-What?!
 If you want to have Toki back, come over here…
 H-How?!
 Take that boat to come over here…
 Genjutsu?
 Are you scared, you Leaf apprentice Ninja?
 I’m not an apprentice!
 This place…don’t tell me it’s…
 What’s that?
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Chishima…
 believed in you until the very end.
 He truly loved this land…
 and he worried about his friends from the bottom of his heart!
 And yet…
 And yet…!
 I won't forgive you, you bastard!
 I'm gonna beat the hell outta you!

57,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Heh! It’s over…
 Losing is not an Option
 What?!
 Just barely…
 That was a close one.
 But…I was able to throw it off just a little.
 There’s no mistake.
 He’s now realized the secret of the Byakugan.
 What’s the meaning of this? How?!
 How was he able to throw it
 a whole six inches from his vital point?!
 I see… That Chakra!
 He was emitting Chakra the whole time
 and covered the area surrounding him!
 And in a wide range to that extent.
 No wonder he was able to detect the arrow and
 throw off the trajectory of it.
 But constantly emitting that much Chakra is a death throe…
 If he doesn’t go that far, he can’t dodge.
 In other words, there’s no mistake.
 It’s as I hypothesized…
 The arrow earlier was totally invisible to him!
 He doesn’t carry out useless attacks…
 And from the results, he accurately examines the information.
 And…he’s also discovered the weakness of my eyes…
 Impressive.
 Of all the enemies I’ve fought until now,
 this guy’s the strongest!
 He has 360-degree sight.
 And he unfailingly detects attacks
 that penetrate the roughly 150-feeot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there were Kunai Knives he couldn’t evade completely.
 Why couldn’t he evade them?
 Because he couldn’t see them!
 In other words, even his Visual Jutsu has a slight blind spot!
 Being unable to see Kunai Knives entering that blind spot,
 he’s unable to react.
 So he was dealing with attacks from the blind spot
 with that defense technique.
 And I analyzed all the attacks I carried out
 and grasped them perfectly.
 Right behind his first thoracic vertebra…
 there exists a blind spot expanding from a very small point.
 Indeed, if he moves and doesn’t stabilize the blind spot,
 it becomes difficult to aim there with an arrow.
 But such a trick…doesn’t fool me!
 Gentle Fist is pointless if you don’t come close to your enemy.
 And you can’t afford to think about approaching me at this point.
 It’s about how to escape now…
 Though whether you struggle or not, you’re going to die anyway.
 Heh… It seems you only have a little Chakra left.
 The fate of the small fry character in an easy game
 is to be destroyed right away!
 It’s useless!
 A thread?!
 I see, with this thread…
 This time, the trajectory was thrown off slightly by the trees, huh?
 If that’s the case…
 I’ll add some rotation this time.
 So even if it hits a tree,
 it’ll just cut through and the trajectory won’t be thrown off.
 And as before…
 I’ll control the arrow up until 150 feet away from him
 using a thread with Chakra flowing through.
 I’ll take aim at the moving target…
 and plunge the arrow into the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!
 He’s still standing up?
 He’s strong… He’s much stronger than me.
 I hardly have any Chakra left now.
 I probably won’t be able to evade his next attack completely.
 Is this it?
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Naruto… I wonder what you’d do.
 I’ve had enough.
 I can’t dodge it anyway.
 He’s stopped moving… Has he given up?
 But just to make doubly sure…
 Maximum destructive power with 120% accuracy.
 I’ve got him!
 This is it.
 Gentle Fist!
 Wh-What? He still…?!
 No! My attack just now should’ve made the kill.
 Substance with Chakra base…
 It’s meaningless against Gentle Fist.
 Gentle Fist…
 I see, in his final moments,
 he funneled the last Chakra through the thread!
 Eight crows…
 Again I couldn’t see one of them.
 What happened to him?
 He damaged several of my internal organs.
 But…I can still move.
 You failure…
 I told you… I don’t know when to quit!
 Why do you try to go against your destiny that much?
 Because I was called…a failure!
 But if you’re going to say it’s futile, you don’t have to do anything!
 After I become the Hokage, I’ll change Hyuga!
 The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
 I was careless…
 Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
 Don’t be whining about boring stuff like destiny and what not,
 and how it can’t be changed!
 Unlike me,
 you're not a failure.
 Naruto…
 Now it’s become the three of us…
 Don’t worry about such things.
 Both Choji and Neji will catch up right away.
 Choji had the trump card.
 And I’ve fought Neji in the Chunin exam, so I know…
 Know what?
 That he’s…a true genius. Believe it!
 I cannot lose…
 Whether he’s an enemy much stronger than me…
 or even if this body should fail me…
 I cannot lose!
 I have a reason why I cannot lose!
 I’ve had a hard time of it this time.
 I played too long…
 Huh?
 I can’t build up Chakra…
 How? You should’ve been instantly killed!
 How come you’re alive?!
 I couldn’t completely evade it anyway.
 So I was prepared to deliberately take the hit.
 And I knew of my own weakness much more than you do…
 There were eight crows, huh?
 This Byakugan has a blind spot.
 However, if I knew that your attack would only come from there…
 I could release my Chakra just to that blind spot and detect the attack.
 It’s not so difficult to make
 a move of just a few inches to throw off the aim.
 I’d suffer a serious injury, but instant death can be avoided.
 So you took the hit deliberately…?
 It doesn’t change the fact that you’re going to die here.
 How can you go that far?!
 “Of all the enemies,” you’re the strongest I’ve ever fought…
 But, there’s a reason why I cannot lose.
 Of all those I’ve ever fought, the strongest one said this to me…
 – Unlike me…you are not a failure! – Unlike me…you are not a failure!
 He said that.
 I’ve been called a genius all along.
 So I cannot lose.
 And for the sake of those guys who believe
 that this humdrum and small me is a genius!
 “The fate of the small fry character in a game is to be destroyed right away.”
 You said that, didn’t you?
 Look at this situation!
 Things like fate, isn’t determined by someone!
 I wonder…
 You also look like you’re going to die!
 Neji, live.
 More than anyone in the clan,
 you’re the man loved most by the Hyuga ability…
 I cannot die so easily.
 Even if you act tough, you can’t stem the current now…
 Master Sasuke ran to the Sound Village by his own wish.
 Sasuke is now in the darkness…
 No…
 Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me.
 There’s a person who can find him in the darkness and save him.
 Master Sasuke belongs to Lord Orochimaru.
 No matter who it may be, they can’t save…
 He can save him!
 Because…Naruto…you…
 You saved me from the darkness!
 Talking rubbish until the end…
 But…
 I haven’t been pushed this far since Kimimaro.
 Damn it…

 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…

 You guys did good work. Komei has confessed.
 It seems he plotted the Cursed Warrior…
 to mislead the public and to take the feudal lord position.
 Is that what Komei said?
 Yes. It turned out to be such a trifle.
 The Cursed Warrior vanishing
 was a soldier disguising himself as the Warrior
 using a strong nitrohydrochloric acid to melt his own flesh.
 It's empty again.
 With this, the Cursed Warrior incident is resolved.
 Now the Land of Birds should return
 to the beautiful and quiet land it used to be.
 Just a minute!
 But the Cursed Warrior still isn’t…!
 Don’t bother.
 But…!
 Now you are relieved of your duty.
 Have a safe journey back to your village…
 Why?!
 You said the one we saw first
 and the one last night were different, right?
 Perhaps there were multiple people disguised as the Cursed Warrior,
 not just one alone.
 If there was a person inside disguised,
 then how do you explain the Warrior flying?!
 As long as our mission has been ordered complete,
 there’s no reason to continue the mission in this land now.
 Besides, Komei confessed to the crime, right?
 But, it’s suspicious!
 I can’t go along with it if I don’t get the whole story!
 This land has its own circumstances.
 Getting too involved will cause trouble.
 Humph!
 Then I’ll just have to do it my way.
 Hold it.
 I’m the leader of this team.
 So what?!
 You look into the movements of the Cursed Warrior once more.
 Tenten and I will reinvestigate this incident from a different angle.
 What? But the mission’s over…
 You have a point with what you said.
 Everything is moving along too swimmingly.
 All right! Leave it to me.
 Huh?
 Where are you going, Naruto?
 Isn’t it obvious? To investigate the Cursed Warrior!
 What?
 Oh, Chishima.
 Um, Naruto just now…
 It’s nothing, it’s nothing.
 Did you have business with us?
 Oh, yes.
 You have all been so helpful to me the whole time…
 I feel so bad about that low payment…
 Additional money?
 We couldn’t…
 No, it’s the specialty of the Land of Birds,
 chicken wing buns filled with bean jam.
 Yakitori Tsurucho
 Thanks!
 Sure enough, this area’s fishy, believe it.
 It’s kind of time-consuming searching alone…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Ahh, long time no see. Are you giving me a snack?
 Why is it you guys?!
 Dad’s busy with stuff, so.
 No, I can’t have Boss Gama appearing, either…
 Well, I guess it can’t be helped.
 You guys have a better sense of smell than humans, right?
 You’re calling us puppies?!
 Geez! Toad authority has sure hit rock bottom!
 Gamatatsu, we’re leaving!
 Gamatatsu?
 Hey, Gamatatsu!
 A frog that pounces on a willow leaf?
 What’re you doing, you idiot?!
 Big Brother Gamakichi…
 I wonder what…this is?
 Whoa, it’s dark. lt’s night.
 Good night.
 Good morning.
 What’s this?
 It’s a kite painted black.
 A kite?
 Look up there!
 That’s a totally huge kite, believe it.
 I wonder if there was a big kite-flying festival or something.
 It’s rather plain for a festival kite…
 What?! What does that mean?
 Oh no!
 Hey! Where are you going?!
 I’m back.
 I get it… If one were to fly that in the cover of a dark night…
 A Cursed Warrior hanging onto the black kite
 would look like he was flying…
 With this, the mystery of the flying warrior is solved, believe it!
 Next…
 Someone was here on that night…
 What is it?
 The Cursed Warrior came out from here.
 It just looks like an old temple that isn’t used much at all.
 You’re right.
 Let’s go, Gamatatsu!
 But Big Brother Gamakichi, it’s nice and cool here.
 What’re you talking about?! ln such a hot and humid temple…
 Indeed, that’s a nice damp wind.
 See? Isn’t it comfortable?
 Draft from down below here…?
 What’s this?
 Wow! I wonder if a giant worm made this.
 Or a mole?
 All right, let’s check it out.
 I wonder how we should greet a mole if we were to meet one.
 Like I care!
 So Naruto is still investigating the Cursed Warrior, huh?
 I should probably inform Lord Moso.
 There was some trouble caused,
 but we have at last found a safe refuge.
 After him!
 Big Brother, where are we?
 Huh?! This place is…
 This is the residence of the feudal lord, isn’t it?
 Really? Residence of the feudal lord?
 No wonder it’s an impressive building.
 It was connected to this place?
 What was that sound?
 Oh! What a nice view.
 Hey! What're  you doing?!
 Shh! Keep quiet! We’ll be discovered.
 Big Brother Gamakichi!
 Uh, oh!
 You blockhead!
 Uh, umm… Good work with your duties!
 As for me, I’m not anyone suspicious!
 I was asked by the Superintendent Moso and
 I’m investigating the incident…
 It’ll make sense if I tell you about it!
 Oww!
 Lord Sagi! We have captured a suspicious man.
 What shall we do with him?
 What…? Oh!
 Oh. Sagi, bro! Hey! We met at the lake, didn’t we?
 Explain to them about me!
 I know no such person.
 What?!
 He’s not worth sending to the magistrate’s office.
 Lock him in the dungeon.
 Yes, my lord!
 Hey, that’s harsh! Come on, Sagi!
 Hey! Wait a minute! Come on, hey!
 Come on. This is a misunderstanding!
 I was just going after the Cursed Warrior!
 Umm, everything will make sense if you just ask Mr. Moso.
 You okay?
 Yo!
 I can’t be fighting the soldiers of my employer’s land.
 Geez. You had to go and get caught in that trap!
 Well, it’s cool. I can get out of a place like this right away
 if I just use both my hands.
 Hey, untie this.
 Right. Just a second.
 Wha--?!
 Th-The Cursed Warrior…?!
 Damn it!
 If I could just use both hands, this guy would be…!
 Big Brother, are we going to let things be?
 If things go wrong, we’d be sliced in two.
 I wouldn’t want that.
 Just a little more…
 Just a little more…!
 Sagi?!
 What’s going on here?
 You’re the other Cursed Warrior?
 But, why?
 They say people become disembodied spirits and avenge themselves…
 But that’s a lie!
 This watch has been handed down from generation to generation
 in the feudal lord family.
 It was supposed to be passed from father to son…
 But now along with that death, the watch has stopped ticking away.
 It must have been very sad…
 I am shamelessly living on only for the sake of revenge!
 I can go to hell if I can just complete my revenge!
 That’s no good!
 There is no way you could understand
 how someone who has had everything taken away from them feels!
 Like I know about stuff like that!
 But I, at least, know that living for the sake of revenge is wrong!
 You’re a feudal lord, aren’t you?
 Is revenge the job of a feudal lord?
 You know that’s not it.
 The true culprit Komei has been arrested.
 You should just leave the rest to Moso. Okay?
 It is no concern of yours…
 I must not let you live
 now that you have learned everything!
 As the thief who snuck into the residence of the feudal lord…
 your fate is a death sentence!
 No way…!
 This is creepy…
 This is the tomb of the successive generations of feudal lords, right?
 Yeah.
 That’s the tomb of the Lord Owashi…
 Byakugan!
 What’s this?
 What is it, Neji? What are you seeing?!
 There’s something poisonous in Owashi’s body.
 Was he assassinated…?!
 We’re surrounded.
 An announcement to the Ninja from the Leaf Village.
 A message has just now been delivered
 from the residence of the feudal lord!
 Your comrade has been arrested for infiltrating…
 the residence of the feudal lord…
 and his death sentence has been determined!
 Leave the Land of Birds at once!
 If you don’t, you will be executed here for the same crime.
 It doesn’t matter! Draw your bows!
 Neji, what should we do?
 Let’s go to the residence of the feudal lord.
 We’re going to save Naruto!
 You’re…
 Kakashi Sensei! Naruto’s in trouble!
 We have to go to the residence of the feudal lord immediately
 and save him…
 We can’t do that.
 Your mission is over.
 But!
 Don’t do anything other than the mission.
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Are we really going back to the village like this?
 I told you. Our mission in the Land of Birds is finished now.
 But then, what’ll happen to Naruto?
 We can’t interfere with this land’s internal affairs.
 No way…
 Sorry. The responsibility rests on me, the leader.
 Let it go… Sacrifice is a part of Shinobi missions.
 Next time: “The Death of Naruto.”

59,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 A Town of Outlaws!                           The Shadow of the Fuma Clan
 It seems that the most bustling traveler’s town in the Land of Rice Paddies
 is at the bottom of these mountains.
 You’re going to weird places again
 in the name of investigation, aren’t you, Pervy Sage?!
 Please stop it already!
 We had a rough time shaking off the bodyguards from the rip-off bar.
 I understand your point,
 but there’s no other way to find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Gee, I don’t like it either, but…
 This is truly a problem…
 But we have to do things we don’t like… Right?!
 Okay, let’s go!
 Naruto, Sakura, don’t drag your feet!
 Investigation, investigation! What a pain.
 He looks like he’s having fun.
 He hasn’t learned at all.
 Fuma Alley
 – Oww! 					– That's my line!
 This is even rougher than the traveler’s town before.
 Let’s just take a pass on this place and find Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Say…
 I don’t have any more money.
 I don’t have any more money either!
 Here!
 You guys go get some food with that
 and wait in the temple on the outskirts of town.
 Information accumulates in this kind of place,
 but it’s not good for you guys to see.
 I’ll sacrifice myself and check it out.
 He’s a surprisingly nice person…
 Sakura… You’re still so naïve.
 Where should I investigate first?
 Gee, how rough… lnvestigations are painful.
 Let’s leave the Pervy Sage be and check somewhere else.
 What’s the matter, Sakura?
 I don’t think… Sasuke’s in this land anymore.
 What’s the matter?!
 We won’t know that if we don’t investigate!
 Yeah, but…
 Our opponent is Orochimaru.
 Of course, things might not go easily.
 But you know…
 But I’m sure we’ll find him!
 Right.
 Naruto!
 You’re…the one from before?!
 This kid’s…hurt…
 You…?
 Naruto!
 Substitution, huh…?
 We let them get away.
 Don’t worry…
 My cute children are making a silver trail for us.
 They can’t escape from us now…
 It seems those two are petty Ninja from somewhere.
 But getting involved with us has sealed their fate.
 It’s unfortunate for them…
 The objective of those who sneak into this land is Lord Orochimaru, anyway.
 Sure enough, the skin of a young woman is supple.
 You’re mean!
 Eh? Oh, sorry sorry.
 By the way, have you guys heard rumors about the Sound Village?
 The Sound Village?
 I’ve never heard the name of such a village.
 I’ll tip you handsomely if you tell me.
 But I really don’t know.
 I’ve never heard of it.
 I’ve heard of it!
 One of my regulars knows a lot about it.
 Wanna come?
 Yeah.
 His home is in the back of this alley.
 Trapped like a rat.
 What, it’s a seedy old man! Hey! He’s got money, right?
 Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
 You punks! Stop the idle chatter and take care of him now!
 Right, boss!
 Getting infatuated with girls has sealed your fate! Rest in peace!
 Ninja Art: 					Needle Jizo.
 You punk…
 I’m in a hurry…
 I think it’d be best if you answer compliantly
 whether or not you know about Hidden Sound Village.
 You’re a fool if I look like a compliant person to you!
 You a Ninja?
 If so?
 Interesting!
 We’ve reduced ourselves to being thieves,
 but we’re a somewhat famous Shinobi clan around here!
 Instead of taking your life, I could hire you if you want!
 A Ninja, huh…
 Then I don’t need to go easy on you.
 Don’t be acting like a big shot, old man!
 Shut up, you squirt!
 A Ninja refers to one who endures.
 Those who couldn’t endure their hunger pangs
 and resort to use their diligently studied Jutsu for stealing
 are not called Ninja!
 I won’t let that pass!
 Thinking we’re fellow Shinobi, we took pity on you.
 Acting all conceited!
 Regret after being sliced in two!
 Fuma Ninja Blade Zanbato!
 Rasengan!
 You punk! How dare you do that to the boss!
 We won’t let you do any more than that!
 Oh?
 Hold it, you guys!
 I didn’t know you were so good!
 That Jutsu just now…
 I sense you must be a person of stature!
 If it’s all right, may I ask you your name?
 If you don’t know, then I shall tell you!
 Women become infatuated with his sex appeal.
 He’s strong against Shinobi, but has a soft spot for women!
 He exists in Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 And made his name known…
 Master Jiraiya, that’s me!
 What?!
 You guys bow your heads and beg for your lives!
 We’ll all be killed!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Although we didn’t know, being so rude to Master Jiraiya,
 reputed as one of the Legendary Sannin of the Leaf Village!
 We beg for your forgiveness!
 So my name’s known in this land, too…
 Well, it’s okay.
 So is it true that you know about Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Yes! There were many Ninja clans in the Land of Rice Paddies,
 including us Fuma.
 We divided up the roles amongst ourselves
 and the Ninja of this land were doing well in their own way.
 Until that man appeared…
 Who was that man?
 It’s regrettable to even speak of that name…
 It was Orochimaru!
 It’s okay! Rest easy!
 If germs get into the wound and you get tetanus,
 you won’t be saved.
 But fortunately, I have medicine, so let me treat you.
 They’re not coming.
 Just show us your wound.
 Well, huh?
 Naruto, go wait outside till my treatment is done. 164.01	01:37:53:04	01:37:53:24	Huh?
 Why do I have to be the only one chased out?!
 Jeez!
 I guess it can’t be helped.
 Don’t peek!
 I know.
 Okay, show me your wound.
 How mean…
 To hit me out of the blue…?
 Whoa, interesting.
 Naruto! You can come in!
 What?!
 A cute girl?
 Sakura! This girl! Who the heck is this girl?!
 How dense. It’s the Ninja from a moment ago.
 Come to think of it…
 Why…?
 I am Sasame Fuma.
 Sasame… Why were you being chased by those guys?
 If you like, try talking about it.
 We might be able to help.
 They were the Sound Ninja protecting Orochimaru’s residence.
 What?!
 I’m sorry for mistaking you guys as one of them the other day.
 That doesn’t matter!
 We’re also looking for Orochimaru!
 Would you please give us the details?
 Okay…
 It all started with the Feudal Lord of the Land of Rice Paddies
 launching an attack on a neighboring land
 in an attempt to expand the territory.
 The Land of Rice Paddies is a small land…
 And there aren’t that many Shinobi.
 It was a foolhardy attack. Losing was expected…
 And the Shinobi clans of this land
 who participated in the losing battle went to ruin…
 We the Fuma Clan as well.
 I hear that among the surviving Shinobi,
 there are those who have left the land
 and those who have stooped to become thieves.
 Even so, we’ve lived believing in a restoration of the clan
 and continued to live hiding in the shadows.
 At that time, an emissary of Village Hidden in the Sound appeared before us
 attempting to create the first full-scale Shinobi village in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 The emissary of the Sound Village said…
 My master Orochimaru is gathering all sorts of Jutsu!
 He has taken an interest in your Jutsu well.
 Depending on your work,
 you might be given the chance to serve the Feudal Lord!
 My cousin Arashi…
 was an up-and-coming star for the restoration of the clan…
 Arashi as a representative of the clan
 headed for Village Hidden in the Sound together with the emissary.
 But…
 And then…?
 We waited for a notice from Arashi, but…
 There is no word from him, huh?
 Damn it! He was tricked by that Orochimaru!
 Naruto!
 Oh…!
 Uh, even so, your cousin Arashi might be safe…
 We don’t know, right? And so…and so…
 Idiot…!
 I’m going to save Arashi!
 I have a small body and my power is weak.
 So no matter what I did…
 I did nothing but become a hindrance even in Ninjutsu training…
 But Arashi always saved me!
 Everyone in the village has already given up, but…
 So I’ll find Village Hidden in the Sound alone…
 And so you were chased by the Sound Ninja, right?
 This time, it’s my turn to save Arashi!
 Sasame!
 I…I want to be of help to Arashi!
 Naruto!
 Yeah…I know!
 We have to go to Village of the Sound to bring back Sasuke anyway, so!
 Now instead of one,
 it’s just that there are two guys for us to bring back.
 I’ll save your cousin, Sasame!
 Right!
 Eew! A spider…
 What’s this?!
 Naruto!
 Wha--! What’s this?!
 Ninja Art: Wind Spiders!
 My cute children made a path for me out of silver thread
 and told me where you guys were going.
 All three of you together will descend into hell while bearing the secret!
 Naruto! It’s the Ventriloquism Jutsu!
 He’s scattering his voice to multiple directions
 and covering up location and number!
 I get it! I leave this girl to you, Sakura!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Okay! Bring it on from anywhere!
 It’s a large number, but it’s just Clone Jutsu.
 No. Look closely, Jigumo!
 The threads are getting tangled.
 All of the clones are tangible?! Shadow clones?!
 If so… Kagero!
 Understood…
 Come out!
 Borne to be born, lived to live, one sunrise and one sunset…
 The life of a mayfly lasts but one day.
 Thinking that such a fleeting life is pitiable is, in fact, pitiable…
 Know that I’m at my best
 when living in the dark and deep in the ground!
 Ninja Art:
 Ant Lion Jutsu!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Darn it! What a pesky bunch!
 But I won’t be done in so easily!
 I have to kick that Orochimaru jerk’s butt
 and bring back Sasuke and Sasame’s cousin!
 It doesn’t matter if you guys are powerhouses!
 I’ll kick all of your butts, so bring it on from anywhere!

60,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 I’ll give it to you straight…
 Your next mission was commissioned by a certain Feudal Lord’s daughter.
 You are to act as her double.
 I don’t know where she heard about you,
 but you apparently bear a striking resemblance to the princess.
 Therefore she requested that you be the one who carries it out…
 A double…?
 Is someone targeting the princess?
 Well, if anything, she’s the one who’s doing the targeting…
 Huh?
 Not to worry.
 You’re already an admirable Hidden Leaf Shinobi.
 Furthermore, I’ve arranged for you to have an assistant.
 Assistant?
 Grandma Tsunade! You have a mission for me?
 And one from a Feudal Lord to boot!
 Huh?! 					Lady Tsunade!
 Sorry, but all the other guys are too busy.
 Just me and this guy?
 Yup. Do your best to carry out the mission.
 The client is a Feudal Lord’s daughter, huh…
 Wow… I guess that means that I’ve finally became good enough
 to handle amazing missions like this, huh?!
 Hey, don’t get too excited.
 Terrible things happen when you're like that.
 I know… Just leave things in my capable hands!
 You’re really a piece of work…
 Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!
 Thank you for coming from afar.
 That’s the client?
 She and Ino really do look alike, but…
 I-It’s a bit of a stretch…
 It’s all right. I have an idea of what you wish to say.
 My physique doesn’t really resemble that of the double there…
 That’s what you’re thinking, right?
 – Oh…not at all… Umm… – To be honest,
 – I don’t think you resemble her at all. – Hey!
 Well, I don’t blame you for thinking that. But here, have a look at this!
 T-That’s…lno!
 That’s what I looked like a short time ago…
 Truth be told, I only got like this
 after it was decided that I was to have an arranged courtship.
 An arranged courtship?!
 The other party is Master Chikara from the neighboring Land of Udon.
 Ever since I saw his picture,
 my feelings for him have deepened day by day.
 And as the day of the arranged courtship grows closer,
 I have become increasingly nervous, my cheeks have been flushed,
 and my heart has been pounding.
 I can’t even sleep at night.
 And because of that stress, I’ve started overeating…
 It goes without saying that you’ll get fat if you pig out.
 Of course, I’ve taken appropriate countermeasures!
 I’ve been using something that cuts all the fats and carbohydrates that I ingest…
 ""Easy-Peasy Slim Special”
 It didn’t work, did it?
 I placed too strong hopes in it…
 How can I possibly have an arranged courtship
 with the man I’m infatuated with when I look like this?
 So that’s my situation… Now, let’s get to the main issue.
 I want you to attend the arranged courtship in my place
 and make it a success at any cost.
 Huh?! 					So this double thing
 is just to act on you behalf at some arranged courtship?!
 What do you mean by “some arranged courtship”?!
 I mean, when you talk about doubles, you thinks of situations
 where someone’s life is in danger and that sort of thing.
 What are you talking about?!
 The princess’s entire life is at stake! This is major!
 Oh! So you understand a heart in love…
 I sure do… A girl always wants to look cute
 for the guy she loves.
 Even if she’s a fake…?
 It can’t be helped. I mean, guys prefer slender girls.
 That’s exactly right!
 I’m counting on you.
 Sure thing! Leave it to me!
 But even if the arranged courtship goes well…
 The gap is just too big.
 I’ll just have to lose weight by the day of the wedding.
 I already have a plan in place for that.
 This supplemental type diet food, “Supplement Slender”!
 If I supplement all three meals with this…
 Why don’t you draw on the lessons you’re supposed to have learned…?
 In any case, I’ll use my charms to make this arranged courtship a success!
 This annex is where I often played in my childhood.
 I plan to use this to listen in on the arranged courtship from here.
 Huh… That’s pretty convenient.
 I would love to meet him in person if I could, but…
 Hey, is he that cool looking?
 Of course he is!
 He’s someone with something really special about him!
 Well then, just make sure he falls for you.
 Leave it to me!
 I thought you weren’t motivated…
 Well, this is a mission after all.
 So I think I’ll pull myself together and hustle!
 Don’t do anything unnecessary, okay!
 W-What’s up?
 The sound is getting closer!
 – What? 					– It’s so bright!
 There are many a handsome man in this world,
 but this man is renowned even among them!
 This man makes Land of Udon what it is…
 that sexy man with glistening sidelong glances!
 The oh-so-great young prince Chikara…
 Kneel down and bow before him!
 Sorry.
 It appears that I have kept you waiting, princess
 You're…Master Chikara?
 He’s even more intense than lntense-Brow Sensei.
 I’m sorry, pretty girl.
 I have constitutional low blood pressure.
 Dunno. He looks more like he has high blood pressure to me…
 What?
 D-Do you always scatter flower petals?
 Flowers are wonderful.
 They truly allay the fatigue of your mind and your body.
 Don’t you find them relaxing?
 I-I guess…
 Okay then, next…
 Hey, don’t you think he’s different from her description…?
 I mean, he’s fa…
 Fa…?!
 Stop!
 These sweets are really fabulous, aren't they?
 Do excuse us a little.
 What the heck are you doing, out of the blue like that?!
 It’s women’s intuition.
 I got the same vibe from him as Choji.
 That word is probably taboo.
 Oh, I see!
 Gimme a break!
 What’s up with that uselessly intense chubby guy showing up
 when she told us he’d be a handsome prince?!
 But wouldn’t his physique be a perfect match for her?
 I’m sure there must be some mistake.
 There’s no way a girl would fall in love with a guy like that.
 But maybe that’s the princess’ taste in men…
 That’s impossible. I mean…
 He’s flashy…!
 Intense…!
 And a fatso!
 He’s a freak! A freak!
 There’s gotta be a mistake! I’m sure of it!
 Y-You think so?
 What are you saying?
 There’s no mistake that that’s Master Chikara, the man of my heart.
 I thought so…
 What an elegant man…
 I deeply regret that I cannot see him up close with my very own eyes.
 I guess one could say that everybody has their own set of woes.
 Listen, make sure that he takes a liking to me no matter what!
 Stop complaining and get the ball rolling with dogged persistence!
 I will convey that to her.
 Has you tension not eased? Music is good for relaxation.
 Please, you need not go to the trouble…
 – What did she say? – She said there’s no mistake.
 She wants you to bulldoze on ahead!
 I can’t believe it!
 It’s our mission, you know!
 I know that…
 Princess Fuku…do you like roses?
 Yes…very much so…
 Great! 					I love roses too!
 In the language of flowers, they signify love!
 But don't their meanings differ depending on their color?
 For example, yellow roses are supposed to mean “Let’s break up”…
 It’s nonsense to discriminate because of color…
 I mean the flowers are not at fault, after all.
 For you.
 Hey…wait!
 Huh?
 I can’t do it! I can’t do it!
 There’s no way! He’s too intense.
 There’s no way I can act as a substitute for the princess!
 Calm down. Stop saying that and do your best.
 Nope. I just can’t stand him physically.
 Oh, I got it.
 If you just think of him
 – as a somewhat intense Choji… – Choji has fat on him
 for the sake of his Ninjutsu…
 I don’t have the slightest idea what purpose that prince’s fat serves.
 That’s a pretty severe opinion, you know…
 I’m going off somewhere for a moment.
 Huh? Hey, where are you going?!
 Gimme a break, that girl’s a handful…
 Well, this is for the sake of a mission after all.
 I guess it’s about time for Naruto to lend a helping hand!
 What is it?!
 I’m not judging you, but I think you should pass on that young prince.
 There’s something wrong with his head. I’m positive!
 What are you saying? He’s a passionate and wonderful man!
 But…
 I hired the Leaf to provide me with substitute for
 the arranged courtship and bring it to success.
 You’re a professional Shinobi, right?
 So I suggest you get on it and get the job done!
 The atmosphere in there hasn’t been very congenial at all!
 You need to be aggressive in making yourself appealing to him!
 I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Chikara!
 That’s right! Just like that…huh?
 That jerk…!
 H-Hey!
 P-P-Princess?
 Master Chikara… Could you loosen my sash for me, please?
 But…but…
 Please.
 Oh my gosh!
 There’s a creepy-crawler up here under the roof that looks like a sow bug!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 A creepy-crawler that looks like a sow bug?
 An insect?
 Oh…she vanished…
 What the heck are you thinking?!
 Where is the princess?
 I don’t know.
 She vanished…
 What is going on anyway?
 This is starting to irritate me… I can’t get what’s happening from here.
 Why are you meddling! I was just one step away!
 What do you think you’re doing, dressed up like Princess Fuku?!
 I’m telling you!
 In one of Pervy Sage’s books happened to glance at,
 this is the kind of thing that worked.
 I don’t believe that anyone would use such a garish advance!
 That’s dirty!
 There’s absolutely no way a type of guy like you
 would ever be mistaken for the protagonist of a boy’s comic!
 Huh! I was doing a way better job than you were!
 Gimme a break…
 Now that things have come to this,
 I need to take care of business before another meddler gets in the way!
 Huh… You gotta be kidding…
 It looks like my help is needed if this mission is going to be a success.
 Princess… where in the world have you been?
 Please forgive me. I was so nervous I just flew into a panic earlier on…
 You really seemed like a totally different person.
 I’m so sorry.
 You were such a wonderful person, that it became almost unbearable…
 Non. That is bad.
 We must change the air in here then.
 Oh, in that case, I will…
 Hi… Chikara!
 Huh?
 That just now, outside the sliding paper door…
 What’s the matter?
 There was one more…princess!
 That can’t be… Impossible.
 INNER INO 							Naruto…!
 But I’m very moved that you have such deep feelings for me
 that you actually saw a vision…
 Vision? No, I definitely saw…
 You mustn’t look!
 P-Princess?
 Damn…I did that without thinking…
 Oh goodness me…
 In my ardent desire for you to look just at me, I…
 What intense passion…
 All right… As you wish, princess.
 – Huh? 					– Allow me to catch
 those hot feelings in fine style!
 Could this be…?
 Come, don’t hold back.
 Huh?!
 You may not kiss him! No kisses!
 Oh!
 Goodness, you cannot be too careful these days!
 Who told you that you could go as far as kissing him?!
 Oh, it’s not that I wanted to…
 I’d have to say that you actually came to my rescue.
 Don’t bandy words with me!
 Listen carefully, holding hands is as much as I can concede to you…!
 You’re too loud!
 The princess vanished again.
 – Princess! 					– Princess!
 This isn’t good! I better hurry back.
 Don’t try anything funny in there!
 I know that! In any case, we can’t let him see the two of us together!
 Hurry back to your room, Princess!
 All right.
 Gimme a break that Ino…
 Dumping me in the lake like that. Thanks to her I’m freezing!
 This is bad! I gotta pee… Gotta go!
 I don’t know where the toilet is around here.
 There’s nobody around… Well, it is an emergency situation after all.
 Huh?!
 W-W-What the heck do you think you’re doing over there looking like me?!
 No…this is…um…
 How shameless! Stop that immediately!
 I can’t stop it…
 Do you not understand that I’m telling you to stop!
 It’s impossible to stop so sudden!
 Hey!
 Wait up!
 I wasn’t quite emotionally prepared earlier on…
 However, the feelings I have for you in my heart are true.
 Princess…
 Master Chikara…
 I have harbored a secret love for you for a long time.
 Please, take me…
 Huh?
 – I wonder what that sound is? – I have no idea…
 Rain?
 What a beautiful rainbow…
 Stop, I say!
 I told you, it’s impossible!
 Ouch!
 Princess?!
 Naruto!
 You idiot!
 Forgive me for this one, please!
 I won’t forgive you!
 Look what you’ve done!
 Ouch… Stop!
 What in the world is going on?!
 Oh no!… 					Umm…this is, well…
 All right, that’s enough… We can't fake it any longer.
 I apologize for having hoodwinked you. I am…the bona fide Fuku.
 You mean to say that the princess up to now was an imposter?
 That is correct.
 What is the meaning of all this?
 I wouldn’t have imagined that things would come to such a finale!
 No, that’s not correct, Master Chikara!
 Out of my way!
 The super body I fantasized about in my dreams! My ideal personified!
 Bravo!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 My cute princess. Please marry me!
 I’m delighted, Master Chikara!
 Hail the future wife!
 What is this anyway…?
 Somehow it seems like our mission turned out to be success in the end…
 I think?
 Could it be? I put all my efforts in making advances on a guy
 who’s not my type in the least and got rejected.
 Moreover, it was a totally wasted effort…
 Is that what happened?
 But, everything turned out well. So isn’t it okay?
 And both of them look so happy together…
 That’s not the problem! A damsel’s heart has been wounded…
 I can’t believe that, of all things, I was brushed off by a guy like that…
 He didn’t even glance in your direction at the end there.
 Stop it! Don’t remind me.
 You can never knows what a person likes, can you?
 Nope… there’s no way I’ll acknowledge that!
 A man’s got to like a slender girl better!
 In order to become even more of a woman,
 I’m going on a diet! On a diet!
 Wait…wait up!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Naruto, let’s make some bittersweet memories of youth together!
 – Huh? 					– No need to be shy.
 I am ready both in mind and body!
 What are you blabbing about all of a sudden?!
 It was long…
 To think how much I’ve waited for this moment!
 I have no idea what you’re talking about!
 Here I come Naruto! Please become my first.
 Just a minute.
 Next Time: “Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is all about Passion!”

61,"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.
 Yes, precious things are never in shape
 You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
 Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
 Even if you get lost, let's start walking
 One more time
 Hey! Geez.
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Weren’t you going to watch my training?!
 I’m researching now.
 Do it yourself!
 All right, then I’ll summon a frog, a frog so big you’ll be shocked!
 The Summoning Jutsu!
 Hmm? What’s wrong? Did a frog appear?
 W-Wait a minute!
 What part of that’s a frog?!
 If you don’t get serious, I won’t help you!
 Shut up! I am being serious!
 Then somehow find your Chakra as if your life depended on it!
 That’s what I’m doing!
 Huh?!
 Sasuke…
 Hey Sakura!
 Huh?!
 Sakura! It’s about time you wake and help me over here!
 I’m not sleeping! I’m busy right now!
 Yes, yes… Then when won’t you be busy?
 Later!
 I can’t believe it… Geez!
 A Feeling of Yearning, A Flower Full of Hope
 Some of you have probably already heard but…
 Gekko Hayate’s corpse was found near Kikyo Castle…
 What… Hayate?
 No way…
 That’s ridiculous!
 Is the opponent Orochimaru?
 No…we shouldn’t jump to that conclusion so easily.
 The one Hayate was following was likely a Sound spy called Kabuto…
 Well, it’s certain that Orochimaru is trying to do something but…
 So…we’ll cancel Chunin Exam and go after Orochimaru…?!
 No, he revealed his identity to Anko…
 sending us a threat not to cancel.
 Not to cancel the Chunin Exam
 for which all of the Ninja of the Alliance have gathered!
 What does it mean?
 Orochimaru possesses enough power to take down a small Land on his own.
 He’s a Ninja that probably every land has eyes on.
 Moreover, he conveniently holds a grudge
 against this Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Any Land would desire him.
 So could it be…
 that any Land in the Alliance would unite with Orochimaru
 and betray the Village Hidden in the Leaves?!
 Well, the Alliance Treaty is at the same level as a verbal agreement!
 As was in the former Great Ninja War…
 In any case,
 there’s too little information right now.
 Let’s end these unnecessary suspicions.
 We’ve already dispatched Anbu,
 the black ops to each Land to collect information.
 It’s dangerous to act carelessly…
 That could be what the enemy is aiming for.
 And also…
 I trust all of you!
 When the time comes,
 we’ll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf Village together and simply fight!
 At that time…
 Be quiet about this bruise!
 Should I have stopped him forcefully…?
 No visitors…?
 That’s correct. I’m sorry but…
 I know he’s been hospitalized, but no visitors…?!
 What’s going on?
 We’re also not aware of the details so…
 There’s no use worrying about it here.
 Huh?
 Should I bring get-well flowers?
 So pretty.
 Oh no!
 Oh… How unusual for you to come by to buy our flowers.
 N-Not really! Why would you care?
 Besides, isn’t it unusual that you’re minding the shop?
 I’ll choose quickly.
 People don’t like flowers with roots when they’re in the hospital
 since they don’t want to be “rooted” in the hospital…
 So cut flowers are fundamental.
 W-What are you talking about…?
 Playing dumb won’t work.
 You’re going to see Sasuke, right?
 Mom! I’m going out for a bit!
 I-Ino?!
 I won’t let you be the first to visit! I’m going with you!
 A get-well visit!
 Shucks… Ino pig!
 I’m taking this flower…
 One “rose” of love!
 That’s so cliché…
 Then I’ll make mine this. “Narcissus”!
 A noble flower that doesn’t succumb to the cold of the winter,
 but hopes for the spring and waits with dignified presence…
 with the wish for release from the hospital as soon as possible.
 You’ve gotten pretty knowledgeable.
 I told you I wouldn’t lose to you!
 Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?
 Uh… I need two.
 Why? One is fine.
 No… One for Lee too.
 More please!
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?
 Ten orders of kalbi!
 You sure can eat. Just watching you makes me feel ill.
 Here you are!
 It’s here!
 This is mine, all right? Don’t eat any of it, Shikamaru!
 I won’t eat any!
 What’s going on with you guys, barbecue in the middle of the day?
 – Oh…? 					– Huh?
 Ino and Sakura…
 Shikamaru, shouldn’t you be going through some special training or something
 to prepare for the final exam?
 I am…
 Every single day…
 Asuma is so persistent.
 Actually, Choji’s been joining us in the special training.
 Really?
 So you took it on?
 Yup! In exchange, he’s treating me to as much barbecue as I can eat!
 I see…
 Oh, I shouldn’t have held on for the Final Round.
 Don’t be ridiculous!
 There are numerous people who want to participate, but can’t!
 That’s right!
 From what I’ve heard,
 they’re doing some awfully difficult things
 over at Guy and Kurenai’s team!
 W-What’s that?
 Even though we’ve made it this far,
 to get totally thrashed wouldn’t be very cool…
 Aw man, what a drag…
 Whatever the circumstances,
 we’ve exceeded a human being’s limits.
 So I’ve used too much Chakra…
 Neji, are you all right?!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What?! A tadpole again?!
 You haven’t made any progress whatsoever!
 See how it’s bigger than the ones earlier?!
 How the heck should I know?!
 So you want to see Sasuke Uchiha…?
 Just five minutes.
 I can’t allow you to visit any longer than that.
 His body still needs to rest…
 Yes…
 Sasuke. You have visitors…
 Two cute young ladies…
 Oh…!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sasuke, Sasuke?
 His clothes are gone!
 – What?! 					– What?
 It’s terrible! He’s in no condition to be walking outside yet!
 Doctor! Doctor!
 Sasuke…
 No way…
 Sasuke will, without a doubt, desire me…
 Sasuke… Where in the world have you gone…?
 Could cliff-climbing be so taxing…?
 Damn, my body is sluggish…
 Will I make it in time…?
 Open!
 Huh?
 Yo!
 Huh… You finally made it here…
 We’ll search for Sasuke on our end.
 But if you happen to see him, please contact us.
 – We will. 					– Yes.
 And also…you wanted to see Lee, right?
 – Yes. 					– Yes.
 He’s also in no condition to move, so please make your visit brief.
 Lee, you have visitors.
 Two cute young ladies…
 Oh?!
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?!
 Really… even Lee!
 Lee! Lee!
 Lee…
 Huh?
 Look!
 Huh?
 Lee…?!
 Sakura, let’s go!
 Okay!
 200 one-armed pushups…
 If I can’t do them, 100 one-legged squats…
 190…!
 Lee! Stop it! 					Lee! Stop it!
 191…
 Lee!
 Please don’t touch me!
 Don’t…interfere… with my training…
 I need two…
 Why? One is fine.
 No… One for Lee too…
 Speaking of which, Sakura, did you hear about that Lee?
 What? Hear what?
 Well, that Lee…
 his injuries were serious and he can no longer…
 continue as a Shinobi.
 195…
 196…
 197…
 198…
 I’m…not finished…yet!
 There’s no value in making an effort for someone
 who doesn’t believe in himself!
 One…one hundred…ninety…nine…
 One… One more…
 One more time…!
 – Huh?! 					– Oh!
 Lee…!
 I’ll…go get the stretcher.
 Please keep an eye on him.
 Yes.
 Hey…lno…
 Huh?
 Why do boys… have to push themselves?
 Don’t ask me that. I’m a girl you know!
 Sorry…
 The Human…Boulder!
 Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Ju…!
 Darn it, I don’t have enough Chakra!
 What’s the matter, Shikamaru?!
 Have you hit your limit already?
 Man! What a drag…
 All right, Choji! One more time!
 Who brought that…?
 The rose I went to the trouble of bringing was a waste.
 My narcissus too…
 Oh… How boring.
 Hey, Naruto!
 The swimsuit gals have gone, so why don’t we call it a day?
 What? Let’s stay a little longer!
 Come on, a little longer… Just a little longer!
 I’m hungry. And I’m pretty tired too.
 You haven’t even done anything.
 You should be thankful I hung out with you!
 He’s getting ticked off at me.
 All right, I got it… Sexy Jutsu!
 Oh!
 What, that’s it?
 What I want to do isn’t the Sexy Jutsu, but Summoning Jutsu!
 All right, all right… Then try it out.
 Here goes--!
 Summoning…Jutsu!
 I did it!
 You should die! You have no talent!
 Take a careful look!
 Huh?
 See, it has rear legs!
 You idiot! Conjure one up with hands, feet and ears!
 Shut your mouth! Having legs is better than before!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Ichiraku's ramen is as good as usual!
 If the training continues like this, I don't mind doing it forever!
 Eat, keeping eating more because this will be the last…
 What? Did you say something?
 Do you like the food?
 Hey master, one more bowl of ramen please!
 Good. Just keep eating away so you'll have no regrets about your life.
 Next time, ""Live or Die: Risk it All to Win it All!""
 Is this sage hiding something from me?

 My body movements have finally returned…
 Blood…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fighting with Old Lady Tsunade?!
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
 That man is Orochimaru…
 Shizune, you take care of the guy with the glasses…
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru.
 Before that, I’d like to have Tsunade do something about this body.
 The effects of that drug might still last for awhile…
 There’s nothing that I can do about it.
 What? Really?
 Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.
 I have no choice but to fight in this condition.
 Tsunade… Rest your body with Recovery Ninjutsu.
 Then… What about me, me?
 You guard Tsunade together with that pig.
 What?! I want to fight, too. Even I can--
 No, you won’t!
 Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
 You’re on a different level.
 The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
 and the man who killed the Third Hokage.
 An eye for an eye… I’m the only one who can fight him.
 And that four-eyed guy possesses the same level of power as Kakashi.
 Okay.
 Then… Shadow Clo--
 Hold it!
 Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu. lt’d be utterly pointless.
 What?
 It wouldn’t even become much of a diversion…
 It’d be a waste of Chakra…
 with them as opponents.
 Now then, let’s get this thing started.
 – Summoning Jutsu. – Summoning Jutsu.
 Hi.
 – Huh?! 					– What is this?!
 – Wha--?! – What the heck’s going on?!
 Long time no see.
 On account of the drug,
 Master Jiraiya still can’t build up Chakra very well.
 It looks like your stupid still hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.
 That’s too much even for you with no ability.
 It seems Tsunade got you with something.
 A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
 so perhaps she was thinking ahead and drugged him
 with something that would contain his power.
 To think she’d make a sacrifice of Jiraiya…
 Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
 To think I’d already have my handicap spotted.
 You are such a disgraceful guy as always…
 Dang it. It kind of ticks me off when the Pervy Sage is mocked.
 Summoning…Jutsu!
 The Nine-Tailed Fox kid from the Chunin Exam.
 I wonder if I should’ve killed him then, after all.
 For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
 I acknowledged his achievement… and let him slide by.
 But the only ones who can break a Five-Pronged Spell
 are the Sannin members and the Third Hokage.
 Which means Jiraiya may have already taught it to Naruto.
 Perhaps.
 If he’s able to control the Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 Oh…
 Th-This is…
 It doesn’t quite look to be so.
 He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability to begin with, so…
 Why?
 He’s still got a long way to go, sure enough.
 Why?!
 Hello.
 Hey, Gamatatsu. Why did you come out?
 Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
 It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.
 I-I wonder if I can do my best?
 Idiot. Get some snacks or something and hide.
 What? I can get snacks? Goody-goody.
 Here I go.
 I’ll take Jiraiya.
 I leave the rest to you.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya, one of the Sannin.
 Naruto!
 Your opponent is me.
 Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
 Dang it. I can’t completely sink them with such a puny swamp.
 The drug is still working.
 But…with this, the snakes can’t move.
 Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
 I’ll be up a creek if I take even one breath.
 My leg tendons…!
 I won’t be eaten twice…! No way!
 Here I go.
 Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
 Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.
 Even if we both have handicaps, you won’t one-up me…
 Give up now.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I had respected you as a fellow Medical Ninja.
 Stop. Stay back!
 Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…
 The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru is also called, will cry.
 My body’s heavy.
 To think you who were once called the village madness
 would ferry around such a kid and struggle tirelessly for the village.
 You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?
 I have a keen eye to discern ability.
 And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.
 It’s precisely for this reason… that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.
 It’s no fun raising a genius who’s good from the start.
 So you can’t leave him alone
 because it’s like you’re looking at your old self?
 That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
 And that’s because Naruto doesn’t possess the Sharingan.
 Shinobi ability is about whether
 one can use and master all the Jutsu of the world.
 Ninja refers to one who can use Ninjutsu.
 Shinobi ability is no such thing.
 You still don’t get it?
 A Ninja…is one who endures.
 It’s a difference of opinion, huh.
 I’ll teach you one thing.
 What’s most important for Shinobi ability…
 isn’t the number of Jutsu one possesses.
 What’s important is…
 The mettle…
 not to give up.
 Enough already…you jerk!
 The mettle to never give up…
 He possesses that.
 Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,
 but you can’t hit me with such a large motion.
 No good.
 It won’t easily hit with a moving opponent.
 Owwee!
 And the Chakra isn’t completely held, yet…
 It seems you got a cracked thigh bone in your left leg
 from the battle with the snake.
 Well, you can still move if it’s just the bone.
 But it’s impossible now…
 The lateral vastus muscle in your right leg is totally cut off.
 What should I do…?
 That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
 If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.
 Are you scared of me?
 Do you want to run away from here?
 Naruto, as I recall,
 you whooped it up like this during the first Chunin Exam.
 Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!
 ""Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away.""
 ""I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…""
 ""I’ll become the Hokage at any cost, so it’s okay with me.""
 ""I’m not scared.""
 Can you… whoop it up in the same way now?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name no matter what!
 – Hokage is my dream! – Hokage is my dream!
 You’re not a kid anymore, so you should stop whooping it up…
 Depending on the situation,
 when you want to give up and run away, you should run away.
 Oh my… What’s with that look?
 You’ll die! If you die, there are no dreams or anything…
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin, so you should run away on the battlefield.
 Don’t tell a man to run away.
 Kids think that everything is easy.
 That’s why they talk about foolish dreams like nothing at all.
 That’s why they can’t give up.
 Jiraiya, was it you who taught him that Rasengan?
 Are you acting like a teacher by teaching a Jutsu that can’t be learned?
 Don’t give him false hopes.
 That’s why a moony kid starts joking that he’ll become the Hokage!
 They chase after foolish dreams… and then die.
 If I have three days, I’ll master that Jutsu.
 Then let's make a bet.
 Bastard!
 As for me… I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 A bet?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you’ll be able to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 You should’ve just stayed out of this…
 Why?
 Why?!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 You’re still going to get up?
 Just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.
 Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto. Stop it!
 I told you that you’d die if you were obstinate like that, right?
 If you die, there will be no dreams, no nothing.
 Just get out of the way. Run away.
 Humph… It’s okay.
 I…
 I absolutely will not die…
 until I become the Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 It’s the same Chakra movement as before.
 No, this is…different.
 I see.
 In order to gain a hand for suppressing Chakra,
 the Shadow Clone…
 Compress Chakra and…
 hold it completely.
 Wha--?!
 I-It can’t be.
 Rasengan!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 I never forget my ideal…
 to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf and protect its people.
 The Hokages have sacrificed their lives for that dream.
 And now, I also will put my life on the line.
 From this moment, I am the Fifth Hokage!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists

 The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan
 No matter what darkness might lie ahead,
 I will rush into it headfirst!
 No matter what happens,
 I will get my hands on that power!
 It’s getting late…
 What was that?
 I thought I sensed someone there just now…
 The lights…
 It isn’t even close to bedtime yet…
 This is…!
 Wh-What is this…?!
 What the hell is this?!
 Uncle… Aunt…
 Father… Mother…
 Father? Mother?
 There’s somebody in there!
 Move!
 Move!
 Move!
 Father! Mother!
 Big Brother!
 Big Brother! Father and Mother are…!
 Why? For what reason?!
 Who the hell would do something like this…?!
 Big Brother…what are…?
 What are you doing, Big Brother?!
 You pathetic younger brother…
 Mangekyo Sharingan!
 Stop! Big Brother!
 Don’t make me see this kind of thing!
 Why…?!
 Big Brother, why did you…?!
 Why…
 Big Brother… Why did you…?
 In order to measure my vessel…
 To measure your vessel?
 Is that all?
 Only for that reason… you killed everybody…?
 That is what is important.
 What the hell is that?
 You gotta be kidding!
 I’m scared…
 I’m scared!
 Don’t kill me…!
 I don’t believe it!
 This is too unlike you, Big Brother. I mean…
 The reason I acted as the big brother you desired was…
 because I wanted to measure your vessel.
 You have the potential to become my opponent
 in order for me to measure my vessel.
 You hated me…
 and you continued to have the desire to surpass me.
 That’s exactly why I will allow you to live…
 for my own benefit.
 You are someone who could be able to use Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.
 However, on one condition…
 That you must kill your closest friend…
 Y-You’ve gotta be kidding…
 Just like I did…
 Regarding Shisui Uchiha who committed suicide last night
 by throwing himself into the Nakano River…
 The other one that did not show up to the meeting is Shisui…
 If I remember correctly…
 you adored him like he was your real older brother…
 That was…your doing…?
 Big Brother, you…killed Shisui?!
 That’s right…and because of that I obtained these eyes.
 The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
 Underneath the seventh tatami mat on the far right
 is the secret gathering place of the Clan.
 There you will find recorded the secret of…
 the raison d'être of the Uchiha Clan’s Visual Jutsu.
 The secret of the raison d'être…?
 If you attain these eyes,
 you will become the third person including myself
 to utilize the Mangekyo Sharingan.
 If that happens…
 then there will have been meaning in my allowing you to live.
 However…at present…
 You are not worth killing.
 My pathetic younger brother…
 If you want to kill me, then begrudge me!
 Hate me!
 And live in an ugly manner…
 Run away…run away… and cling to life…
 And one day, when you have the same eyes as I do…
 come and stand before me!
 A dream…?
 Yes…that’s right.
 The only one who survived… is that boy.
 Didn't he have an older brother?
 Yes, but he’s gone missing…
 It can’t be true… That elite Uchiha Clan…
 Hi, Sasuke! What did you come to buy today?
 Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
 Yeah.
 I saw Itachi earlier, but he’s very admirable, isn’t he?
 He’s already become a top-class Shinobi.
 He graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class at age seven
 and attained the rank of Chunin at age ten, didn’t he?
 He was able to use Sharingan when he was eight!
 That’s true, isn’t it?
 That boy is truly the pride of the Uchiha Clan.
 Welcome home…Sasuke!
 Sasuke…!
 Wait a second…
 What is it?
 Mother?!
 Then why only Big Brother!
 Your brother's your brother. And you are you.
 Father cares deeply about both of you.
 The main hall of Nakano Shrine…
 Located underneath the seventh tatami mat on the far right
 is our clan’s secret gathering place…
 I see… So that’s what it is…
 Ninja Academy
 Hey, Shikamaru…
 Wanna go to the candy shop after school?
 Huh… No way.
 You can do that ‘cuz your mother’s nice,
 but if my mother found out that I bought myself a snack before going home,
 I’d be in big trouble.
 Did you hear the news…
 that entire Uchiha Clan was apparently murdered?
 Yeah, my dad told me.
 Apparently he’s the only one who survived…
 That’s my boy.
 With me, you’re all your father talks about…
 I wonder…what kind of things Father was saying to Mother…
 If you want to kill me…
 Begrudge me! Hate me!
 If it’s for the purpose of killing you,
 I will rush headfirst into whatever darkness which may lie ahead!
 I will obtain that power no matter what!
 From this point onwards, I am an avenger!
 Sasuke is now in depths of darkness…
 If you stop in a place like this…
 you won’t be able to catch up with Sasuke.
 Neji, it’s just like you said.
 That guy looks like he’s in the depths of darkness right now…
 He really hit me with his full strength! Damn it!
 Don’t you consider me… your comrade any longer?!
 Don’t all those things we did together in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!
 No.
 I will get my hands on that power no matter what.
 It wasn’t meaningless…
 To me, you became my… closest friend.
 We've become…friends?
 Then…why?!
 All the more reason why…
 All the more reason why…
 there’s meaning in taking you down.
 I don’t fully understand but…
 I understood that you want to fight me with your everything!
 Sasuke…!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Are you trying to take me down for real?
 I don’t know any longer
 whether you really meant what you said earlier or not!
 Could it be that it was only I who thought we were friends?
 If that’s the case, I’m just a really lame guy…
 Aren’t I? Sasuke?

 Okay, pull him up!
 There, eh?!
 Damn! Was it a clone?!
 Over here!
 Counterattack, here it comes!
 Rasengan, go!
 What--?!
 You little…!
 Yes!
 Be careful, Naruto! There are two others hiding!
 Hey, there they are!
 Kagero!
 Let’s retreat for now!
 Hold it!
 Th-They’re totally quick at running away!
 Naruto, why’re you spacing out?!
 Where’s Sakura?
 Oh! Oh, no!
 Sakura!
 Oh! Naruto…
 Thank goodness! You’re okay, Sasame.
 Yes… Sasame’s okay.
 Sasame's totally okay.
 What’re you mad about?
 Let’s take a break here.
 Sakura…Who’s the cute girl?
 Okay! That’s close enough…
 What’s the deal…Sakura?
 Okay, don’t come any closer!
 Wh-What… I’m only interested in adult women!
 You must not misunderstand…!
 Don’t misunderstand!
 It’s not a misunderstanding.
 It seems Sakura’s finally figured out Pervy Sage’s true nature!
 I told you to stop calling me a “Pervy Sage”!
 Then you’re the Lewd Sage!
 Both of you stop it! Sasame’s scared!
 – Okay. 					– Okay.
 Jeez…
 This girl is Sasame…
 She’s a Ninja from the Land of Rice Paddies…
 A member of the Fuma Clan.
 She had her cousin taken away by Orochimaru
 and was looking for his hideout.
 Right. And the Ninja just now were after Sasame
 in order to protect the secret of the hideout!
 Oh…With the Fuma Clan, huh?
 Huh?! You know?
 I had contact with Ninja in the town who’d left the Fuma Clan.
 What! So you were actually doing some serious investigating, Pervy Sage?!
 I-I can’t believe it…!
 Well you see, when I went to this nice-looking bar,
 it just turned out to be their hideout.
 What! So after all, you were just hanging out with some girls, right?
 You mustn’t talk in a way that’ll lead to a misunderstanding!
 Even Sakura who respects me will…
 I’ve long since stopped respecting you!
 I…I see…
 Members of the Fuma Clan…?
 Yeah. The boss was called Hanzaki or something…
 Hanzaki and the others are traitors who abandoned the clan.
 Oh…
 Did those people do something?
 They were after my travel money, so I taught them a lesson.
 While at it, I attempted to ask them about Orochimaru’s hideout…
 but they didn’t know anything.
 I can show you the way to Orochimaru’s hideout.
 For real?!
 Yes…
 All right!
 Your wound hasn’t healed yet. Don’t push yourself.
 Yes…but…
 This is the entrance to the Village Hidden in Sound.
 Orochimaru’s hideout is deep in those mountains…
 I bet Sasuke is somewhere in those mountains…
 Okay, at last!
 Let’s hurry!
 Well, hold on…
 Why?!
 If we don’t hurry, night will fall before we arrive at Orochimaru’s hideout…
 That’s right!
 Sasuke is just a stone’s throw away! Pervy Sage!
 If we’re going to save him, we should do it as soon as possible!
 Why do we have to wait?!
 Huh…?
 What?
 Gee…
 Well…I’m hungry, you see…
 You know… All Shinobi must …
 I can’t fight if I’m hungry!
 Up ahead will become full-blown enemy territory.
 We won’t have time to have relaxed meals, so…
 Okay, you guys eat, too! Eat!
 Mm, this is good…
 You prepared this especially for us?
 No. It seems the prettiest girl in the bar fell to my charm, you see.
 She made these with tender loving care.
 I’ll go make some tea.
 Oh…thanks…
 Tastes pretty good.
 Tea is ready.
 Here you go!
 Here you go.
 Thanks…
 Here you go.
 Thank you, Sasame…
 Sasame, you should come here and eat with us, too.
 Okay…
 Pervy Sage…What’s wrong…?!
 Naruto…!
 Sasame did it…
 Since it’s come to this, they’re ours.
 Your wound still hasn’t healed.
 Kagero, you wait here.
 No mistake…They’re Leaf Ninja.
 If we take care of the Leaf pursuers…
 Lord Orochimaru will surely acknowledge the power of the Fuma Clan.
 Yeah…
 Let’s come back with good news.
 And with the heads of the Leaf Ninja as souvenirs!
 I finally found it!
 At first, I thought it was someone from the Hidden Leaf Village.
 But it’s Sasame, believe it or not…
 Kamikiri, Jigumo, Kagero…
 This is an odd reunion.
 Where’s Arashi?! He wasn’t with all you guys?!
 Arashi is serving near Lord Orochimaru and is spending his days training.
 Can I see Arashi?!
 If you’re also going to work together with us for Lord Orochimaru,
 I’m sure you’ll be able to see him.
 How’d it go?
 You’ve done well.
 With this, I’ll be able to see Arashi, right?
 After we’ve finished them off!
 Why?! Weren’t we just supposed to take them to Lord Orochimaru
 for examination after capturing them?!
 We only need the heads for the examination.
 No!
 These people… For my sake…!
 Move it!
 – Wha--?! 					– Huh?!
 What?!
 The Fuma numbing medicine didn’t work!
 We knew about it all along from the beginning!
 Sakura!
 Substitution…?!
 I leave Sasame to you!
 Leave her to me!
 Sasame… Hang in there!
 Why…? Why does Sasame have to do something like this?!
 No, it’s not that she’s doing it against her will…!
 It’s something she wanted to do!
 Liar!
 It’s true…
 What…
 What should I do to be able to see Arashi again?
 It’s not a difficult thing.
 You just have to put the lights out of those who infiltrated the Land of Rice Paddies.
 We have to kill them…?!
 We’ll take them back to Lord Orochimaru for examination.
 So we’re not going to kill, right?
 If we carry out that work, Lord Orochimaru will acknowledge us.
 Hanzaki says that Arashi and everyone are being tricked by Orochimaru.
 He says that you’ll just be used and thrown away…
 Hanzaki’s just a traitor who abandoned the village.
 Will you believe what we say?
 Or will you believe what a traitor says?
 Lord Orochimaru will surely restore our Fuma Clan…
 Sasame, although you’re still young, you’re also one of the Fuma.
 Assist in the restoration of our Fuma Clan…
 So you guys did trick Sasame!
 It’s all for the restoration of the Fuma Clan!
 You little!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Here I go!
 Wha--!
 U-zu-ma-ki…!
 Naruto Barrage!
 This is bad…!
 Rasengan!
 This is for Sasame. Prepare yourselves!
 Naruto!
 You’re…from before?!
 The Earth Style Jutsu user in question, huh?
 However, there’s no point to using that Art in this rocky area.
 Indeed, the Ant Lion appears from inside the ground
 and the spreading of its wings under the sunlight is
 but a momentary gleam.
 That’s when I die as Kagero!
 Be careful!
 What’s this…?
 Look! Naruto…
 Wha--?!
 U-Unbelievable!
 You were a woman…?!
 The clan will once again be in a place lit by the sunlight…
 Lord Orochimaru promised that…
 I’ll use this once-in-a-lifetime Art if it’s for the sake of that.
 Kagero's Ninja Art: Ephemera!
 Naruto! Come with me!
 Naruto!
 I-I feel like…I’ve seen this before…
 It’s Toad Mouth Trap Jutsu.
 I summoned the extraordinarily sturdy stomach of
 the Mount Myoboku’s lwajuku Giant Toad.
 Stomach…?
 Yikes!
 It’s melting…
 If I didn’t do this,
 we wouldn’t have been able to defend ourselves from her Chakra.
 I believed…that the clan would someday…
 I believed in that.
 Sh-She vanished.
 I’ve got to hand it to her.
 She probably put all of her life on the line
 and attempted to save her comrades…
 It’s unforgivable!
 Those guys… 					the Fuma Ninja…
 Their feelings toward the clan is the same as our feelings!
 Manipulating the Fuma’s desire to restore their clan…
 I’ll kick Orochimaru’s butt, no matter what!
 Wh-Where are we?
 Kagero…!
 You risked your life to save us?
 You idiot…
 Please…
 Please use your Medical Ninjutsu to save her.
 Our comrade doesn’t have long to live!
 Put your hands to your chests and think.
 Think about what you weren’t able to accomplish…okay?
 We risked our lives working for you… to help you, Lord Orochimaru.
 In order to restore the Fuma Clan!
 Please recognize our work!
 You’ll just have to atone for your failure with your bodies.
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I’m sorry for the betrayal!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 That’s Orochimaru’s residence!
 It really is just like him to construct his residence underground.
 Sasuke is somewhere inside that residence, right?
 Sakura, let’s hurry!
 Right!
 Be careful! First Avenue of hell is up ahead!
 Will a devil appear, or will a snake appear?
 Heh! I’m looking forward to it!
 I’ll kick the butts of the devil and the snake.
 And I’ll save Sasuke and Arashi!

 Sasuke is?
 There are no other signs of movement.
 But…
 Let’s not just stand around. Let’s go after Sasuke right away!
 But…what?

 We’ll end up taking a little longer way…
 but all there is for us to do is to avoid it.
 Why?! If we do that, it’ll only delay our catching up to Sasuke.
 Let’s just speed on through!
 What are you saying, Naruto?!
 We don’t know what’ll happen in the battle zone!
 Even if we don't desire it,
 there’s a possibility that we’ll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.

 That’s… Sasuke Uchiha! Did he get past Kankuro?!
 No… No matter how you look at it, it’s too soon.
 Did another assailant come?
 I don’t know what you Sand Ninja are scheming…
 but I’ll stop you!
 And…
 I’ll ascertain your true identity!
 Gaara!
 Don’t tell me…!
 Is he going to rouse that thing in a place like this?!
 This is no joke… lt’s out of my hands.
 Stop, Gaara! Have you forgotten the operation?!
 You who are strong… You who are called Uchiha…
 You who have friends…
 You who have a purpose…
 You who are like…me!

 I can truly experience “life.”

 It’s so obvious if you release such a blood-thirsty aura…
 Come on out.
 So it’s you, eh…
 What’s your purpose? Why do you seek power?
 It ‘s none of your business.
 Beat it! You’re a hindrance to my training.
 You…
 have the same eyes as I do.
 Eyes that seek power, brimming with hate and murderous intent.
 You’re like me.

 You’re naive.

 To think you’d make a clone out of insects and
 wrap around behind me…
 Not bad!
 Your reach encompasses from medium to long distance and you use a puppet.
 I didn't think you would do well in close combat.
 With that Puppet Master Jutsu where you have to concentrate
 on the control of the puppet…
 the one casting the Jutsu is prone to openings in defense.
 You’re very aware of the weakness of a puppet master!
 However, from here on,
 I’ll show you the essence of this Ninjutsu fighting style!

 This is Poison Smoke Bomb!

 You probably could’ve killed me if you’d been ten years younger.
 Sarutobi! If you don’t kill him now, the village is doomed!
 Do you understand?!
 I…understand!
 Useless…old man…
 Now…Let me feel it!
 That eye!
 That eye…from before!
 This doesn’t look like it’ll end by the time you come for back-up…
 Shino…
 It looks like the poison has slowly started to circulate.
 I’ll finish this!
 Insects, again?!
 But he shouldn’t be able to move so much in that state…
 I’ll make things easier for you…
 Hey! What’s wrong?!
 What’s happening…?
 Don’t tell me…!
 It’s futile… He can’t move anymore…
 I had the beetles burrow into every joint…
 He stuffed beetles into its joints so that the puppet can’t move?
 That was his aim from the beginning!
 The beetles are passing through the threads of my Chakra…
 Why…?
 That’s it! As I recall, their food is Chakra.
 At this rate, my location will be found out!
 He cut the Chakra threads himself…?
 You got careless!
 Instantly reattaching the Chakra threads that have once been cut
 is simple for a first-rate puppet master.
 And…
 Crow is a puppet…
 that has a weapon in each and every component of the body!
 It’s a big mistake if you think this has ended…
 by your stopping my movements!
 There’s lots of poison on the tip of the needle…
 Die!
 What?!
 Just like that, the insects…!
 The Chakra threads have been bitten through!
 What?! Why…?!
 Where did these insects spring out from?!
 By beating away the bait insects along the Chakra threads,
 you dropped your guard.
 You didn’t notice… the wriggling insects behind you.
 The insects were moving the whole time…
 heading for your headband.
 W-What did you say?!
 The one blow earlier…
 I pretended to miss and stuck one of those beetles on you.
 But how did you know where I was with one such beetle…?
 I…hate explaining the same thing twice.
 Shino? 					Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on you before you left the arena!
 The females have almost no smell…
 Only a male can sniff out the subtle smell of the female.
 Then, this one beetle on my forehead…
 Right… It’s a female.
 The poison has circulated through my whole body, huh…
 It looks like I won’t be able to go to back you up…
 I’m sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Is he a…monster?
 Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!
 Of my existence?!
 Come out… 					Sasuke Uchiha!
 You’re…my…
 prey!

 Huh? Uh… Excuse me…
 Return of the Morning Mist
 My mother and my father… They didn’t have to die.
 Because I didn’t have strength, the whole clan was destroyed.
 Everyone was killed…
 Darn it…
 Morning training is over!
 Once I’ve eaten breakfast
 I’ll get back to rigorous training!
 Old man…
 Konohamaru…
 Yo! Konohomaru.
 Naruto.
 Have you already resumed studies at the academy?
 N-No, not yet.
 The school buildings are damaged, so we’re all repairing them.
 Is that so?
 How about you, Naruto? You’re already training?
 Sort of.
 Wh-What?
 What is it?
 N-No, it’s nothing…
 – Hey um…! 					– Hey um…!
 So what is it…?
 You too, Naruto, what is it?
 Nothing…really…
 I don’t feel lonely.
 Huh?
 There’s no time to be feeling lonely.
 Everyone is working really hard to rebuild the village right now.
 Konohamaru…
 Right now, I must work for the village even just a little bit.
 So Naruto, you work hard at your training too.
 If you don’t, I’ll become Hokage before you.
 Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
 Besides…you have to graduate from the Academy first.
 Oh, that’s right…
 Oh, here it is.
 Here, it’s for you.
 A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku…
 Is it okay?
 I already have one, so I’m giving one to you.
 Thank you, Naruto.
 Oh! Konohamaru.
 Good morning.
 I’m going to go.
 We’ll work hard again today.
 – Yep! 					– Yep!
 Today we’re fixing the blackboards.
 I brought paint.
 Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku, I’ll continue training.
 This is it.
 Th-This is…
 A lot of time has passed since the death.
 It’s probably before the Chunin Exam began.
 I see, so that's it…
 That Orochimaru!
 After the murder of Lord Kazekage,
 Orochimaru… or someone like Kabuto played Kazekage…
 How thoughtless we were…
 That darn Sarutobi…
 Well, it’s not that easy.
 The one who was your opponent was the renowned Hokage,
 deemed to be strongest of all five great nations.
 However…you’ve done well. Two out of the five Kages…
 Stop…
 Stop giving me words of sympathy.
 I will kill you!
 Of course, I didn’t mean to…
 It’s true that we didn’t succeed in bringing the village down…
 On the other hand, another objective of this plan, Sasuke Uchiha…
 Your leash is now on him.
 In exchange for these arms and all of my Jutsu…
 If we could have gotten our hands on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
 it wouldn’t have been a problem.
 However that’s a dream that can no longer come true.
 He is stronger than I am.
 That is why…I pulled myself out from that organization…
 Kakashi, huh?
 What does he want?
 Breakfast, breakfast!
 Wait for me, my ramen.
 Do you already know his whereabouts?
 Yes.
 In that case, it will be easy…
 Let’s go.
 Here it comes, here it comes.
 Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought.
 Hidden Leaf Village… has a high average score.
 You’re still doing such a ridiculous thing?
 Well yes, this is my research.
 Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
 I wonder what you advisers want from me.
 Surely, you know…
 without our telling you, don’t you?
 You don’t have to make such scary faces.
 I heard that the talks with Sand Village have been settled without problems.
 The Hidden Village in the Sand announced that
 everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork.
 In addition, at the moment of their complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
 that wasn’t a very important issue any more.
 Leaf Village has no choice but to accept their surrender and proposition
 in order to restore national power.
 However, the current strength of Leaf Village has dropped drastically.
 Under these conditions,
 our top priority must be to prepare for any unpredicted crisis.
 We don’t know when any of the neighboring nations
 will come out in a bold move.
 Therefore, we’ve decided that until the village gets its strength back,
 we should assemble the top few men from each troop,
 and form an emergency executive committee to handle this.
 But first…
 we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
 You can find the seeds of trouble rolling around everywhere these days.
 It’s not just Orochimaru.
 You didn’t have to go through the trouble of informing me that.
 Well… I’ll continue gathering materials.
 I’m going to tell you the basic plan.
 We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
 And yesterday at an emergency meeting with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
 we decided it would be you, Jiraiya.
 I’m sorry, it’s not my nature.
 It has been decided.
 Besides, if a Shinobi like you, renowned as a Sannin, is not…
 then who is?
 If you want a Sannin, there is one more left…
 That Tsunade.
 Certainly that child probably has that capability, but…
 However, no one knows where she is.
 I’ll find and bring her back. lf I do that there’s no problem, right?
 But…
 A wise one like Tsunade is meant to be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.
 What do you want to do?
 All right. We’ll give it urgent consideration.
 However, we’ll have three members from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
 as the search unit for Tsunade.
 Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this. The guards are not necessary.
 However…
 There is one guy that I want to take with me on my trip.
 I’ve found an interesting egg…
 What? That is absolutely strange.
 Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket, there’s no ramen.
 No, wait a minute! I absolutely had one more.
 Huh?
 The one that I gave Konohamaru, was it the last?
 Welcome!
 Hey, my ramen!
 ""Racy Violence""
 Yo, you two!
 You seem to be getting along well.
 Fool, Anko asked me to buy rice dumplings. That’s all.
 What are you doing here?
 While I’m here to buy offerings, I’ve made plans to meet here…
 with Sasuke.
 Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people.
 Is the offering to Obito?
 Obito?
 Well…that’s about right.
 Kakashi, it’s strange for you to be here first.
 Well… once in a while.
 I don’t do natto (fermented beans) and sweet things.
 Oh… Is that so?
 What?!
 This is absolutely positively strange!
 You guys aren’t from the village… Why in the world did you come?
 I haven’t seen you for a while Asuma, Kurenai.
 If you know about us, are you former Leaf Shinobi?
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?!
 Y-You are?!
 Humph, without a doubt…
 Itachi…
 Uchiha.
 You are acquaintances of Itachi?
 If so…
 I’ll introduce myself as well.
 I’m Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
 Never mind later, I’m going to beat you now!
 Itachi…
 It seems you’re pretty unpopular in the village too.
 I know you, too.
 Kisame Hoshigake,
 originally a Shinobi of Hidden Village in the Mist.
 Suspected of national covert activities and of killing a feudal lord,
 a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water, on the wanted list in all nations.
 You’re a major S-rank criminal listed in the Bingo Book.
 Itachi, you have some nerve coming back to this village
 after causing that awful incident.
 Asuma… Kurenai…
 Don’t interfere with me.
 I don’t intend to kill you.
 That’s not a line for you, who killed your comrades.
 I know there’s no way you’d come here
 without any clear purpose in those suspicious appearance.
 What are you after?
 This guy is pretty annoying. Should we kill him?
 It doesn’t look like we are able to leave the village so smoothly…
 But don’t overdo it, your techniques tend to stand out.
 They're done for then.
 This is…
 Genjutsu.
 Pressing down with the tip of his sword… What strength.
 My large sword, Shark Skin…
 doesn’t cut, but lops it off!
 Kurenai… You’re late.
 With this…
 it’s over!
 Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me.
 This is…Genjutsu Reversal?
 Kurenai!
 There’s no time to look away.
 That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai.
 But…
 “But” this is as far as it goes…
 for you.
 What?!
 Water Style!
 – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 Well…I asked you to take care of them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 Shadow clones.
 Kakashi…
 Hatake.
 Cripes… So much fuss for nothing.
 I…
 I put it under my headband
 in order not to drop the important ticket during morning training.
 Okay, that’s fine… Eat well and do your best.
 Hmm?
 You’re going to do it again after this, right? Training?
 Of course! I’m full of motivation.
 Good! Here you go.
 Another serving for free! Go for it!
 Thank you, sir!
 Welcome.
 Just like I heard… I had to come and see it.
 It seems that you really are just eating ramen.
 Oh, Pervy Sage!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Itachi Uchiha…
 who became a leader of Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
 and who destroyed the Uchiha clan single-handedly.
 I don’t know why he has suddenly appeared after all this time…
 But I don’t think we will allow him to leave so easily.
 What is your purpose?!
 Next time: “Sharingan vs. Sharingan!”

 The rules are the same as in the preliminaries.
 The match goes on until one of you dies or admits defeat.
 When it’s determined that there’s a winner,
 the match can be stopped.
 But that’s my decision.
 Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
 Hey Guy! You too, Lee…
 Is your body all right?
 Kakashi!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Oh! Sorry, sorry.
 You must’ve been worried. Sorry for not contacting you at all…
 Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…
 I don’t really mind that.
 It's hard to see from here…
 Sasuke…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Hm?
 You know about the mark on Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?
 Is that…?
 No need to worry.
 A mark?
 So, that’s that.
 Yup!
 One…
 Two…
 Three…
 Four…
 Five…
 Six…
 Seven…
 Eight.
 Eight of them…
 There are eight members of Anbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…
 Two platoons are too few…
 What’s Lord Hokage thinking?
 Well…without knowing how or when the opponent would make their move…
 It can’t be helped that the Anbu are dispersed and deployed
 in important areas in the village.
 Huh?
 It’s about to begin.
 We shouldn’t let our guard down, but for now…
 We need to pay attention…  to this match.
 Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking out what sort of training you gave him…
 as your eternal rival!
 Huh? Did you say something?
 No! You’re slick, Kakashi!
 Why are you always so avant-garde?!
 Both of you, to the middle!
 Begin!
 So this is the sand Kakashi told me about…
 Please don’t get so mad…
 Mother…
 What’s he talking about…?
 Earlier… Earlier I had you suck awful-tasting blood.
 I’m sorry.
 But this time it’ll likely…
 taste good.
 His conversation’s started. This is dangerous.
 This is the first time I’ve seen Gaara get like that before fighting.
 So it must mean his opponent is that imposing…
 Him.
 It appears he’s calmed down.
 Come on.
 Hey…
 Do you remember… what he said yesterday?
 At that time…
 I will kill…you all without fail.
 Just wait.
 That’s what he said…
 But he didn’t do it.
 It was the perfect opportunity, but…
 he didn’t even see us.
 Now, let me feel it!
 We're…
 unsatisfactory for him.
 Right now, the only one who can make him feel anything…
 …is only Sasuke!
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myself…
 And if I see that all other people in this world
 exist only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 Naruto…
 Here we go!
 The Sand Shield became a Sand Clone!
 He’s fast! This guy… is just like that guy…
 He’s fast! It’s nearly the same as Lee’s ordinary speed.
 And…
 It's overlapping with the image…
 of my Taijutsu!
 Is that the Sand Armor?
 Come on!
 Thank you, Anbu man.
 So apparently, Hinata will be all right for now if she rests.
 Oh, is that right?
 Huh? You know this person? What‘re you taking about?
 This person is an Anbu…
 Not that, but at the examination…? What do you mean?
 Well, this is what it means…
 Come on!
 If you’re not gonna come at me, I’ll go at you!
 He’s fast!
 What’s the matter? Is that it?
 A-Amazing…
 That armor…I’ll tear it off.
 His speed is basically the same as Lee’s with the weights removed.
 It’s… It’s exactly like Lee’s Taijutsu.
 His speed is also completely different from before!
 Sasuke… You are indeed a genius beyond imagination.
 How many years did it take me to attain that speed…?
 And you attained it in a mere month…!
 However, it seems to consume a lot of stamina
 to continue that movement.
 What’s Gaara planning to do?
 The sand armor uses up too much Chakra…
 It can’t last for very long.
 What the heck sort of training did you do?!
 Hm?
 To get to that level in a mere month…
 Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsu with Sharingan.
 So during the Taijutsu training…
 I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.
 Sasuke could make that movement his own
 only because he knew Lee.
 Of course, Sasuke had to work very hard for it.
 But…with only that…
 With only Taijutsu… that Sand guy can’t be taken down!
 That Kakashi…
 He must have seen the battle
 between the hateful Gaara and the lovable Lee.
 Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
 can’t work against an opponent that even Lee couldn’t take down.
 He should have known this only to well.
 So if that’s the case…
 Why is it that he had Sasuke master only Taijutsu?!
 Why did I keep living?
 But as long as you’re alive, you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one, it’s just the same as being dead.
 What's this guy saying?!
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,
 finally, I became calm.
 Oh?
 Shikamaru…
 We need to go over to where Kakashi Sensei is right now!
 What’re you planning to do?
 Hey!
 I'm going to…
 stop this match!
 Gaara couldn’t possibly be planning to use that Jutsu!
 So he used all the sand for protection…
 I didn’t think there could be this much of a difference in the hardness
 with a difference in the density of the sand.
 So it’s absolute protection.
 The sand… lt’s covered his entire body.
 This is somewhat troublesome.
 Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto!
 Huh? What do you want?
 Sensei! Please stop this match right away!
 That guy is totally different from us!
 He’s not normal!
 Naruto… 					What’re you saying?
 He lives to kill people.
 In any case…
 If this continues, Sasuke will die!
 Jin, Saru,
 Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…
 There’s no mistake about it. lt’s that Jutsu!
 This isn’t good! Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.
 Shoot!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
 Even if one understands visually,
 it's meaninless unless one can move physically.
 I was filled with a sense of superiority.
 But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.
 Moreover, you have…Sharingan!
 Next time, “Late for the Show, But Ready to Go! 		The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!”
 I am really envious of you, Sasuke!

 This time for sure, the frog will…

 From which stage do you call it a frog?!

 That’s no surprise…
 For three weeks, he’s continued his training on guts alone…
 Lord Hokage.
 Anko, is it…?
 I’m sorry, I’m...
 Regretting returning alive from the Forest of Death?
 That’s a needless thing because you and Orochimaru have no connection at all.
 There is no Shinobi who can compete against that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.
 Even if I was the one to face him…
 If the Fourth Hokage were still alive…
 Don’t say that.
 He already saved this village and died…
 That’s a story from 13 years ago. He’s no longer here.
 We have to do something with our power.
 Yes.
 I’m going to get some fesh air…
 Don’t blame yourself.
 C’mon, open your eyes already.
 W-What’s that…?
 To be clear, you have no sense.
 Oh! Pervy Sage!
 After you’ve been training for 3 weeks, you are still this level.
 If you continue like this it’s pointless.
 That’s not how it is! I’m doing this with all my might!
 I understand that, if you really want to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,
 you have to do it like you’re going to die or it’s no good at all.
 That’s what I’m doing!
 I drill my Chakra every day like I’m going to die.
 If you have time to complain about it, teach me a trick or something!
 A trick, huh… A trick.
 What?! You’re going to teach me?
 You need to risk your life on it.
 L-Life…?
 It’s not a joke. Even so, will you do it?
 O-Of course! I always risk my life!
 I see…
 Huh…?
 Well then, follow me.
 What are we doing at a place like this?
 You’re not gonna peek again, are you?
 Well, that would be nice, but today it’s a bath.
 First, we purify our bodies…
 Huh?
 There’s something strange going on…
 This is such a nice bath.
 Like heaven… Truly heavenly…
 Hey, Pervy Sage.
 I’m Toad Sage.
 Whatever, but how are taking a bath and Summoning related?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
 What is it?!
 Hey, Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is there something you want to eat?
 I’m going to eat!
 It’s good! If the training is like this, I’ll do it every day!
 Eat up! Because this is the last…
 Huh?
 No, nothing. Anyway, eat! Eat a lot!
 Like there’s no looking back!
 I don’t know what’s going on, but I should eat, right? Okay!
 Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!
 Gotcha!
 One more!
 Coming right up!
 This time miso char siu!
 Yeah!
 I ate, I ate.
 Thank you, Pervy Sage…
 What?!
 Thanks for your patronage!
 I won’t even get blood from it…
 Yo, are you full?
 Don’t mess with me, Pervy Sage!
 Weren’t you treating me with the meal!
 Fool! Who said that I was treating you?!
 Aren’t you a grown-up?! Bastard!
 By the by, Naruto, isn’t there a girl that you like?
 Huh?
 I asked if you have a lovely girl?
 Well…you could say she’s there, you could say I like her…
 You could say it’s Sakura.
 So there is?
 It’s Sakura!
 Okay! Then go and hug that girl tight!
 What?!
 Is that a part of the training?
 Well, close enough.
 Okay! Right away…
 But if I do that, Sakura will…
 No! This is training too! I have to do it or I won’t be strong…
 But if I do that, Sakura will…
 For a while she won’t talk to me…
 No! If I’m going to master Summoning Jutsu,
 this can’t be helped!
 But…Sakura will…
 No! But…
 Hurry up and go!
 What do you want?
 No, uh…well…
 If it’s money you want, I won’t lend it to you.
 I may not look it, but I’m stingy with money.
 No, that’s not it…
 Well…
 Uh, if I tell her it’s for my training, she’s sure to beat me.
 If there’s nothing you want, then I ’ll go home.
 W-Wait a minute!
 Oh…
 This is it! This is my chance!
 Sakura! I’m sorry!
 Hey!
 What are you doing?!
 Cha!
 Ow… Ouch…
 This is a part of being young…
 Hey, if I do this I’ll really get a frog?
 Yes, that’s a definite.
 Really…?
 Is there anything you’ve left undone?
 Huh?
 None?
 What are you talking about…?
 To pull out enormous Chakra and use it.
 It is certain that it is difficult to have the control to do it…
 It is also certain that this body is a vessel too small
 to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…
 It’s likely that Naruto’s body normally tends to reject
 the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox in order to avoid too much strain.
 If the excitement of danger and emotion are the key
 to drawing out the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…
 he has to learn physically until he can automatically use that key.
 Nothing personal… Fourth Hokage!
 Huh? Where…is this…?
 Stand up!
 W-What’s going on?!
 Your training ends here.
 Huh? I haven’t done anything yet…!
 Naruto!
 Go die and come back.
 Die?
 From within the dreadfulness of death, squeeze out enormous Chakra!
 Experience it with your own body, and grasp the technique of it!
 If you don’t want to die, do something about it yourself… Got it?
 Now…we’ll see if the strength given to you is really yours.
 If I don’t grab onto this… I’ll die!
 Now!
 It’s impossible…
 This rock surface is slippery from the seepage of the waterfall.
 Besides, falling in that speed with the control of Chakra that you have,
 you can’t cling to the rock.
 Naruto, after this…
 you can only depend on the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
 Open up the key… This time from your side!
 If I go on like this! lf I go on like this! I’ll seriously die!
 Die!
 Die…
 Today, we’ll have a history lesson outside.
 As you know, this rock face has the faces of the Hokage line.
 In order from the left, they’re lined up fom the First,
 the Second… the Third…and the Fourth.
 So different from the present old man.
 Especially the receding hairline…
 Iruka Sensei! Who’s the Fifth?
 Hmm?
 Well, that hasn’t been decided yet…
 Perhaps it’s your teacher here!
 Hmm… Weaving an occasional joke to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?
 L-Lord Hokage!
 Oh, it’s the Third.
 Hey! Old man! What did you come to do?
 I wanted to see the rock faces too.
 You’ve come at a good time. Over this way, my lord.
 This is the real man of the third rock face!
 The Third Hokage!
 The third was called the strongest, a genius,
 called “professor” among past Hokage!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 Hey! Iruka, don’t say it in the past tense.
 S-Sorry.
 Are you really strong?
 Yeah, you don’t look it!
 Yep! That’s right!
 Enough!
 To take over the name of Hokage means you’re the strongest in this village!
 Okay! I’m going to become the Fifth Hokage!
 After all I’m really strong, and handsome too!
 It won’t work with the scores you have now!
 You’ve got a lot of confidence!
 You all are quite young, unlike me!
 There might be someone who will take the name of Hokage is in this group.
 You only have one life!
 Don’t choose an impossible road.
 It doesn’t matter if you live as you like and die as you like.
 However…
 no matter what route you take,
 remember to protect the people important to you!
 Important people?
 That you acknowledge… trust and love from your heart.
 Do you have people like that?
 Y-Yeah… Dad and Mom…
 and I hate him a little, but my big brother too.
 And… 					my dog Gonta…
 For me, it’s friends!
 Me too!
 Lord Hokage, you have people like that too?
 Yes, of course I do!
 Really! Who, who?
 I have my grandchild… Konohamaru over there and…
 All of the people in this village!
 Like you did too, once…
 Huh?!
 This feeling… It’s that Chakra…
 This is…
 Seal
 I-It’s huge… What is it?
 Hey kid, come closer!
 I want to eat and kill you, but this gate won’t open…
 Bloody spell that seals…
 You're…
 the Nine-Tailed Fox!
 I see… the red Chakra was this guy’s Chakra.
 For you to approach me…
 What business brought you here?
 Hey! You stupid fox!
 Since you’re staying in my body, as your rent, lend me your Chakra!
 After all, if you die I die.
 That’s some impressive courage for threatening me!
 That’s fine…
 As a reward for making it this far… I’ll give it to you!
 This is the feeling!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Well done.
 Where am I?!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Yay! This time for sure, I’ve finally brought out the real toad.
 Listen, you giant toad, I am your master from today!
 Huh? No, nothing.
 I will be your henchman, boss.
 I’m so happy…
 Next time, ""He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!""
 He’s seriously scary. I’ve never seen a toad like this one.

69,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 A Past to Be Erased
 That mark…
 I saw the same one on the guys  that attacked this village!
 That’s a lie!
 It’s not a lie! This mark…
 Same from that night…
 N-No! Spare me!
 Stop!
 This is the same mark from that time.
 No way!
 But this wasn’t in the medical team’s report.
 Byakugan!
 It seems this is a particular mark that only emerges
 when he sweats…
 You guys get out!
 Why?
 I’m going to take care of him.
 Say what?! I won’t let you do that!
 Why do you protect him? ls the Leaf Village also in cahoots?
 No, that’s not it!
 He doesn’t remember a thing from the past…
 He has no memory.
 No memory?
 It’s memory loss. We came in search of his memory.
 Then you should know now. He’s a dirty bandit!
 Whether or not he has a memory makes no difference to me!
 Calm down!
 It would only be in vain  to kill someone
 who has no memory of  committing a crime.
 Shut up!
 If you really want to have your revenge,
 do so as much as you like after getting his memory back…
 I won’t stop you at that time.
 I won’t let you do that even if he gets his memory back!
 It’s as Neji says.
 We’ll also find out the identity of the guys who attacked
 if his memory returns and we get him to talk.
 We might be able to save the village if we can use him to cut a deal…
 We have to keep him alive now. We won’t run away or hide!
 Keep quiet… He won’t let Menma live unless we tell him this.
 I’m going to sew up the wound. Hold his arms and legs.
 That girl is…
 I just can’t believe it. He’s the embodiment of good nature…
 To think he’d be a comrade of the bandits.
 I wonder if he became a good guy  after losing his memory.
 He just has the same mark as those guys due to some sort of circumstance.
 Even if he lost his memory,
 he wouldn’t become this good-natured of a guy if he was a bad person.
 Either way, we’ll know everything  if he get his memory back.
 I was…a comrade of the bandits, wasn’t I?
 You heard us talking earlier?
 Don’t worry about it. We don’t know any of the details. Okay?
 Heal that wound for now…
 I’m going to have a look around the area.
 You understand, right?
 Your friends and that guy will die  if you try anything funny.
 Do as you like when that happens.
 It’s done…
 Fuki…
 You heard, didn’t you?
 I can’t stand it, after all!
 Let’s get him. Let’s avenge everyone!
 Stop!
 It’s still not certain that Menma’s one of their comrades!
 You’re just as much to blame if you protect him!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 What’s the ruckus?!
 Naruto?
 Tenten…!
 Why did you let him out of the hut?!
 Sorry. I dozed off…
 I got careless thinking  he couldn’t move…
 Guys, stop! He has no memory!
 So he doesn’t even know if  he’s one of their comrades or not…!
 We warned you before!
 You guys are just as much to blame if you protect him any further!
 Get them!
 Stop it!
 We should get away for now!
 I’m…fine…
 What?
 Of course, everyone’s angry. I…should be punished.
 You’ll be killed!
 That’s fine!
 What’re you saying, Menma?!
 Byakugan!
 It’s them!
 The bridge! Raise the bridge!
 Right!
 Got it!
 Be careful of the Leaf Ninja and secure an entrance route!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Now’s our chance. Everyone hide!
 You, too!
 We can take care of this ourselves!
 Come on, Fuki!
 They’ve come from two spots!
 Where’d they go?!
 They vanished.
 Be quiet!
 The wind…
 I get it.
 They’ve trapped us  in a Genjutsu
 with a different tone mixed in with the sound of the wind!
 Be careful! We’re now inside their Jutsu!
 You noticed too late!
 M-My body…
 It’s heavy…
 This is bad… Is it Paralysis?!
 Canceling Sound!
 The Paralysis is released.
 You backstabber!
 Here they come!
 I’ll leave those guys to you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 It’s futile!
 Heh, what’s the matter? Finished already?!
 I don’t even have a scratch on me…
 This is what I was after!
 Wha--?!
 What’s happening? I’m getting an amazing power.
 Here I go!
 Rotation!
 Now, prepare yourself!
 You won’t get away!
 Here…
 This is precious to you, right?
 Behind you!
 You jerk!
 Your voice… It’s back!
 Th-Thank you…
 Now, let’s go back to the others.
 Right.
 Menma! You okay?
 Yeah…
 We took care of most of them!
 What about their leader? What about Shiin?!
 I chased after him,  but he got away…
 This is bad…
 Now that Shiin knows the villagers won’t abandon their homes and get out,
 he’ll use his last resort.
 There is a dam built upriver to secure water resources during a drought.
 There is enough water for the village  to last a year, even if it doesn’t rain.
 The dam has been rigged to blow up
 and to sweep away the entire village with a flood.
 All they care about is the mine.
 We can’t stop something like a flood
 unless we move mountains or something!
 Mountains…
 That’s it. We should move mountains!
 Naruto! Take me to the mine.
 Wha--?
 There should be a bunch of Letter Bombs in the mine!
 Letter Bombs?! What’re you going to do with those?!
 I’m going to blow up  the mine itself.
 The crumbled dirt and sand will  fill up the valley
 and the flood can be stopped.
 Damn it! He’s started! Let’s hurry, Menma!
 Naruto… There’s something  I have to tell you.
 Make it later!
 I haven’t lost my memory.
 Yeah… But stopping the flood comes first!
 No, I’d like you to listen now.
 I lost my parents when I was little and was raised in Shiin’s clan.
 They were a small Shinobi clan even in the Land of Rice Paddies.
 But they still had ambitious plans…
 However, a Shinobi village was created  in the Land of Rice Paddies
 about a year ago.
 It was the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 The Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Clan members confident in their skill
 drifted over to Hidden Sound Village  one after another.
 Eventually jobs from the feudal lord stopped coming.
 Shiin the leader of the clan that had lost its means of livelihood
 set his eyes on the mine in this village…
 The plan was to just threaten and chase off the villagers.
 But I encountered unexpected resistance,
 and I got scared and tried to escape…
 What’re you hesitating for?  Hurry up and take care of him.
 Father! Father!
 Stop it!
 You… You jerk!
 Look out!
 I’m a member of a clan that has committed crimes.
 It would’ve been better if I’d just died like that…
 How easy things would’ve been  if I could’ve died then…
 I got scared thinking about  the villagers who died…
 I wanted to forget.
 And so I cowardly escaped into a Jutsu passed down through the clan
 that erases memory.
 However, the Jutsu didn’t work  very well…
 I only temporarily lost my memory and it came back in a few hours.
 Then you had your memory  the whole time?!
 I’m sorry…
 Knock it off!
 Then why didn’t you tell me about that honestly from the start?!
 If you had, it would’ve been…
 I didn’t have the courage to make the crimes of the clan public.
 But I thought the clan must not commit any further crimes.
 So I pretended to lose my memory.
 And to prevent the clan from adding to their crimes…
 I wanted to bring some of you  Leaf Shinobi here
 and have you help out.
 I knew of Shiin’s next plan.
 There must not be any  more village casualties.
 Stopping that is my duty for having survived.
 Duty…?
 I needed the help of the Leaf Shinobi
 before Shiin could execute his next plan…
 I wanted to round them all up  during the attack earlier.
 But since things have come this far, I’ll stop the flood.
 Thanks, Naruto…
 I leave Shiin to you. Find and stop him, no matter what.
 You… This…?
 This is goodbye.
 Somebody has to blow up the Letter Bombs inside…
 If you do that, you’ll…!
 Thanks to you, my life has  taken on more meaning…
 What’s that sound?
 There are intermittent explosions occurring upriver…
 The village will be engulfed in a mudslide if the dam breaks!
 No…!
 Neji…
 It’s coming!
 Goodbye…
 Naruto…
 Menma!
 Wh-What happened…?
 It seems the crumbled mountain  stopped the mudslide…
 Then, that means the village is saved?
 Yeah…
 – Thank goodness! – That’s a relief…
 H-How can that be?!
 Menma!!
 That jerk…!
 He won’t get away! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hold it!
 Interfering with our plan!
 You think such a Jutsu will work  on me… Huh?!
 Die!
 I’ll stop you in Menma’s place!
 What?!
 Rasengan!
 He sacrificed his life to save  the village, huh…?
 No matter what his past was, he was a good guy at heart…
 Mister…
 I wanted to say a word of apology.
 Not being able to remember anything until the end
 might have been salvation for him…
 It was a promise, right? To eat this with you.
 You don’t need to say anything to him?
 He’ll be fine if he has an appetite. I know how he is.
 He’ll overcome it on his own as time passes.
 For a while he’ll probably remember each time he eats ramen…
 That’s fine.
 People can get stronger precisely because
 they have feelings that are never forgotten…
 That’s what’s called growth.
 Damn… This is good!
 Menma…
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands

 The Village Hidden in the Sand requested an auxiliary force?
 Ones who call themselves the Four Celestials
 took one of Sand Village’s Ninja  candidates as a hostage
 and escaped towards the Land of Fire.
 Presently, Gaara and others are chasing them.
 That means an ambush, doesn’t it?
 I will leave the strategy up to you.
 Take some Genin you can use and leave within half an hour.
 – That’s all. – Hold on please.
 What is it?
 Let me borrow Sakura.

 Heh… It seems you’re an ally this time…

 A Sand…

 Well, be careful going home.
 Okay.
 If something happens again, I’ll come to your rescue again…
 Just let me know, crybaby.
 You always say too much. That’s why girls are…
 I’ll return the favor twice the amount from that time.
 Hey, Shikamaru. What’s the matter?
 We’ll stand by here for a while.
 Stand by?
 We don’t have time fooling around in a place like this!
 Be quiet for a second, Naruto.
 That’s right. Shikamaru’s got a proper plan.
 Right, right.  Naruto, you have to be sure to obey the leader.
 Fine.
 Shino, I’m counting on you.

 Sand Alliance with the Leaf Shinobi
 So, Kujaku? What’s going on with our pursuers?
 Yeah, we went to the trouble of leaving footprints as we go.
 We need them to follow.
 It’ll be okay. They’ll be within firing range immediately!
 There are three pursuers. One of them is Gaara!
 As for the extra two, we'll leave one for each respectively
 and deal with them with One Shinobi, One Kill…
 I’ll isolate Gaara and drive him into the Reverse Scale Position.
 I’ll take the first person.
 All right, go.
 It's not necessary to drive him into the Reverse Scale Position.
 There are only three of them. I can handle them by myself.
 Flying Kujaku Double Edge Sword:
 Whirlwind!
 What?!
 What is this?
 A wind user, huh?
 Interesting!
 – Splendid. – Not bad, Temari.
 Naturally.
 Not half bad.
 To think you’d blow away my Whirlwind.
 What, you’re still just a kid?
 – You guys go on ahead. – What?
 Hey, Temari. You okay with this?
 Will you be okay?
 Well, we’re fellow wind users.
 I should be able to handle her alone.
 Hurry, Gaara.
 She’s your student, right?
 Thanks.
 – I’m counting on you. – Be careful.
 Right.
 You won’t get away.
 I’m your opponent.
 Cyclone Scythe Jutsu.
 Wind Slash.
 This wind is…
 These double swords alter the wind at my will to suit the attacks
 and amplify the power to the extreme.
 It’s too late to regret.
 I only need a little bit of Chakra as long as I have these swords.
 How long can you pesevere with the limited Chakra you have?
 How about testing that out?
 Matsuri.
 We caught up.
 Where are we?
 So you’re awake?
 Heh. You’re like prey plunged on a branch by a shrike.
 You’re the bait to lure him out.
 What?
 Gaara Sensei.
 Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 What?
 Darn it.
 Did you see that? This is the Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 You’re just a kid!
 I see.
 It’s an adjustable sword with daggers
 connected by an iron wire going through the center.
 Like a Bamboo Snake? How nostalgic.
 I used one a lot with puppet games when I was a kid.
 It can look like a living snake depending on how it’s controlled.
 But there’s no point once it’s been identified.
 Though we both use Puppets, compared to mine, it’s just a kid’s toy.
 Go, Gaara.
 Can I leave it to you?
 Yeah. I don’t need your help for this. I’ll catch up right away.
 I’m counting on you.
 Now, bring it on. I’ll play with you.
 What’re you doing acting tough?
 You’ll die if you take me lightly!
 That goes for you!
 Then die, Kabuki makeup jerk!
 Here I go.
 That’s no good.
 Come on, that was too easy.
 Too bad. This sword isn’t just an adjustable sword.
 The sword itself amplifies Chakra in response to my Chakra
 and changes into the form of a dragon.
 Gaara, I’m sorry. This might take a little time.
 Suiko, you ambush him here.
 Draw him into the Reverse Scale Position. Got it?
 Yeah…
 You won’t get through here.
 Gaara, fight me.
 Very well.
 Bring it.
 Hey, Shikamaru. How long are we going to stay like this?
 Shut up. There are many difficulties with ambushes.
 Right now, Shino, Neji and Hinata are taking on those difficulties for us.
 What? They are?
 Did you find them?
 Byakugan!
 In that direction, right?
 Byakugan!
 Got it. There are three battle areas.
 It’s the scent bag of the female Parasitic Insects.
 With this, the insects will find you no matter where you go.
 Right. I’m counting on you, Shino.
 Then, we’ll be going on ahead.
 Be careful!
 Oh, information has arrived.
 I was getting sick of waiting!
 All right, I’m counting on you guys.
 This is bad. lt’s already begun.
 All right, Kiba and Choji, you take the western forest.
 Ino and I will take the northeastern hills.
 Naruto and Lee, you take the northwestern forest.
 We’ll take on back-up in two-man cells.
 Now then, let’s begin the favor-returning operation.
 – Right. 					– Right.
 I was waiting for this time!
 Scatter.
 What is it?
 Hold up.
 If the guys who are fleeing will take on pursuers with One Shinobi, One Kill,
 the battle area not being a straight line means…
 Could it be a Barrier?
 What?
 Just to be safe.
 That should do it. Let’s go.
 Right.
 Now, there’s nowhere left to hide. What will you do?
 To think she’d evade all of my attacks.
 Since it’s come to this, I’ve just got to use that technique!
 Wind Style: Sea Dragon!
 What’s that? Nothing’s happening.
 How pitiful. It seems the wind doesn’t like you.
 I don’t know about that.
 The wind is my friend.
 This battle is just starting.
 Wind Reversal!
 Die!
 Darn it! Hey, let go!
 Done already? I thought we could play a little more…
 That’s the spirit!
 What kind of toy is it this time?
 That’s funny. You think you can defeat me with junk like this?
 The junk is your sword.
 What?! A three-headed dragon!
 You’re just quick to escape, eh?
 Darn it.
 Sure enough, Crow is at a disadvantage
 unless teamed up with Black Ant.
 Not bad, Gaara of the desert.
 How much Chakra is built up in that sand?
 You want to test that out?
 However…
 It’ll be in exchange for your life.
 Sand Coffin!
 Impossible.
 That’s a nice sand bath.
 You, the sand’s Chakra…
 Exactly. This armor sucks up Chakra.
 Aw, is this good night?
 Just sleep as is! For all eternity!!
 What?!
 That was a close shave,
 but Shadow Possession Jutsu was a success!
 Die already!
 Uh, oh!
 What?

 Who are you?
 Who are you guys?
 – An ally of the Sand. – An ally of the Sand.
 – Leaf Shinobi. – Leaf Shinobi
 Believe it!
 He’s not here!
 – They're further ahead. – Right!
 Guys, fight as much as you want.
 I don’t see any Chakra abnormalities in the basin…
 There’s no Barrier.
 Good luck, guys.
 I’ll protect you.

 The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 This is a Hidden Village that has produced many superb Ninjas.
 – Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?! – You're really gonna get it this time!
 The number one prankster of the village, Naruto Uzumaki,
 is a boy who is also striving to become a first-rate Ninja.
 I don't care!
 Transform!
 His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.
 –You fool! – However, Naruto had a secret inside him.
 – Stop making idiotic spells! – that even he didn't know about.
 At one time, the nine-tailed fox drove the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 to the brink of destruction…
 That nine-tailed monster fox is sealed within Naruto's body.
 – Look at that one.  – Therefore, he's been abhorred
 – I hear he's the only one who failed. – as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happen if he becomes a Ninja.
 Okay, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations on your graduation.
 However, that Naruto,
 – Iruka Sensei! – on my sufferance,
 – That hurts! – graduates from the Ninja Academy.
 Say cheese!
 He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.
 Ninja missions are conducted by three-man cells.
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 A descendant of the Uchiha clan,
 a distinguished family in Hidden Leaf Village.
 He is a boy towards whom Naruto harbors intense feelings of rivalry.
 Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi who Naruto has the hots for.
 As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missions with these two rookie Ninjas.
 The one who observes and instructs them,
 Kakashi Hatake, also known as the Copy Ninja,
 is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja.
 One day, Naruto's group takes on the mission to guard Tazuna,
 a master bridge-builder of the Land of Waves.
 All right! We're off!
 However, Tazuna is targeted by a man named Gato
 who attempts to control the Land of the Waves.
 Stop your darned grumbling…!!
 – Next time I'll kill him with... – And Gato had hired a terrifying man
 – head chopper! – for Tazuna's assassination.
 Zabuza Momochi…
 A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hidden in the Mist.
 He was a man who had excelled at Silent Killing and
 had successfully carried out many assassinations.
 Naruto and the gang have a tough time of it
 in the face of Zabuza's attacks…
 Hey! You, with no brows…
 Record in your Bingo Book about the man
 who'll one day become the Leaf Village's Hokage.
 Naruto Uzumaki!!
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow…!
 However, the shoe is on the other foot,
 thanks to Naruto and Sasuke's close team work.
 Kakashi copies Zabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.
 – W-What's that?! – It breaks Zabuza's composure. 78	01:05:42:24	01:05:44:29 Me...?
 R-Ridiculous!
 Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?
 The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!
 No way!
 It's over…
 A Tracker Ninja boy from A Hidden Mist Village
 is the one who delivered the final blow.
 I must get rid this corpse because it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 However, this boy, Haku...
 was Zabuza's comrade.
 Will you be all right the next time?
 The next time…
 I'll be able to see right through the Sharingan.
 Kakashi who has inferred that Zabuza is still alive,
 gives Naruto and gang…
 – Ready!! – new training in preparation... 96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23 – Here I go! 		– for Zabuza's second assault.
 And then, 					One week later...

 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 The time has come!

 is finally here!!

 Now that I've come, you're all right!

 and takes out the enemy in no time!
 Heh… That brat, eh…
 He's long on talk...
 Man, that idiot!

 There's no point if you don't catch the enemy off guard!

 Oh, no!

 To think the enemy attacks would cancel each other out…
 That was super lucky…
 Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!
 Hey! What kind of idiot would attempt
 to cast a Jutsu directly in front of an opponent?!
 What?!
 The essence of a Ninja is deception. How you deceive your opponent.
 Even casting one Jutsu, you avoid the eyes of your opponents,
 catch them off balance, and outsmart them…
 The way you made your entrance earlier, that's just you coming to be a target…
 N-Nooo.
 But I went to the trouble of coming to the rescue.
 What concerns me more than that is…
 That guy…
 Haku… What's the idea?
 Zabuza, leave this kid to me…
 Please let me fight this battle my way.
 What did you say…?
 So you mean no interfering…Haku?
 You're naive…as usual…
 I'm sorry…
 Naive, eh…
 True enough…
 Judging from these wounds,
 there's no mistaking that I was attacked with a Senbon.
 But no vital areas have been targeted so far.
 Does he mean to half-kill me…?
 If so!
 As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!
 It's impossible. lt's too much for Naruto!
 I should be the one to…
 Hey. Don't get any ideas…
 If you move,
 you know what'll happen to that old man, right?
 True…
 If I move away from here and head towards Naruto,
 Zabuza will kill Tazuna.
 No way can Sakura completely protect him by herself.
 How about it?
 Let's just see how those young guys fight against each other.
 That mask…
 You were Zabuza's comrade, after all, weren't you!
 You've got nerve to deceive us!
 I'm sorry.
 But, your teacher also said it, didn't he?
 Things like deceiving and catching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.
 Please don't take it personally.
 You don't have that luxury, either!
 Huh?
 Sasuke?
 I haven't…forgotten about you.
 Here I thought he had disappeared… but he was there…
 I would rather you had just gone down quietly.
 But it looks like it won't work that way.
 Fine. I'll put an end to it first.
 H-Hey!
 Naruto. I'll get to you later.
 W-What's with him…?
 This is it!
 So the real body is over there, eh…
 Okay!
 I'm over here.
 He moved…? How?!
 – Sasuke! 					– Sasuke!
 What was that just now?!
 Sasuke's body suddenly got battered…
 How's he doing it?!
 What kind of Jutsu is he using…?
 It's conceivable that he has clones hide in the mirrors and
 gets them all to throw the Senbons simultaneously…
 No, they're too fast considering…
 What does it mean...
 not being able to see even the trajectory of the weapons…?
 Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu…
 I don't see a reason for these ice mirrors…
 In any case, there's no way to question that these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.
 What I can do is to launch attacks…
 from both the outside and inside.
 The thing to do is to figure out the meaning of the mirror!
 I'll take care of here!
 All there is to do is…
 for me to attack the inside and have Naruto try attacking the mirrors from the outside.
 Yo! I came to save you.
 You okay, Sasuke?
 Oh…
 What good will it do you to catch your ally off guard…?
 Y-You idiot!
 If you're a Shinobi, you'll move more cautiously!
 What's with you?!
 I came to the rescue, you know!
 If you also come inside the mirrors…
 Dang it! I've had it, you fool!
 Fool? What do you mean by fool?!
 As to be expected of the number one unpredictable Ninja.
 He is making the situation worse and worse by coming to aid.
 Since it's come to this, all that is left is to smash the mirrors!
 Fire Style!
 Hey! What're you going to do?!
 These are mirrors made with freezing water…
 If so…
 Fireball Jutsu!
 It's not working at all!
 They won't melt with that level of firepower.
 Darn it! Where'd he attack from?! ls it the clones?
 Where's the real body?!
 It's useless for you to even attempt following with your eyes.
 I absolutely will not be caught.
 Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't!
 If so, I'll find out which is the real body by hitting them all!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses mirrors that can reflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as if you aren't moving at all…
 I knew it!
 Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?!
 Kekkei…Genkai…?
 It's the same type as my Sharingan…
 Deep blood ties… Lineage of paranormal individuals…
 A type of Jutsu that is passed on only through those traits…
 Then…!
 That's right…
 It's impossible even for me to copy that Jutsu…
 And there's no way to destroy that Jutsu, either!
 Darn it…
 So…what?!
 I can't die here yet.
 'Cause I have a dream that I must turn into reality…
 The dream to have my strength recognized by everyone in the village…
 and become the Hokage!
 Dream…
 Pathetic brat.
 Brats like you aren't needed by anyone
 and die without ever knowing any freedom or dreams…
 You have the same eyes as I do…
 For me, becoming a Shinobi completely is difficult.
 If I can, I don't want to kill you guys…
 And I don't want to get killed by you guys…
 But if you guys are going to come at me…
 I'll kill my feelings with a sword and completely become a Shinobi.
 This bridge is the battleground that connects each of us to our dreams.
 I, for the sake of my dream.
 And you, for the sake of your dreams.
 Please don't hold it against me…
 I want to protect the person dear to me…
 I work for the sake of that person, I fight for that person,
 and I want to make that person's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 For the sake of the dream, I will completely become a Shinobi...
 and kill you guys!
 Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!
 Cuz' I've finally discovered the way to break through it!
 Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.
 Let's pull out of this place and go assist Kakashi Sensei.
 I've had this bad feeling from a while ago.
 Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow until we get there.
 Next episode:  ""Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters.""
 As for me, I'll kick butt once again!

72,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 I’ll let you out of here.
 And I’ll grant you one wish, too.
 You don’t have to worry.
 Your strong will is going to remain as Residual Aura inside me.
 It’s not like you’ll lose everything.
 Now then, your flesh is mine.
 With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body has once again
 become unable to reanimate for several years.
 However there’s a next time…
 I-Indeed. My body no longer has value as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for me who has lost everything…
 to find my own calling.
 I’ve finally understood that.
 Even if it’s not me…
 I’ll bring in the new “vessel,” even if it costs me my life.
 That’s my repayment to Lord Orochimaru.
 That’s the only redemption for me… who was worthless.
 Miscalculation: A New Enemy Appears!
 They’re fast.
 Akamaru.
 Come quick after you’ve set the bombs!
 Oh no!
 All right.
 Great.
 Akamaru, well done.
 Messing with me.
 Akamaru.
 Don’t you “arf” me, you mutt!
 I’ll waste you.
 Hold on.
 You!
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Damn it.
 What’s happening?
 You punks!
 Where are Kiba and Akamaru?!
 Another one’s come.
 We have no choice.
 I’ll take care of this, so you take the coffin and go on ahead.
 Shikamaru…
 Get going already.
 Wh-Why are you…?
 I’m sorry, Naruto. lt’s my miscalculation.
 Kimimaro.
 You were taking too long, Tayuya.
 And what happened to the other three?
 Being none other than those of the former “Sound Ninja Five.”
 Why are you…?
 Your body… Your body’s no longer…
 I’m not moving with the flesh anymore. lt’s mental power.
 Man, you cheater of death…
 I understand a little now, that feeling…
 of being information that has escaped from the prison of the flesh.
 The feeling of experiencing a taste of Lord Orochimaru’s dream.
 Orochimaru…!
 This vessel…is an important vessel for the dream…
 The flesh that Lord Orochimaru truly desires.
 But you guys were a bit too late.
 Some dangerous guy has appeared again.
 That air about him is nothing ordinary.
 Anyway, we need to sort out the situation.
 If we were to carelessly plunge in…
 You jerk. What’re you babbling nonsense?
 Naruto!
 Give back Sasuke!
 Hey, wait!
 Tayuya.
 The reason why I won’t kill you now
 is because you have a mission you have to complete.
 And my mission is to deliver that to Lord Orochimaru.
 Isn’t it too late now?
 Humph. I told you.
 That’s the body that Lord Orochimaru truly desires.
 The next vessel, huh?
 That’s right…
 And this is the only thing that I can do at present.
 I leave those two pieces of garbage to you.
 Sasuke…
 That punk!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 How can I calm down?
 At this rate, Sasuke will get far away again.
 Naruto’s right.
 This is a mission to bring Sasuke back to the Leaf Village.
 We must choose what would be the most rational means
 to execute the mission.
 Damned punks.
 I’ll finish this in a flash.
 Naruto, listen up.
 Please move according to the plan that I’m going to tell you.
 He’s a classic close-range combat-type fool
 with Shadow Clone Jutsu as his only saving grace.
 And he’s a middle-range combat type
 who binds his enemies with a Jutsu using shadows…
 and a sharp squad leader, huh?
 Got it?
 Yeah.
 Come on already, you punks.
 It’s two versus one. We’ve got the upper hand.
 It’s an opponent we can beat if we team up.
 Let’s go, Naruto.
 All right.
 With garbage like you jerks,
 it doesn’t matter how many of you are there.
 Don’t underestimate our teamwork.
 Let’s go!
 Bring it.
 Now... Naruto.
 I’ll blow you away.
 Gotcha. The strategy is a success.
 Farewell.
 Blast.
 You tricked me.
 Teamwork, my foot. You little punks…
 Blast.
 You wouldn’t fall for the same trick over and over, huh..?
 Small fry… You’ve got nerve.
 Well, I guess I’ll settle for just having been able to let him get away.
 Remember this.
 It’s not just Jutsu that are weapons.
 I’m counting on you, Shikamaru.
 Hang in there, Sasuke.
 But that kid,
 how wonderful it is that he can move with that body, eh?
 Kabuto, I don’t know what kind of order you gave him,
 but it’s a bit harsh.
 Not at all. lt wasn’t an order.
 I don’t like to force things.
 He acted on his own.
 For you whom he reveres.
 Kabuto…You’ve really got a hateful personality, don’t you?
 Lord Orochimaru.
 To you, Kimimaro was a perfect existence…
 His thoughts were steeped in darkness in the same way as yours.
 And he sanctified you.
 And he fanatically admired and revered you.
 Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan with the strongest and perfect bodies
 being the legitimate bloodline of their Kekkai Genkai…
 until a short time ago.
 Yes…
 When I think about having lost him, I still get a chill down my spine.
 I think about it even now…
 The man I truly wished for… The body I wanted the most…Kimimaro.
 And if only he hadn’t been stricken with disease,
 the assassination of the Hokage would’ve gone smoother.
 Seal!
 My arms….
 Now…you can no longer use either of your arms…
 And since you can't use your arms,
 you can't weave Sign…
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushing the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
 Orochimaru, you fool…
 It's unfortunate that we can't leave together but, my disciple…
 Let's meet in the other world one day…
 Sasuke… Sasuke’s not here yet?
 We wouldn’t have needed to go through such an experience.
 In the world, very often things don’t go as we want them to.
 It’s only a matter of time, Lord Orochimaru.
 When Tayuya…comes back, I’ll kill her.
 Hold it.
 Hey…!
 Now then, how shall I defeat you?
 You…
 Those eyes…
 It seems he possesses a peculiar Chakra.
 What does Orochimaru want to do…? Why’s he after Sasuke?
 Lord Orochimaru has already obtained Immortality Jutsu…
 A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu and obtain everything in the world.
 What does that have to do with Sasuke?!
 “Immortal” doesn’t mean that the flesh is being maintained as is…
 Before his body decays,
 a strong and new flesh will be made into a vessel for his soul.
 That’s…
 Are you saying that’s Sasuke?!
 Yes… That’s right.
 I won’t let such a thing happen!
 Idiot… What will come of sending one shrimp punk in pursuit?
 And looking at things in terms of time,
 up until now you probably sacrificed one member each time
 in order for the group to move forward.
 Is that guy called Sasuke that important?
 How many of your men do you intend to sacrifice for the sake of just one person?
 You incompetent punk.
 Heh… Indeed…
 For me, this is my first mission as a platoon leader.
 It’s very disquieting having comrades gradually whittled down,
 and I didn’t know if my own judgments were correct or not.
 As a squad leader with the lives of the party in my hands…
 respecting the lives in the four-member party,
 rather than the life of one person taken by the enemy…
 and deciding to abort a mission that’s too dangerous, would be by the book.
 Then, why didn’t you do that?
 The world doesn’t go by the book very often…
 Since not one person in my squad would do something like
 abandon a captured comrade and give up fighting for the sake of their own safety.
 Me included.
 Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,
 I am not cut out to be a squad leader who gives orders to comrades.
 The only thing I can do for them... is to have faith in them.
 Listen. I’m not thinking anything like they were sacrifices.
 I’m not thinking anything like they’ve died.
 Don’t mock my comrades.
 I got you.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesn’t…look so good.
 I’ll play a melody of death for you.
 Don’t you mock us, you damned punk.
 I won’t let you take Sasuke, no matter what.
 Interesting.
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 Damn it! What'll I do?!
 He's trouble enough yet,
 but his Chakra has increased several ten-fold!
 It's no good. I can't use it here yet.
 But if I stay like this, we'll…
 I get it, Akamaru.
 It's like you said.
 I have no choice but to use it!

 Good work, Akamaru! You nailed it!
 Midair Dynamic Marking!
 Next, three twists!
 Aim carefully!
 Can one call that a walk? No, I don’t think one can.
 I can’t gather insects at ease.
 It’s so great…
 that the three of you have things you’re good at and that you love…
 I hope you’ll find something like that too, Hinata.
 You're right…
 And, what is it?
 You had something to tell me, didn’t you?
 Umm…
 Yeah…
 So, using that as a hint,
 think about the fastest way to get to the destination.
 Start!
 Everyone!
 I’m sorry this happens all the time, but class is over for today.
 Yippee!
 – Why? 					– Huh? Not again.
 The handout is your homework!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 I’m so happy we didn’t have the class for Taijutsu.
 But these days, class either finishes in the morning
 or we have the whole day off…
 I wonder if that’s really okay.
 What’s up with acting like a serious student?
 Right, Konohamaru?
 Huh?
 Konohamaru?
 Konohamaru!
 What do you think you’re doing with Grandpa's things?!
 Honorable grandson…
 Those belong to my Grandpa!
 Where are you taking them?!
 Uh…you mean these?
 They are no longer used,
 so I thought I’d put them into storage in a different location.
 No longer used, you say…
 You think it’s okay to take Grandpa’s things away without permission?!
 The Fifth Hokage will be using the chambers, you know.
 The Fifth Hokage?
 Y-Yes.
 The next Hokage has finally been decided.
 The village can have peace of mind now.
 That person apparently doesn’t smoke tobacco…
 What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!
 It’s too soon for that!
 When you depended on the Old Man up to recently!
 What a lovely fragrance…
 Huh?!
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 That’s exactly my question for you!
 You perverted kid…
 I dare you to say that again!
 Huh? You want me to say it again?
 Per-vert-ed kid!
 Don’t call me that!
 Lady Tsunade!
 The elders are all waiting, so we had better hurry.
 Yes, I know.
 Be careful, little boy.
 Please be more conscious of your actions.
 I’m the person who has to deal with the complaints…
 Okay, okay.
 I’m not a little boy!
 Who the heck are you?!
 That’s my question…
 Naruto!
 Konohamaru?
 Long time no see!
 Hey, more importantly, have you seen a big-boobed, scary old lady…
 I mean, young lady?
 I did see her!
 – Where did she go?! – Who the heck is she?!
 Who is she?
 She has to go to the hospital straightaway!
 Hospital?
 That lady may not look it,
 but she’s an awesome Medical Corps Ninja!
 She finally came back to the village to become the Hokage, so…
 what is she taking her sweet time for?!
 Hokage…
 The Fifth Hokage.
 She better do what she promised to do.
 You’re lying…
 Huh?
 I don’t believe you!
 It’s a lie!
 What?
 There are seven birds within 50 meters behind me in the direction of the “2.”
 Tenten…?
 Neji!
 I just heard that that Lady Tsunade has returned!
 It’s the real McCoy. Wanna go see her?
 Sorry.
 But I’m not interested.
 Huh?
 So there were…
 eight birds, huh…
 Listen carefully, Tsunade.
 We must call the feudal lords
 and announce the fact that the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.
 We will start preparations today for the inauguration ceremony in the village.
 Feudal lords and ceremonies are just a big pain.
 Tsunade!
 Yes, yes, I know… This is also the job of the Hokage.
 – Genma! 					– Here!
 – Aoba! 					– Here!
 Issue an official notice and
 convey this matter to those in the village within the next few days.
 We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.
 – Yes, ma'am! 					– Yes, ma'am!
 I hate you, Grandpa!
 Why did you have to die?
 The Fifth Hokage…
 Gimme a break, my shoulders are so stiff.
 I wish I could just down a nice cup of hot sake and relax.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Wait a second!
 Before you do that,
 you have something else you need to do, Old Lady Tsunade!
 What was it?
 I told you, didn’t I?!
 About Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke and Bushy Brow!
 Oh…right, right.
 Hey, if it isn’t Naruto!
 Huh? Shikamaru?
 Why are you in a place like this?
 That’s my question–
 Why are you in a place like this?
 I have no idea why,
 but my father told me to come along with him.
 What’s up with that?
 Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.
 Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.
 Are you taking proper care of the deer?
 The antlers of the deer from that area make very good medicine.
 Yes, I’m somehow managing.
 Hey, Naruto, who’s that person
 who acts like such a big shot when she's so young?
 That’s apparently the new Hokage.
 Huh?!
 Despite her appearance, she’s an old lady in her fifties.
 Yikes!
 Well, see you again sometime.
 Yes, ma’am.
 All right, to the hospital!
 See you later, Shikamaru.
 I’m will show you an awesome new technique I learned!
 That’s the new Fifth Hokage…?
 Hey, Shikamaru.
 That person is the strongest and most beautiful person in the world.
 Huh?
 I mean, she’s the lone female amongst the Legendary Sannin.
 Huh… A female Hokage?
 I’m not very comfortable with women…
 Huh?
 Even though they're unusually frank, they always hang around and
 you're never quite sure whose side they're on.
 They always think they can make men do whatever they want.
 Anyway, they’re just a pain.
 Hey Shikamaru…
 Without women, men wouldn’t be born.
 If women weren’t around, nothing good would come of men.
 No matter how hard-edged a woman might be,
 she’ll show her gentle side to the man she loves.
 I can’t believe that Pa’s saying that…
 when he's tied to Mom’s apron strings.
 You’ll understand once you reach that age.
 Oh no!
 Let’s hurry up and get our business done…
 because Mom will chew us out if we’re late.
 Hurry up, Shikamaru!
 Looks like nothing will come of some men
 even if they have a woman.
 Konoha Hospital
 I’m coming in.
 Who are you…?
 What a beautiful woman…
 Sakura, Sakura!
 Everything will be all right now!
 I brought along an awesome person.
 Sasuke will be fine now!
 Naruto…
 Those two flowers aren’t from the same day.
 So this kid is coming here every day, huh…
 I heard from Guy Sensei…
 Please save Sasuke.
 OK, leave it to me.
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke, you…!
 Hmm, despite his appearance, that Naruto is pretty considerate.
 Huh?
 Next! Next!
 How disgraceful!
 To be taken down by just two insurgents.
 And here I thought you were a genius.
 I’m sorry…
 All right! Kakashi Sensei’s done!
 Next, Bushy Brow!
 Please hurry up and take a look at my disciple Lee!
 Lee!
 I brought Lady Tsunade here!
 That’s your disciple?
 Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!
 I see…
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 Is it really okay for you to be idling away your time here like this?
 Uh, I almost forgot!
 I had an appointment to meet Iruka Sensei!
 Go on!
 OK! I’ll leave the rest in your hands!
 All right!
 Hey, Naruto!
 You’re late, Iruka Sensei!
 Sorry, sorry.
 There were lots of things to do with respect to the Fifth Hokage.
 I guess…
 Thanks for waiting!
 I’m digging in!
 Naruto.
 Huh…?
 You have really developed compared to the time when you wanted this.
 I have, haven’t I?
 You think so too, right?
 This headband that I received from Iruka Sensei
 suits me perfectly, don’t you think?
 Stop being so cocky!
 You still have a long, long way to go!
 You have lots of work to do!
 Listen carefully, Naruto!
 The Leaf Village is in a very difficult situation right now.
 Starting with the Third Hokage, we lost many fine Shinobi.
 The current strength of the Leaf is less than half what it normally is.
 Despite that, we must continue to carry out our missions.
 Why is that?
 If you don’t have enough manpower, you should turn it down.
 No, that won’t do…
 If we turn down our missions,
 it would be like announcing to other countries our weakened state.
 Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing will probably be assigned to missions.
 I see…these are difficult times.
 Hey! This concerns you too!
 You need to play an active role and carry out your duties
 in order to aid Lady Tsunade.
 Yeah.
 But, before I do that, I need to satisfy my stomach.
 That’s just like you.
 Do your best!
 Seconds!
 Hey, hey! How'd you finish so fast?!
 I'll be straight with you.
 Give up being a Shinobi.
 L-Lady Tsunade… don’t joke like that.
 There are numerous bone fragments in the area around important nerves.
 Moreover, they are deeply embedded.
 You’re not physically capable of carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.
 Come now, Lady Tsunade, don’t joke like that…
 Even if I were to operate…
 Don’t be fooled, Lee!
 That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!
 You changed yourself using the Transformation Jutsu,
 you evil woman!
 Who the heck are you?!
 Don’t I have any…chance?
 There is no one besides me who is capable of doing the surgery
 and it would take too much time.
 Furthermore, there is a huge risk…
 Risk?
 The probability of a successful surgery is 50% at best,
 and if it fails…
 You’ll die.
 Guy Sensei!
 I’m not at all ready to throw in the towel!
 Guy Sensei, what’s this god-awful bitter rice dumpling?
 They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.
 If you eat one hundred of them, they should heal your wound.
 I see, if I don’t eat one hundred of them,
 my wound won’t heal, right?
 N-Not in a single day!
 It’s better that you give up being a Shinobi and look for a different path.
 Lee…
 Lee…
 If I knew this was going to happen, I shouldn’t have brought you to him.
 Don’t say that…!
 I am painfully aware of how you feel, but it’s better to be clear.
 Because it’s something he’ll have to understand sooner or later.
 The longer we wait…
 the harder it will be for him.
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Konohamaru, just come out from there already!
 Shut up!
 Listen, I'll treat you to a bowl of ramen!
 Don't want any!
 OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.
 You're such a pest!
 What did you just say?!
 In that case, I'll pull you out by force!
 Be ready for that!

74,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 The Enemy of the Byakugan
 They blew up… They blew up and died!
 As I expected, I’m not sad.
 You really can’t hold funerals feeling like this, huh…
 Four of them are still alive.
 Can’t be! After being hit by my Lightning Fang…
 No…
 If you say so, it has to be true.
 One…is troublesome…
 The enemy was nearby… But I couldn’t see anything.
 It’s strange…
 Even if it’s the Hidden Mist Jutsu,
 my Byakugan should be able to see through it.
 Byakugan!
 For sure this time…
 I can see it!
 Southwest 52 degrees 2!
 Southeast 12 degrees 3!
 Southeast 8 degrees 1!
 Northwest 24 degrees 11!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Let’s go!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 No way!
 Why?!
 U-zu-ma-ki Barrage!
 I missed!
 H-Help me!
 Bushy Brow…?
 Th-The enemy disappeared!
 It can’t be… The false images with Chakra Networks?
 One at the middle of the cliff, one at the bottom of the cliff,
 one on the right, one on the left.
 We can’t hold funerals,
 but I’ll take care of them without leaving any trace.
 Thunder Funeral: Feast of Lightning!
 The corpses are warm.
 We’re strong…you and I.
 No, it’s you.
 Ranmaru, you’re strong. With you I’m also strong.
 Wait… They aren’t dead yet. They’re just unconscious.
 They’re stubborn.
 Okay, if grilling doesn’t work, then let’s chop them.
 Flesh and even bone… I’ll crush them nicely.
 Ranmaru…! Are you all right?!
 Hang in there, Ranmaru!
 Ranmaru…!
 I’m okay.
 Raiga…
 This person…is still unconscious.
 What did you say?
 It’s amazing…
 He is fighting only with muscle memory.
 It’s a nice face. lt burns into my heart.
 Let’s hold a funeral for him…
 I am sure it will be one that will make me cry!
 From the right!
 What’s with this guy…?
 He’s hard to read. The moves…
 But for your sake, Raiga, I’ll do my best.
 Together, okay!
 Left!
 Right!
 From the front! Jump! Now!
 You…you…you!
 What?
 How can this guy… get to this point?
 B-Bushy Brows…
 Lee… Could he have lost consciousness…?
 Tenten! Neji!
 Raiga! Turn around!
 What…? That voice right now…?
 Wha–?!
 Raiga!
 Ranmaru!
 This is…
 Neji…
 Ranmaru!
 Move!
 Huh? Somehow…it felt like I was fighting in my dreams…
 Ranmaru…
 You!
 Heh! Naruto Uzumaki arrives!
 Naruto…
 Just die already…
 Hey! I have something I want to ask you!
 You… I heard you’re one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 So what if I was?!
 You know Zabuza, right?!
 You also know… one called Kisame, right?!
 I…hate them! Who wants to remember them?!
 I hate you too!
 Then!
 I’ll make you tell me by force!
 A clone?!
 You… You’re weaker than a moment ago.
 Wh-What…?
 Lightning Ball!
 Damn…
 Huh, you are tough…
 Lightning Ball!
 Seconds, please…
 Grandma Sansho?
 What’s wrong?
 Oh my. That’s bad lightning.
 It was flashing like that too when Karashi went to the village.
 Oh my…that light is like poison…
 Naruto!
 It’s not…working at all.
 I’m not going to remember your smile!
 Die!
 Ranmaru…where are you?
 What is in this bag…?
 Byakugan!
 There’s…in here…
 Could it be?
 This powder was… hiding the Chakra Networks?
 It’s even creating the Chakra Network!
 Naruto! Do the Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 But he saw all the shadow clones…
 Don’t worry. His eyes are right here!
 Ranmaru! I’m gonna come save you after I defeat this guy!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Come bring it on!
 Lightning Ball!
 What? Was the one before a lucky hit?
 Stop messing around. All I have to do is defeat you all, right?!
 Let’s go!
 We’re not done yet!
 You…
 At this rate…my Chakra will…
 The mist… The Hidden Mist Jutsu is fading away…
 Damn! I’ll finish them off at once!
 Damn!
 I am not going to let you get away!
 Wait!
 Ninja Art: Boulder Avalanche.
 Naruto!
 Naruto…
 Did you see that…?!
 Yeah, I saw it!
 Prepare yourself!
 Stop it!
 I can’t stop!
 I…did it.
 This is…Raiga’s eye…?
 Such a big eye ball!
 Huh?
 You’re wrong… lt’s a human being!
 Huh…?!
 In my dream…
 I guess you were the one I was fighting against.
 It wasn’t me… lt was Raiga and me together…
 Together…?
 Always…since that time…
 Don’t act like you’re asleep. You are going to die…
 Don’t move!
 There is a spy in this village who snuck into the Hidden Mist Village…
 We came to kill those guys, but…
 I got confused about who I had to kill. That’s why I am doing it randomly…
 Wh-What are you saying?
 It’s fine… lf I am going to be killed by you.
 Huh…? Why is it fine for me to kill you…?
 You were…always crying…
 Huh? Me…cry?
 In your heart… seeking the meaning of living.
 I was always watching…you.
 What…are you?
 I am the same as you… living is painful.
 I don’t understand the meaning of living.
 Because of my sickness, I couldn’t go outside…
 Shunned by everyone,
 all I could do was to take a peek of the world from this blanket…
 But …if with my death,
 if you are able to feel the meaning of life even a little…
 My life was not needed from the beginning.
 Please…
 Are you…alone?
 Come with me.
 From now on, you and I are two as one.
 From that day on, I became Raiga’s eyes and ears.
 Raiga became my hands and feet.
 The outside world that I dashed into for the very first time…
 it was filled with things I had never seen or heard before.
 It was fun.
 Whenever and wherever, I was with Raiga.
 No matter when it was,
 there wasn’t a time that we were separated.
 We were trying to find the meaning of life by living for each other.
 We were convinced that was the meaning to living.
 That’s why…
 If Raiga is not around,
 I no longer have the power to live by myself.
 I’ve lost the purpose to live…
 Do you have someone precious to you?
 I want to protect someone important to me…
 I want to make his dream come true, and that’s my dream.
 Often people have it wrong…
 mistakenly believing that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness.
 They spare the foe whose life is in their hands.
 It’s not mercy to me at all…
 Do you know the agony of just living without dreams and being unwanted?
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi. You’ve taken away my reason for living.
 I no longer need to live.
 Don’t say such stupid things.
 Naruto… Please kill me!
 Huh?
 What are you doing?
 Now, quickly.
 Why are you hesitating…?
 With my arms and legs torn apart, I have no means to resist, you know.
 You should carry out your mission….
 Hurry and deliver your finishing blow.
 Our mission is to force out the Kurosuki Family from this village…
 Without Raiga, he cannot be of any threat to this village.
 The problem right now is that
 the Kurosuki Family members have lost their leadership.
 Once the hoop comes off, we don’t know what they will do.
 For this mission… this is the finishing touch.
 Yeah, but what are we going to do with him?
 Is he a villain worth tying up?
 No, he is not.
 He might kill himself, right?
 Once the mission is over, we will come save you right away…
 A Chakra Sealing tag?
 We can’t help it. He is an enemy, after all…
 We should assume he has other Jutsu. Just in case!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Rokusuke and the others went back to the village,
 so I say the mission is complete.
 Except Lee.
 Oh, oh yeah.
 Bushy Brow said he was going to straighten Karashi’s spirit.
 I wonder if it’s going to be that easy.
 It seems like there will be some trouble.
 Hey, why are you saying that?!
 No, not Karashi, but this weather.

 I see. There’s going to be a storm.

 Dang it!
 Darn it! Things will really be bad if it stays like this…!
 I’ll have to…
 I’ll have to save… everyone for sure!
 Light vs. Dark: The Two Faces of Gaara!
 So you’ll fight for the sake of others?!
 That’s why you guys are only at that level!
 You don’t need a reason to fight!
 Only the one who remains undefeated can actually feel his own existence!
 Come on, forget about your insignificant friends
 and fight only for the sake of your own existence!
 Insignificant…
 friends?
 Those who hold silly sentiments about fighting
 should just die!
 I'm sick of listening to you talk!
 I'll clobber you for sure!
 You guys misunderstand real strength!
 Shut up!
 W-Why…? Why is it?!
 Why Yashamaru…?
 Why did you, why…?
 Why…?
 Love is…
 a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person.
 Just like my older sister did.
 You are a precious person who is close to me, Gaara!
 Always… only Yashamaru would always…
 Me…always me…
 It was an order.
 I was commissioned to kill you…
 By your father…
 Lord Kazekage.
 My father…?
 Why did my father…?
 Why…? Why me?
 Gaara, you who were born and possessed by the Sand Spirit Shukaku…
 have been watched over as an experiment.
 However, Gaara, you couldn’t control the living spirit Shukaku,
 the Sand Spirit which possesses the power of the sand.
 Eventually your existence would become too dangerous for the village.
 Before that occurred…
 So Yashamaru, you had not choice…
 but to comply with my father’s order…?
 No… That is not correct.
 It is true I accepted Lord Kazekage’s order.
 But if I had wanted to turn it down, I could have turned it down.
 Gaara…
 Deep down in my heart, I probably…
 hated you.
 You, whose birth took the life of my beloved older sister.
 The child she left behind in death…
 Thinking that you were her remembrance, I tried desperately to love you.
 However… I was not able to.
 My sister didn’t choose to have you.
 My sister became a sacrifice for the village,
 and she died while cursing this village!
 From that time, I probably…
 have been burdened with a wound of the heart that could never heal.
 Unlike a wound on the body, there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
 A wound of the heart?
 Your name… is the name my sister gave you.
 ""This child’s name is Gaara…
 ""A devil that loves only itself…
 ""Love only yourself…
 ""And fight only for your own sake.
 ""If you do that, you will continue to exist.""
 Such was the hope it contained.
 However…
 my sister did not give you this name
 because she was concerned about you or loved you.
 The reason she gave you this name, a name so you would continue to exist…
 …was so that the deep-seated hatred of my sister
 who died hating and cursing this village…
 would remain…
 and be known to all!
 You were never…loved!
 This is the last…
 Please die…
 I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.
 Love?
 The sand automatically trying to protect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filled with your mother’s will.
 Love.
 Love only yourself.
 And fight only for your own sake.
 So that is Gaara… That is me.
 I finally understand.
 I am alone.
 I will no longer believe in anyone… or love anyone.
 I am alone!
 Yes, I am all by myself.
 What’s the matter? Hurry up and come at me!
 Don't you care what happens to your so-called precious friends?!
 Sakura!
 Dang it!
 Naruto’s not his usual self…
 Did something happen between them?
 In any case…
 In any case, I need to save Sakura!
 But… what to do?!
 That’s it!
 Since it's come to this… Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra…
 There’s no choice but to summon the Chief Gamabunta!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What’s this?! You’re a little kid!
 If you want something from me, give me some snack!
 If you don’t, I won’t play with you!
 You know something? I hate you frogs!
 What did you say?! Don’t make fun of amphibians! Really!
 Jeez, I don’t have time to play with you, little squirt!
 Darn! Why is it…?
 I practiced for so long, but with this, there’s no other way…
 I need to save everyone!
 Everyone…you say?
 Don’t make me laugh.
 I fight…only for myself!
 He…he’s transforming again!
 If you don’t take me down, the sand over this girl won’t fall away!
 Not only that, as time passes…
 this sand will slowly squeeze tighter and eventually suffocate this girl!
 Sakura!
 He’s getting closer and closer to being a Perfect Possession.
 That Jutsu hasn’t been activated yet,
 but at this rate, I’ll also be…!
 Those eyes…
 Sand Shuriken!
 You’re…really weak!
 Shut up!
 But what is that guy?
 You’re persistent… Sarutobi Sensei!
 I-It doesn’t move?!
 Y-You hard-to-kill fools!
 Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?
 The Leaf Village is my home!
 I told you I am the pillar of that house!
 That’s why I’m saying I will break that pillar!
 As long as the people of the village
 fiercely fight to protect their dear comrades,
 the pillar of the Leaf Village will not be broken by the likes of you!
 I wonder about that.
 Do not underestimate the Hokage!
 I-Impossible…!
 Where is…? Most of your Chakra should be gone!
 Chakra and Ninjutsu are not all there is to strength!
 W-What lonely eyes…
 Such lonely eyes…
 This guy is also turning into a monster… the same as me.
 I hated every last one of them.
 I didn’t understand who I was,
 why I was so hated, why I even existed.
 In other words,
 you’re the Nine-Tailed Fox who killed lruka’s parents and ruined the village!
 You’ve been deceived by everyone in the village all along!
 I…
 When I learned that the Nine-Tailed Fox was inside me,
 everyone in the village seemed even more cold-hearted…
 I was so deeply troubled…
 But…
 Naruto! Let’s go have ramen for a change!
 Yay! I will, I will!
 I’ll have the one with extra BBQ pork slices!
 Huh! You loser… lf you want to beat me train harder!
 Shut up! I won’t lose to you!
 Hey Naruto! What did Sasuke say about me?
 He didn’t say anything…
 By the way! By the way! Wouldn't you rather know how I feel…?
 Oh! Really, Sakura!
 I’m gonna eat now!
 Um… Naruto, you’ll really die if you eat only noodles and sweet red bean porridge.
 You’re a Ninja, so eat more vegetables!
 Here, have some!
 What?! I don’t like vegetables!
 People appeared  who acknowledged me…
 That’s why I became all right,
 even though there was the demon fox inside my body,
 or even if the people of the village looked at me with cold eyes.
 Because… I wasn’t alone anymore!
 I never imagined how happy and fortunate I could feel.
 How really…really…
 great it was.
 How truly great it was to be here.
 I was relieved to know I am allowed to be here, to exist!
 That’s why it scares me to think about the past…
 That suffering is agonizing…
 It’s a pitch-black hell!
 If…I had remained that way, all alone…
 That’s precisely why I understand!
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 This is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 I don’t know what happened, but…
 This guy’s always been suffering all alone…
 Even now, without ever feeling relief…
 Only able to believe in himself…
 Even now, he’s battling in hell…
 That’s how it is…
 To him, someone like me who's acknowledged by others…
 might seem like a weakling in a world of happiness without tension…
 Can I really win against a guy like this?
 What’s the matter?! Are you afraid of me?
 To fight for the sake of oneself? To fight for the sake of others?
 You should just love yourself, and fight for yourself!
 That is the definition of the strongest one!
 Now fight me!
 What happened to the boldness you had earlier?!
 Show me your strength! I’ll throw that strength to the ground!
 Now what’s the matter?! lf you don’t fight me, I’ll kill that girl!
 Darn it!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Wind Style!
 Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!
 This isn’t good… He really got me.
 First, I’ll toy with you without killing you!
 I look forward to seeing when and how you give up
 and abandon your friends!
 Naruto…
 But…what is it?
 It’s far from over!
 N-Naruto…
 What is this…this feeling?
 Sand Shuriken!
 D-Dang it!
 Dang it!
 H-He's…
 What is this?! This feeling that’s overcoming me?
 Naruto…!
 For some reason… I don’t want to lose to this guy…
 You…
 …even if I die!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.

 What do you mean by monitoring Akamaru?
 You know about the incident
 where someone from outside infiltrated the village, right?
 Yeah, I know about that.
 But I heard that Kiba and the others resolved that incident without any trouble.
 That’s right.
 Damn! That Kiba!
 I want a mission where I totally kick an enemy’s butt.
 To be exact, that’s wrong.
 What?
 Before Kiba and the others had the intruder in custody…
 he swallowed a pellet and killed himself.
 What? Suicide…?
 In the investigation that followed,
 it was revealed that the enemy was a Shinobi
 from another land that uses a unique tactic.
 Perhaps he took his own life in order to seal that power.
 What’s the “unique” tactic?
 Something you would call a biological weapon.
 Biological weapon?
 It’s a particular pathogen…
 a terrible weapon where someone infected will gradually lose oneself
 and have their body taken over.
 But how is that connected with monitoring Akamaru?
 Could it be that Akamaru was…?!
 There’s a possibility he’s infected.
 He still doesn’t look so well.
 Y-Yeah…
 Since Akamaru’s not in his best condition,
 I’m skipping training today as well.
 Okay…
 Oh!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Shino?!
 Shino, do something quick!
 Shino!
 The insects suddenly stopped listening to me.
 Jeez, give me a break.
 I’m sorry.
 We’ll head back early for the time being. See ya.
 I hope… Akamaru gets better soon.
 Shino?
 It’s the first time the insects have attacked a comrade…
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Oh, shoot! I’ve been spotted!
 What’re you doing, Naruto?
 Wh-What, you ask?
 I’m developing a new Jutsu, believe it!
 So as for me, I’m busy and…
 Kiba's Long Day
 Is there no mistake, Sis?
 I’d say the possibility at this point is around fifty-fifty.
 I still haven’t been able to identify it,
 but these are the lab results of the blood drawn from Akamaru…
 But! It could be some kind of mistake!
 Do you think I, a veterinarian, would make such a mistake?
 Yeah… You’re right.
 What is it, Akamaru?!
 Let go! Let go!
 Akamaru, it’s Naruto. It’s okay to let go.
 Hey, Akamaru!
 Akamaru!
 What did you do that for Akamaru?
 I mean, what’re you doing in the front yard of my house?
 Huh? Well, that’s…
 Anyway, come in.
 For the time being, I have to fulfill my responsibility as the owner.
 What?
 What?!
 Geez! Biting a comrade of the same village can’t be allowed!
 Are you training him properly, Kiba?!
 All right.
 It’s finished! Perfect if I do say so myself!
 Sis! That looks just like a surgical scar!
 What? Really? I thought it turned out well, though…
 Sorry, Naruto.
 Have Sakura or someone patch them up for you!
 Hm? Right…
 See ya.
 Right.
 See you later too, Miss Hana!
 Akamaru…
 I’m telling you,
 there’s nothing else other than my pants getting all torn up.
 Shino’s insects attacked Akamaru…
 He even attacked Naruto, whom he should know very well.
 There’s trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 It seems they were attacked by someone
 in the middle of night training.
 Looks like they launched a sneak attack with quite a few men.
 No, it seems there was just one culprit.
 What?! All of this by one person?!
 To be precise, that’s not correct.
 It’s one animal.
 There’s no doubt.
 There’s trouble, Kiba!
 You’re talking about the incident
 where Shinobi were attacked during night training last night, right…?
 It-It can’t be!
 It seems it’s as you said, Sis…
 I can smell blood from Akamaru.
 That’s Kiba Inuzuka’s Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?
 You jerks. What do you want with Akamaru?!
 A warrant…?
 Kiba…!
 Yes, there’s no mistake.
 Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,
 the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept
 under the supervision of the Anbu Black Ops.
 – Damn it! 					– Kiba!
 We should obey the Lady Hokage’s order.
 Damn it!
 Akamaru…
 Here.
 Thanks, Sis.
 This contains medicine that I prepared,
 so give it to the vet over there.
 Right. I’m off, then.
 Naruto…?
 What’s the idea of Akamaru being detained?!
 Akamaru is the culprit from last night’s incident.
 We have sufficient proof as well.
 At this point, it’s an unavoidable measure.
 The Medical Team is now desperately looking for a way to save Akamaru.
 Don’t worry too much.
 If…that doesn’t work either, what’ll happen to Akamaru?
 At that time…
 there’ll be nothing left to do but to put Akamaru down!
 Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital
 You don’t need to worry.
 The Medical Corps will figure something out soon.
 Right…
 Take care on your way home.
 Right.
 Akamaru…
 I won’t hand you over to anyone.
 It seems Kiba Inuzuka has taken Akamaru and fled.
 Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?
 In preparation for the worst,
 have the Special Pursuit Corps stand by here!
 The Special Pursuit Corps…
 C-Could it be that you’re really going to kill Akamaru…Grandma?
 Grandma Tsunade!
 It’s hard for me, too.
 Damn it!
 Did you find them?!
 No!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 He’s rapidly getting worse.
 Akamaru!
 Where are they?
 They should be around here.
 I swore to protect him, no matter what!
 I swore never I’d never let him go through that experience ever again…!
 The Special Pursuit Corps has assembled.
 Show the team in.
 Kiba!
 Where are you?!
 I guess I was able to hide my tracks somewhat…
 This is a serum for Akamaru that the Medical Corps whipped up.
 I can’t guarantee the level of effect.
 There’s maybe a fifty-percent chance of survival.
 There’s also a risk of side-effects
 that would cause Akamaru to go even more berserk.
 In the event that happens…
 It’s an unavoidable measure, but Akamaru must…
 Reporting!
 The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.
 Lady Tsunade.
 That way?!
 Akamaru…
 Kiba!
 Wh-What’s that?
 It’s Akamaru…
 But…
 I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 What’re you doing?!
 Have you come to kill Akamaru?!
 No! I just came out of concern!
 You lie! The Lady Hokage said it, didn’t she?!
 There’ll be nothing else to do but to kill Akamaru.
 You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!
 I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 This isn’t the time to be doing that!
 Something called the Special Pursuit Corps or whatever is coming after Akamaru!
 What?!
 The Pursuit Corps should be here soon.
 Akamaru will really be in trouble if that happens!
 You and I have to do something before that!
 This isn’t the time to be fighting!
 Shut up!
 Why don’t you get it, Kiba?!
 Shut up!
 All right! I’ve sighted Akamaru!
 Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!
 C-Could it be…the Pursuit Corps is…
 Sis!
 You gotta be… joking, right?
 Sis!
 What’re you going to do to Akamaru with that?
 This is medicine I received from the Hokage.
 I’m going to inject it into Akamaru.
 Then Akamaru will be saved?!
 The probability is fifty-fifty.
 If it fails and side-effects are produced,
 Akamaru’s symptoms will get even worse.
 All we can do now is take a chance on this.
 If the worst happens and it fails…
 You understand, right, Kiba?
 Damn it…
 Even if it’s only fifty percent,
 there’s a possibility that Akamaru will be saved.
 We’ve gotta do this! I’ll also help out, miss!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kiba, what about you?!
 If you’re not going to do anything, you’re in the way, so beat it!
 Let’s go, Kiba.
 Just leave that coward be.
 You’re ready, right? Let’s go, Naruto!
 We’ll save you now, Akamaru!
 Aim for the legs! lmmobilize Akamaru!
 Right!
 Since it’s come to this, I have no choice.
 I must terminate Akamaru.
 Stop!
 I said stop… Akamaru.
 Kiba!
 Kiba?
 Akamaru…
 Have you forgotten…my scent?
 We were always together from when we were little, weren’t we?
 Akamaru…
 Why…why…did you become like this?
 Please remember… Akamaru!
 Kiba!
 I'm sorry, Akamaru…
 I put you through nothing but painful experiences.
 I’m sorry, Akamaru… I couldn’t protect you…
 I’m sorry… Akamaru…
 I'm a terrible master.
 But…
 I’ll…always be with you.
 Kiba…
 Kiba!
 It really would’ve been touch and go
 if the Medical Corps had been even a little late in arriving.
 Without a doubt,
 he would’ve lost his life if Akamaru’s attack had hit Kiba’s vital spot…
 Really, it could have been much worse.
 That’s wrong…
 Huh? Kiba?!
 When he came at me with his final attack,
 Akamaru just barely missed my vital spots.
 He drained all his remaining strength in order to desperately control himself.
 Akamaru was battling desperately with himself.
 That’s admirable, Akamaru!
 Thanks…
 Akamaru.
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 In this world, there remain mysteries yet unsolved.
 We came to the Hidden Leaf Village in search of mystery
 and encountered a succession of hair-raising terror.
 However, we charge forward without being daunted
 by the forest that bares its fangs.
 And then at last…!
 We witness with our own eyes,
 the creature of the legend handed down from generation to generation.

 Right here right now (Burn)
 Down a difficult road filled with endless struggles
 Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
 An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
 There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

 For a start, wake up that medium kid.
 It will release that Jutsu!
 How do we go about waking him?!
 Give him a good punch!
 But with that said…
 I’m not particularly good at transformations…
 Huh?
 So you will act as my will and make the Sign!
 Time for a combined transformation!
 We got to have fangs and claws! Let’s go!
 Transform!
 Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light
 F-Fox…?
 What a battle…
 I can’t call this place safe either, huh…
 Darn it!
 His power is increasing more and more!
 Chief! We got to hurry up and rouse that guy out of his sleep!
 I know that!
 Here goes…!
 Go to hell!
 All right! Now!
 Okay!
 Wake the hell up!
 You jerk…
 All right!
 Not that much time has passed since the medium went to sleep!
 In that state, one blow should be enough!
 Darn!
 It hasn’t been long since I emerged!
 The Jutsu has been dissolved!
 Even if the Playing Possum Jutsu is dissolved,
 he’s still putting on the pressure?
 That guy interfered with my Jutsu…?!
 Sand Coffin!
 – Pop! 					– Yeah!
 It’s the chief’s tongue…
 Don’t take me for a fool!
 Darn!
 What kind of strength does this guy possess?
 This doesn’t look good…!
 Both Naruto and I have already completely disgorged our Chakra!
 You will be killed by me! I will not cease to exist!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 Besides just the Sound Ninja, I wouldn’t have imagined that
 this many of the Sand Jonin would enter into the village, too!
 Well, it’s understandable. This is what is called war.
 It’s taking much too long.
 It’s impossible for a battle between Shinobi to last this long.
 What the heck is happening inside?
 You’re still grabbing my arm…
 I can’t use my Jutsu this way…
 Come on, let go of me once and for all.
 I’m not letting your ambitions interfere with the village…any longer…
 There’s no stopping my ambitions! You will die here!
 You old dotard…
 As the Third Hokage,
 are you saying you still have the power to save this village?
 Do you understand… the current situation?!
 Many Hidden Sand Shinobi and my subordinates
 have infiltrated this village.
 Your side…the Leaf Shinobi…
 will be annihilated down to every last woman and child!
 I will accomplish the destruction of the Hidden Leaf Village!
 It’s empty inside!
 There’s nobody there!
 That’s very strange…
 Huh?
 Why is there so little resistance when we’ve closed in
 all the way to the center of the Hidden Leaf Village?
 That’s…
 And also…there’s not one woman or child in sight.
 What is the reason for that?
 Huh?!
 Konohamaru…?
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
 I gotta use the toilet.
 M-Me too…
 I do too…
 K-Konohamaru…!
 This is an emergency situation!
 If the enemy finds us, it will cost us!
 Go back to the other room and stay quiet!
 I-It’s not that… I gotta pee!
 Hold it!
 I don’t think I can hold it…
 Gimme a break. ln that case, come along with me…
 Can't hold it!
 Can't! Can't hold…!
 That’s…
 At last, huh…
 I’ll get revenge for you no matter what…
 Hayate.
 That’s the signal. Let’s go!
 Roger!
 You don’t get it, do you, Orochimaru?
 Don’t underestimate the Shinobi of this Village!
 Are you all right?
 Yeah…
 Is that…the last?
 Yes, the evacuation is complete!
 W-What’s happening?
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves has an instruction manual
 outlining what to do in case of a sneak attack by the enemy.
 Step One: Eliminate the enemy’s sneak attack force.
 In case one is unable to eliminate them,
 proceed immediately to Step Two.
 The immediate evacuation of noncombatants!
 Evacuate the women and children to shelters around the village!
 When that has been completed, proceed to Step Three!
 Step Three…?
 Through the collective strength and efforts of the Village,
 eliminate the enemy!
 In that case…!
 The counteroffensive…starts now!
 We will not allow you to take even one step beyond this point!
 Sakura!
 Rescue Sakura, if it’s the last thing you do!
 I’ll protect Sakura no matter what!
 You will be killed by me. I will not cease to exist.
 My back is against the wall…
 I have to hurry up and stop that Demon Raccoon…
 Please…
 Just a small amount is fine…
 Give me…
 some Chakra!
 What are you doing…? There’s only one opponent!
 Hyuga is the magnum force of the Leaf Village.
 Don’t forget that!
 M-My…body…is immobilized…
 Is this the first time you’re experiencing
 the Leaf’s hidden technique, Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
 Well, take this too while I’m at it…
 The Leaf’s hidden technique… Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 W-What’s this?!
 My body is…all on its own…!
 S-Stop…
 Stop!
 Reminds me of the old days!
 Yeah!
 The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!
 Kuromaru…let’s go!
 Right!
 In order to protect the village,
 all the Leaf Shinobi will risk their lives fighting!
 Real strength doesn't lie in the mastering of all Jutsu!
 The poison in my body is…
 Don’t move, Shino. I inserted my Parasitic Insects.
 They are removing the poison.
 Dad…
 I believe I taught this to you too, in the past…
 It is when one protects someone important…
 that the true strength of the Shinobi will emerge!
 I will protect everyone!
 Here I come! You idiot raccoon!
 Die…!
 Darn…
 Darn it!
 D-Did he win…?
 A simple head blow…
 His manner of fighting is incredibly clumsy,
 but to think that he could squeeze out Chakra at that critical stage.
 I’ve never seen a knucklehead Ninja like him before, but…
 he sure is the first phenomenal kid I’ve seen in a long time.
 It’s too bad that I can’t see this through to the end,
 but I’ve reached my limit.
 Gamakichi, let’s head home!
 Okay! Pop!
 As might be expected, even I… am empty now…
 You are too, aren’t you?
 We’re much alike… let’s make this time the last!
 It appears that…
 I don’t have the strength left to yank out your entire soul.
 However, your ambition ends here!
 Not yet!
 There’s no stopping my ambition!
 I have a suitable punishment for you
 who have become addicted to the Jutsu and who have overindulged in the Jutsu!
 I will take all your Jutsu away with me!
 What did you say?!
 There!
 Don’t tell me that..?
 Stop that!
 Seal!
 My…My arms…
 Now…you can no longer use either of your arms.
 And since you can’t use your arms, you can’t weave Signs.
 You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
 Your ambition of crushing the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!
 You old dotard! Give me back my arms!
 Orochimaru, you fool…
 It’s unfortunate that we can’t leave together,
 but, my disciple…
 let’s meet in the other world one day.
 You old dotard… whose life is hanging by a thread!
 How dare you! How dare you take away my Jutsu!
 In places where the Leaf dances, a fire burns…
 The shadow of the fire will illuminate the Village…
 And once more the Leaf will sprout …
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 Lord Third Hokage…
 The ambition that you had seems to have been passed on
 to the young Shinobi in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts will burn large and strong in the future.
 And someday, they will illuminate this Village…
 just as you have done for us!

78,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Our mission this time around is a rough one.
 Can you do it, Lee?
 I’ll be okay! I can go anytime.
 Now that’s my protégé!
 Let’s go, Lee!
 Right, Guy Sensei!
 They’re off!
 Those large bags no doubt mean an overnight expedition mission.
 To think we’d encounter the ideal pair so quickly. We’re lucky.
 Then, it’s settled.
 Right. Starting operation. To infilrtra… whoa!
 H-Heavy! Get off, you idiot.
 To…infiltrate…the super elite hidden village…
 the Village Hidden in Leaves!
 The Appearance of Strange Visitors
 Wow, we look just like those two!
 Naturally. We refined our Disguise Jutsu for this very day.
 We’re after the classified information of the Leaf…
 Right!
 We’ll be famous if this goes well!
 The idea is to win distinction for our village.
 Then we’ll get tons of missions and we’ll be the village heroes!
 Village Heroes! Mondai and Poccha!
 All right. As of this moment, my name’s Guy.
 The Leaf Ninja, “Mondai Guy”!
 And I’m the protégé, “Poccha Lee”!
 Let’s go, Lee.
 Yes, Guy Sensei!
 Nothing like a large village, sure enough!
 Wow, everyone’s like a Ninja.
 Hey! Don’t be looking all about so much!
 Oww…
 Listen up.
 There’s a chief in this village called the “Hokage.”
 So there’s no doubt classified information is concentrated where that person is.
 I see.
 If I remember correctly,
 that person’s in a building easy to spot with a “Fire” mark on it or something…
 – There it is! 					– That’s it!
 What about the Lady Hokage’s house?
 – Yikes! 					– Yikes!
 Hi.
 N-Nothing special! We’re not after Leaf classified information or any-any-any…
 Are you an idiot?!
 I-It’s nothing at all!
 Is that so?
 Look, we’ve got to act naturally here.
 R-Right…
 Hi. I’m Guy.
 I’m Lee.
 Guy and Lee…, eh…?
 Don’t you guys have a different atmosphere than usual?
 No. I-It’s your imagination!
 No, I feel like something’s different…
 Oh, there’s a kite up there flying while eating a pork cutlet rice bowl!
 What? Where, where?
 What? There’s no kite anywhere.
 Hey, what?
 Jeez, that Ninja has to go and stand behind us
 without any sign of his presence.
 But it seems we fooled him good.
 Our Disguise Jutsu is perfect, sure enough.
 Say, infiltration is kind of easy, isn’t it?!
 The Leaf isn’t worth fearing!
 Guy and Lee imposters are prowling around the village?
 And to think they’d enter the village in disguises
 without even using Transformation Jutsu.
 Are they really Ninja?
 Weird people find their way in when a village grows.
 Well, it’s nonsense, but I thought I would at least report it for now.
 Indeed, we can’t just leave intruders unchecked.
 Shall we throw them out?
 No, leave them be.
 What?
 It sounds interesting, doesn’t it?
 They’re going to the trouble of calling themselves Ninja of this village.
 But…
 We probably don’t need to worry.
 It’s unlikely that anyone could be fooled by such obvious imposters.
 Come on, please. Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 Pretty please with sugar on top! Just the one day today would be fine!
 Let me join your training!
 Hey! What’s with this guy  all of a sudden?
 He’s probably a real acquaintance of theirs, but…
 Does he think we’re going to do training?!
 I’ll do anything! I’ve always been interested in Taijutsu.
 I mean…okay?! It’s okay, right?
 Anyway, let’s turn him away!
 Right!
 No. Take a pass.
 What? Why?!
 Because our training is very harsh,  rough and difficult.
 Difficult training, huh…?
 Ahhh, I’m getting even more fired up! Please!
 I won’t get in your way, no matter what! Come on.
 – Absolutely not! – Absolutely not!
 All right, since it’s come to this!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Real body clones?!
 – And furthermore… – And furthermore…
 – Harem Jutsu! – Harem Jutsu!
 Wh-What?!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 – Pl-ea-se. 					– Pl-ea-se.
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 What?!
 Yes!
 – No way. 					– No way.
 Brother, why’d you say okay?
 What’s done is done, so it can’t be helped, right?!
 Hey, Guy Sensei, Lee!
 What’s the deal, you two?
 We’re going to the farm today, right?
 Farm?
 What’re you doing letting your mind wander?
 The person’s waiting. Come on, hurry!
 – Huh? Oh… 					– H-Hey!
 Hey, wait!
 – What…? 					– Huh?
 I promised to plant rice for the sake of training?
 Not only that, all of this…
 It’s totally huge.
 Gee, thanks. It’s a big help, you guys giving me a hand.
 Please don’t worry about it.
 They accepted this on their own accord, so. Bye.
 Why is this training?
 I get it!
 Indeed, I will use my body quite a bit if I do this training.
 So I can get in shape while helping out, huh?
 Guy Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 I’ll do my best!
 Why’s he that motivated?
 Why should we have to do this manual labor…?
 Damn it. Anyway, let’s get this over with!
 You’re right.
 Th-That’s mean, brother!
 Oh, sorry about that.
 What?
 Poccha?!
 Come to think of it, there are flying leeches  in the rice fields,
 so be careful.
 F-Flying leeches?!
 Worst-case scenario, it could be deadly.
 Yikes.
 Hey Poccha!
 Hang in there!
 Just what I’d expect of Taijutsu training!
 That was some intense rice planting!
 Phew, that was a good workout!
 W-We’re done…
 Th-That was life or death…
 Then, shall we move on?
 – A manure receptacle?! – A manure receptacle?!
 Spread this in that field over there.
 Th-This is also training…?
 H-Heavy…Smelly…
 Why should I have to do something like this…?
 Hey, you guys, why don’t you walk straight?
 Y-You can walk twice the forward progress distance
 if you move ahead while  walking left and right like this!
 Oh, so that was it?
 Then I’ll also…
 Like this?
 I-It’s really hard to balance like this!
 D-Damn it!
 Gee, I didn’t realize at all that there was a method of training like this…
 Hey! Watch it. Walk more over there…
 What’d you say?
 What a nightmare.
 Forget about it. Anyway, let’s lose the kid right now.
 As for you guys, you still kind of smell bad.
 – Shut up! 					– Shut up!
 There you are, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 Oh, Sakura.
 Oh, Naruto. You’re here, too?
 As for me, I’m training together with these two today.
 R-Really?
 More importantly, is something up?
 Yeah… Actually, I really wanted your help with something, Guy Sensei, Lee.
 – What? 					– What?
 – Your laundry blew away in the wind? – Your laundry blew away in the wind?
 That’s right. lt got caught in a bit of a high spot.
 No. No way, no way. We’ve got lots of work to do, so.
 Come on!
 Here I’m asking precisely because it’s you guys.
 Please don’t say no!
 Sakura, if you’re in that much trouble, I could get it for you!
 Okay, Guy Sensei?
 Okay?!
 Sure.
 What a sheer cliff.
 That’s for sure. We’d be beyond help if we were to fall from up there.
 Right? I don’t quite have the confidence…
 That means…
 Yup! It’s right above here.
 Gee, as one would expect, I don’t think we could…
 Isn’t that great, Sakura?
 For Guy Sensei, a cliff like this is no different than a flat path.
 That’s encouraging.
 It’s a big help having an awesome Ninja like you close by, Guy Sensei.
 What? Uhh… Umm…
 Now, please.
 Brother…
 Damn it. Why is this happening?!
 I-I don’t want to die.
 D-Damn it!
 Hey, as for you guys, why aren’t you using the Chakra suction?
 Th-This is training for building up muscular strength!
 So that’s what it was?!
 Just what I’d expect of a Taijutsu user.
 I never came up with deliberately draining physical strength!
 I really do learn a lot from being with you, Sensei.
 Th-This jerk…
 I’m…I’m going to die…
 Alley-oop!
 No!
 Th-That was close…!
 Gee, sorry about that.
 This jerk…
 All right, we made it.
 Don’t look down!
 Anyway, if we can just take this back with us…
 Alley-oop…
 Damn it…
 All right, I got it.
 It won’t come loose… Hey, help me out here.
 R-Right…
 You little…!
 Sensei, use suction with your Chakra!
 This is nothing to me!
 Look out!
 For real? What?!
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 I’ve had it…
 Sensei, Bushy Brow!
 That was awesome!
 To do something like not using Chakra suction. Awesome!
 – Look you…! 					– Look you…!
 Perfect timing, you guys.
 Old Lady Tsunade.
 Actually, I’ve got something I want to ask you guys to do.
 My companion suddenly started not feeling well, you see.
 – Yikes! It’s huge! – It's huge!
 It seems she’s caught a cold.
 It’s a huge slug. Oh, as for this, is it something like Chief Toad?
 Well, that sounds about right.
 However, as you can see, we can’t carelessly move her.
 Sorry, but could you guys look after her for a while?
 I’m very sorry.
 Jeez. What a ridiculous guy.
 Brother, at this rate we won’t be able  to look for the confidential information.
 Oh, that’s right.
 Shut up.
 What’re you moaning about?
 You guys.
 It couldn’t be that you guys
 can’t listen to the words of me, the Hokage, could it?
 – This is the Hokage? – This is the Hokage?
 This is bad. To think the Hokage was that fierce a person.
 We’re taking care of her precious companion.
 We might be able to get into the Hokage estate surprisingly easily.
 I wonder.
 So even Summoning animals get sick, too…
 It seems to be a light cold.
 My nose itches, I have a sore throat and I feel weak or something…
 Hey, I’m going to chill your forehead!
 Thank you so much.
 All right, here we go.
 Oh…Oh no. The itching…
 What?!
 – Wha--! 					– What?!
 It’s… It’s melting…
 Watch it, you!
 I’m very sorry. I’ll be more caref--
 Guy Sensei! Bushy Brow!
 You’ll be in danger if you don’t move away from there!
 My…My lower back…
 Y-You idiot!
 I’m developing my dynamic vision  for narrowly evading danger!
 Wha--?
 That Sensei,
 he was training, putting his life at risk even at times like this…?
 Even though that Bushy Brow guy’s  training properly, as for me…!
 I’ve woken up, Guy Sensei, I’ll train with you!
 Let’s do this!
 Ohh, the joints in my body hurt… I feel like I’m going to fall apart…
 Hey! Aren't you a slug? What’re you doing talking about joints?!
 – S-Save us. 					– S-Save us!
 I’ve had it. What’s going on with this village…?
 I’ll die if I stay in a place like this any longer.
 Withdraw…
 Right.
 Who’re you guys?
 Why are you dressed like my protégé Lee…?
 Damn it!
 Since it’s come to this,  I don’t give a damn anymore!
 – Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack! – Super Excellent Great Hyper Attack!
 I don’t really get it, but it seems  we just have to fight, huh?
 So it seems.
 Let’s go, Lee!
 Now, knockout technique!
 – Double Dynamic Entry! – Double Dynamic Entry!
 Damn it. What did we go there for  in the end?!
 I really hate, I really hate…
 – the likes of the Leaf! – the likes of the Leaf!
 Tamaya!
 Lord knows where they came from,
 but now they’ll probably never  want to try that again.
 You sure looked like you were having fun, Lady Tsunade,
 going so far as to summon Katsuyu.
 Well, my adorable Genin helped out as well, so.
 Now, we’ve had our breather. So please be getting back to work.
 Oh yes, ma’am.
 But still… What was with that Naruto?
 To think he seriously believed those two were for real.
 What was that all about?
 Who knows…?
 Hey!
 Naruto.
 – Someone who looked just like me now… – Man, you guys got separated.
 I didn’t know what to do.
 As for me, I was impressed!
 – You guys were really cool earlier! – Huh?
 I’ve learned of the intricacies of Taijutsu or something…
 A lot happened, but I’ll continue training right away!
 Continue training?
 So come on, let’s continue the Taijutsu training!
 Moron, moron, moron.
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Damn it! Why should a Ninja have to do something like get rid of a ghost?!
 We have no choice, right? After all, a commission is a comission!
 The ghost of a feudal lord, my butt?! Th-That’s ridiculous!
 But they say it comes out at night!
 A ghost warrior clad in a white armor!
 N-No, I’m not afraid of it at all!
 H-Hey! Behind you!
 No!

79,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 His music is a Ninjutsu?
 Yeah! Awesome Chakra started bursting throughout my body.
 My power goes up like crazy!
 That’s a rare Jutsu, isn’t it?
 Shizune, have we identified the one who attacked the villagers?
 No, not yet…
 Menma. I’ve once heard of a Jutsu similar to yours.
 – What?! – Is that true, Grandma?!
 I seem to recall that the Land of Rice Paddies has a Jutsu
 that use musical instruments as the catalysts.
 Land of Rice Paddies? You mean that Land of Rice Paddies?
 Come to think of it,
 the upper part of the mountain stream where Naruto found Menma was…
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 Please allow me to go there!
 But infiltrating another land without cause is…
 No, we do have cause!
 There might be hints there about Menma’s lost memory.
 I’d also like to make that request.
 Very well.
 Excellent, Grandma! Now you’re talking!
 Thank you.
 Bringing Back Reality
 And so we’ll be heading out for a bit.
 Right, got it.
 The special pickled bamboo shoots should be ready
 by the time you guys get back.
 I can’t wait. Bye!
 Really, there’s no real need for you guys to come.
 We have no choice. It’s a mission.
 Our mission is to accompany you guys!
 Now that it’s settled…
 Let’s get to the Land of Rice Paddies!
 Right.
 – Naruto. 					– Huh?
 You stay here.
 Huh?
 What do you want, Grandma?
 If you’re any kind of sorry excuse for a Shinobi, you should know.
 What?
 I’m talking about Menma. lf that kid is a…
 No way is he a bad guy.
 I know he’s not a bad person.
 But can you state flatly that he’s not an enemy spy?
 What’re you driving at, Grandma?!
 You couldn’t have forgotten.
 The Village Hidden in Sound in the Land of Rice Paddies
 is the place where Orochimaru once hid himself.
 Well, I…
 I…remember that, but…
 Menma’s Jutsu is strikingly similar to that of the opponent Shikamaru fought
 when Sasuke was taken away.
 There’s no denying there’s a chance
 he’s affiliated with the Hidden Sound Village.
 And if he remembers something and that was to become a threat to this land…
 No way could Menma be an enemy… That just can’t be!
 We’ll leave you behind if you dawdle!
 Naruto, I’m going on ahead!
 Are you hurt?
 No… Thanks for the help.
 You were going a bit too fast.
 Let’s take a break.
 What the heck’s wrong?!
 Who in the world is he?
 We’re going to investigate because we don’t know that.
 I was running at full speed earlier.
 Losing my footing on the branch after that was on purpose, though…
 What?
 Not only did he keep up with my speed,
 but he even showed the composure to save me.
 He is better than us in terms of speed.
 He’d be a troublesome opponent if we end up fighting.
 Wha--? Hey, hey, wait a minute.
 He’s not an enemy!
 He risks his life to rescue babies.
 And he’s the kind of guy who, if left on his own,
 would help those in trouble all day!
 That’s a nice sound.
 I still hadn’t thanked you for fixing this for me.
 Don’t worry about it.
 Hey!
 Stop playing that right now!
 If you don’t…
 Neji. What’s the big idea?!
 You keep quiet!
 What?!
 It’s as Neji says.
 That might’ve been a signal to an enemy!
 A signal?
 Lady Tsunade approved this mission because the suspicious person
 who entered the village the other day still hasn’t been caught!
 If that intruder has followed Menma…
 he should be close to us now.
 No way…
 As of this point, he hasn’t shown his presence, though.
 Our mission is to accompany Naruto,
 verify his identity and to capture the intruder!
 Sorry, but I don’t trust you!
 That’s right… lt’s natural I’d be thought of like that…
 I think about this from time to time…
 What kind of a person was I?
 What would I do if I were a bad person…?
 Naruto, what kind of person would you want to be if you were reborn?
 Wh-What’s this all of a sudden?
 I’m speaking figuratively…
 I’ve never thought about it.
 I see…
 But why do you ask something like that?
 Oh, no special reason…
 What is it?
 What’s this smell?
 Now that you mention it, it smells like something’s burning.
 Over there.
 Let’s go.
 The smell came from here…
 Was there a fire or something…?
 Is something wrong?
 No…
 It’s nothing.
 Don’t move. I’ll fire if you move.
 What’s the deal all of a sudden?
 Are you their minions?
 “Their”?
 You’ll die here if you’re comrades of theirs.
 For crying out loud, who are they?!
 If you say you’re not, then show me some proof!
 Proof, why? We’re Leaf Shinobi.
 Hidden Leaf Village?
 See? Look at this.
 Indeed that is…
 What do Leaf Shinobi want in a place like this?
 Well, we just happened to be passing through and…
 As you can see, there’s nothing here.
 If you don’t have business here, just beat it.
 If you don’t, we can’t guarantee your life.
 What’s with him talking all big?!
 Here, he was the one who picked the fight.
 Once we’ve had our breather,
 let’s blow this joint and go look for Menma’s memory.
 R-Right…
 What? Did you remember something?
 No…
 Who’s there? Come on out.
 Hello.
 Y-You guys are Ninja, right?
 I heard what you were talking about earlier…
 Oh, well, I don’t want to brag, but…
 If you’re talking about Naruto Uzumaki from Hidden Leaf Village,
 I’m pretty well known.
 Really? I’m sorry, I didn’t know.
 Why did you go to the trouble of following us?
 Umm… I had a favor to ask…
 My older brother said what he did earlier, but…
 Older brother?!
 That jerk from earlier?
 We need someone to save our village!
 A person to save your village…?
 What do you mean?
 This was the border of the Land of Rice Paddies.
 But…
 as our land had caused trouble for other lands,
 this area was turned into a demilitarized zone.
 Are you talking about that thing in question…?
 It must be the incident involving Orochimaru.
 That’s how things were settled with all the neighboring lands, huh?
 But if it’s a demilitarized zone, there won’t be any territorial dispute, right?
 That’s right.
 It’s not like that.
 There’s a small mine in the hills behind the village
 and a little bit of gold can be dug up.
 Once it was discovered that mine is not being supervised by a proprietary land,
 bandits started coming with their eyes on the gold…
 No matter how often we asked the feudal lord,
 he would insist that, “Agreements between fellow lands must not be broken.”
 And the village…
 It was attacked by bandits, right?
 They withdrew in the middle of it due to a terrible storm before.
 But they’ll definitely be back.
 I beg you. Please save our village.
 You guys could fight them!
 All right! Got it…
 I’m sorry.
 We can understand the situation, but we can’t cooperate.
 Huh? What’re you saying, Neji?!
 We’re in the middle of a mission!
 We can’t act unless we have an official order from the village!
 But…
 Besides, we don’t know when the bandits will be back.
 We can’t just strand ourselves here forever!
 Damn it…
 I see…
 What’re you doing Ran, even bringing Fuki here?
 Big Brother…
 Don’t get involved with them. There’s no such thing as a good Ninja.
 Say what?!
 I just stated the truth.
 The rumor has it that the guys who attacked the village were Rogue Shinobi
 from the Hidden Sound Village.
 Huh? The bandits are Ninja?
 Come this way.
 Look at that.
 Wh-What’s this?!
 One-third of the villagers were killed in the attack the other day.
 Half of the rest abandoned the village and fled.
 Then you guys should also evacuate…
 Where are we supposed to flee?!
 This is ancestral land that’s been handed down to us
 and that we’ve cultivated.
 Why should we have to flee from that?!
 Each time the hooligans brandish their power,
 we have to accept it like a natural disaster and do nothing?!
 Are we to just flee from place to place?!
 Don’t shout, Big Brother.
 Fuki will get scared.
 I’m sorry I shouted…
 Her parents were killed by bandits and she lost her ability to speak.
 There’s no place for us to escape.
 If that’s clear, then beat it already.
 We have no choice. Let’s hurry on ahead.
 I’m staying here.
 Huh?
 I want to be of use if those people are in trouble.
 Menma!
 Hey, you don’t even know the scale of the bandits.
 If you want to help them, no matter what,
 then we should go back to the village and…
 We don’t know when they might attack.
 We don’t have the time to return to the village!
 Then, I’m staying, too!
 Naruto! Anything further than this is beyond the scope of the mission!
 This isn’t beyond the scope of the mission!
 I get the feeling I’ll be able to remember something if I stay here.
 Don’t say irresponsible things!
 You couldn’t remember anything just a moment ago…
 That’s too convenient!
 It can’t be helped, right? Menma himself is saying so.
 He’s good-natured to a fault!
 Naruto…
 Let’s go, Menma.
 Right.
 Hey, Naruto!
 We’ll deal with the bandits.
 You guys go on back to the village ahead.
 What do we do, Neji?!
 Leave them be.
 It’s unlikely the villagers will accept Naruto and Menma.
 You’ve got a point…
 It seems the settlement on the other side has escaped damage, huh?
 But how’re we supposed to protect the village just the two of us…?
 Let’s build a wall along this creek. This river will play the role of a moat.
 Ultimately we’ll make a temporary bridge
 and have the entrance to the village in just one location.
 I get it…
 I don’t know how effective it’ll be,
 but let’s just do the best we can now.
 Right.
 What’re you doing? I told you to get out.
 We won’t get out!
 What did you say?!
 We decided to protect the village on our own.
 Nobody asked you to do that. lt’s none of your business!
 You may say that,
 but you can’t beat them off by just hiding in your houses!
 All right, let’s stabilize it with a stake.
 Got it…
 Jeez, what can they do just the two of them?!
 I’m ready…
 Okay.
 Tenten! You’re still here?!
 Can’t you at least say thanks first?
 Thanks, Tenten.
 Come on, Naruto. Hold it down right.
 R-Right…
 You are…
 For me?
 Then I’ll help myself.
 Have this, too.
 I’ll help out, too.
 You’re mine!
 Not yet!
 That technique!
 It’s from that time!
 Neji! You…
 It’s our mission this time around to catch this guy.
 Heh! This guy’s formidable.
 Damn it!
 He’s quick to escape!
 Naruto!
 The sound waves pierced my whole Chakra Network all at once
 and amplified the flow of Chakra?
 I won’t lose to the likes of this guy if I have this Jutsu!
 This is to avenge everyone.
 Eat this!
 You’re in my way!
 Menma!
 Menma! Menma!
 Carry him to the village.
 Manma! Hang in there!
 Boiling water and alcohol!
 All right.
 Are you going to treat him?
 I may not look it, but I’ve played at being a doctor.
 We’ll save you now, Menma.
 What’s the matter?
 I cannot treat this guy…
 Wh-Why not?!
 This mark…
 He’s a comrade of a guy who attacked here…!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Menma is not a member of the bandits.
 I mean, he loves helping people!
 He’s a type of guy who would even risk his own life in order to save a kid!
 For this village too,
 he has worked hard, so hard, even though no one really asked for it.
 He’s got to have some kind of reason.
 So please save Menma!

 The winner is Temari.
 Oh, I’m tired…
 Oh, what a waste!
 Why?! He had a chance to become a Chunin!
 Shikamaru is Shikamaru…
 Really… Does he or doesn't he have the motivation?
 Even I’m not sure about it.
 But his intelligence and strategies are no longer at the Genin level.
 If it had been an actual mission for a basic platoon,
 the win was decided when he captured Temari…
 So, I suppose he won the competition, but he lost the match…
 It’s unfortunate he shows no signs of being motivated,
 on the other hand, he won’t get too emotional or fall into a panic.
 And that’s exactly why…
 he’d be able to calmly pull back if he viewed a situation as totally hopeless.
 That could be attributed to calm judgment.
 Shikamaru probably possesses…
 the most important psychological element required for a Chunin…
 the disposition of a leader!
 In order to evaluate someone as a leader of a platoon…
 it’s much more important to protect the platoon from danger,
 than to carry out a mission.
 Yeah…it’d hardly be worth mentioning a completed mission
 if everyone was annihilated.
 The risks and the mission should be put on a scale,
 surviving should be thought of first, and then action should be taken.
 A person who can’t do this isn’t qualified to become a Chunin.
 Hyuga and Naruto from earlier fail on that point.
 Although they are all right as insignificant Genin.
 Well, I do feel like Shikamaru gave up too soon too.
 What do you think?
 What do I feel…?
 He has more of a chance than Naruto, for sure!
 Shoot…!
 Why the heck did he give up!
 Is he an idiot?!
 This ticks me off!
 I’m gonna really give him a lecture!
 So the one that’s gonna become a Chunin is…
 You idiot!
 Shut up, super idiot!
 Why the heck did you give up?!
 Let’s not talk about that anymore, all right?
 It’s not all right! It was a match you were close to winning!
 – Let's just watch the next match. – But you just gave up! Unimaginable!
 Simply unimaginable!
 Huh? The next match?
 Sasuke…!
 ""Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand""
 At last, Uchiha’s match is next.
 Oh, but who’s this opponent Gaara?
 I wonder…
 But compared to Uchiha, he’s nothing much.
 Do you know?
 I hear Uchiha’s gonna withdraw from this match.
 Really?!
 Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious injury while training before the match…
 Are you serious?
 And to think I took time off specifically to see this match!
 I’m counting on you, come on!
 As you’d expect, this match will be won by Uchiha.
 No way, I’ve got high hope for the new one of the Sand.
 He won’t let this one slip by.
 As they say about the world of competition…
 It’s impossible to predict what will occur…
 Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,
 he has not yet arrived at the arena.
 Umm…it’s unavoidable…
 We can’t make the guests wait any longer.
 Another ten minutes.
 Why don’t we wait just another ten minutes?
 But…
 The guests are looking forward to the next match above all else.
 Cancelling it would be cruel.
 Since it’s come to this, waiting another ten minutes wouldn’t hurt.
 Lord Hokage…?
 Umm…
 Uchiha, where are you!
 What's keeping you? Hurry up!
 There is some truth to what Kazekage says.
 So shall we extend it for ten minutes from now.
 So…let Genma know of this.
 Yes!
 If it stays like this, Uchiha will really be forced to withdraw.
 I see…a ten-minute extension…
 Sasuke…
 Hey, isn’t that…
 Y-You are…
 But, what’s that idiot doing! He’s still not here?!
 Sasuke…!
 Please!
 Good of the two of you to make it!
 Come now, hurry into the arena!
 Yeah!
 All right! Here we go!
 Oh! Yeah!
 Most of the first round is finished,
 and the only one left is Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.
 H-How about Naruto and Neji’s match…?!
 Well, the interesting thing is…
 That Hyuga lost…
 Naruto beat Neji…
 I see…
 You did it!
 Naruto!
 You’re such a… good guy really…
 – What’s going on with the next match! – Let's get on with it!
 Isn’t Uchiha up yet?!
 We want Uchiha! Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 Hey, it’s almost time.
 Is he really gonna come?!
 He’ll come…
 He’ll definitely come!
 Oh Sasuke, what’s he doing!
 What the heck is Uchiha doing?!
 It seems the rumor that he’d had a serious injury was true.
 If there’s a win by default, then this match is mine.
 Thirty more seconds…
 Uchiha!
 Uchiha!
 Sasuke…please come!
 Sasuke!
 Hurry up and come!
 It won’t be good if it stays this way!
 The time limit is up.
 So this is it.
 Because the time limit has expired, the last match…
 See… Here he is…
 Well, I’m sorry we’re late…
 Sasu…
 Your name?
 Sasuke…Uchiha.
 Sasuke…Uchiha.
 Sasuke!
 It looks like he made it in time.
 Lee!
 Darn… Causing others this much trouble…
 and thinking himself so important!
 Huh! You’re pretty late!
 I thought you weren’t coming ‘cause you were scared to take me on!
 Who the heck was it that said he’d come for sure?
 The first round…did you win?
 Of course!
 Don’t get too carried away…
 Loser!
 Well, I know it’s somewhat rude to be showing up all flashy like this…
 but was Sasuke…
 disqualified?
 So your habit of tardiness rubbed off on him? Cripes…
 And…what about it?
 It’s all right, Sasuke’s match has been postponed anyway.
 Your arrival was barely in time, but…
 he hasn’t been disqualified.
 That’s good to hear!
 Don’t lose to a guy like that!
 Yeah…
 I want to fight you too…
 Sasuke!
 I want…to fight you too!
 Yeah…
 Yay, Sasuke!
 Uchiha's match is gonna start!
 Shikamaru gave it so much, but already it’s Sasuke…
 Poor Shikamaru…
 Hey, is that Uchiha?
 I‘m just second fiddle…
 Well, I guess that’s just the way it goes…
 I’m looking forward to it too.
 Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.
 What is?
 Well, Naruto did beat that Neji Hyuga and…
 Sasuke is an elite member of the Uchiha…
 and it seems like everyone’s anxious to see Sasuke’s match.
 Sasuke will face that Gaara of the Sand whom I couldn’t beat…
 And Naruto beat that Neji that I had hoped to take down.
 Why is it so…
 Why am I so…
 frustrated!
 Lee…!
 At last…
 Gaara, come down here!
 Naruto! Let’s go up!
 Yeah!
 When we go up, we’ll leisurely take the stairs.
 What’s up with you!
 Are you still upset that I pushed you down?!
 T-This isn’t good…
 It’s been quite awhile since I’ve seen Gaara like this.
 H-Hey…Gaara.
 Keep the strategy in mind--!
 Don’t talk to Gaara right now!
 You’ll be killed.
 Right!
 Let’s go!
 Hey, hurry up!
 Nothing good’s gonna happen in your life if you panic.
 What’s wrong?
 Huh?
 Low-level tournaments like this Chunin Examination are ideal
 as gambling matches.
 A number of feudal lords are here for that purpose.
 So…would you lose this match for us.
 Hey, come on, at least give us an answer.
 Too scared to say anything…
 H-Help!
 S-Stop! Stop!
 If those two in front of us hadn’t been there,
 we probably would’ve been killed…
 This is the first I’ve seen anyone kill people without hesitation like that…
 This isn’t looking good even for Sasuke.
 Sasuke…

 Yeah… Most of the Leaf Village people here are surprised.

 will open the lid of its basket with its own beak.

 It’s okay, there’s no damage to his internal organs.

 I’m sorry but… Could you step out for a moment?
 B-But…
 It won’t take long.
 Y-Yes.
 What do you need from me?
 That day…
 I came to tell you the truth… about that day.
 That day…?
 At that time, I intended to die!
 W-What are you talking about?!
 That day my father…
 He was killed as your body double!
 The truth of that day…is here.
 They're probably only excuses made at the convenience of the head family.
 The person you are now… should be able to understand.
 This writing…!
 Neji… I only have a little time left.
 I want to use that limited time to convey something to you…
 Convey something to me?
 The head of Ninjas from the Land of Lightning,
 who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata, was killed by Lord Hiashi…
 But the Land of Lightning didn’t acknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,
 made only the killing of the head Ninja a problem,
 and made unreasonable demands.
 It can’t be helped.
 With my one life, the village can be saved…
 Wait, Hiashi. Don’t be so hasty!
 The Hyuga’s Kekkei Genkai is an important strength of this land.
 It is the duty of the head family to protect it forever…
 However, for the sake of that duty…
 if we involve our land in a desperate war…!
 I understand that! That’s why…
 Isn’t that why we have branch families?
 Hizashi’s corpse… We’ll hand it over as your body double.
 Hizashi too… understands the situation.
 However, what they want is the secret of the power of the Byakugan.
 The point in time that Hizashi becomes a corpse,
 that power will be sealed.
 I don’t believe that the Land of Lightning will consent to that.
 That’s their true intent,
 but the condition made by Lightning is to “Hand over Hiashi Hyuga’s dead body.”
 We pretend that we agreed to their terms,
 and hand Hizashi, who is identical to you, over...
 and they can’t pursue it any further than that.
 B-But…
 Hiashi… The time has come…
 Your predecessors have done the same to protect the power of Hyuga clan.
 Even siblings… have the heart to write each other off.
 That is the fate of the head family.
 And this…is the destiny of ones born into Hyuga!
 Where has Lord Hiashi, who is always bullish, go?
 The scale of this issue is different from the ones in the past!
 It’s not that easy…
 H-Hizashi…you…
 Please…let me go.
 You… You…have Neji.
 Why do you choose death… for the head family?!
 That’s not so!
 I have been resenting the head family.
 To tell the truth even now I’m bitter.
 That’s why…
 I want to die protecting you as “my brother,” not as the head family.
 It’s the first time I’ve had the freedom to choose.
 I’ve only shown Neji my ugly side.
 However, now I’ve come here and finally know my own intentions.
 So please tell Neji…
 I-I wasn’t killed to protect the head family…
 but to protect my siblings, family and the land…
 by my own will I chose death!
 T-To choose death… you call that freedom…?
 Big brother…
 Once, just this once, I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.
 I wanted to choose my own fate.
 That’s all.
 Overcome your own fate, Neji…
 Fate is something you work out with your own hands.
 Father…
 This is…the truth!
 I’m sorry!
 Please…raise your head.
 Father…
 I wonder if a person’s destiny is only floating like a cloud in a fixed current…
 Or is a person able to ride on the current that he chooses.
 I don’t understand it well yet.
 Whichever, the end point might still be the same…
 Just, when the choice is the latter…
 people turn toward the goal of living and work hard toward it.
 And those who hold that are really strong.
 I feel like I finally understand, through this battle…
 And… father…
 I have only one goal…
 I want to become stronger, so I won’t lose to anyone.
 That’s how I feel now.
 Father…I see many birds flying. And they seem to be enjoying themselves.
 It’s buzzing.
 That’s because it was a good battle…
 Certainly, there’s that too, but…
 It’s likely that, for the curious heads of Ninja and the feudal lords,
 there is no match they look forward to more than this next match.
 By the way, it seems that he wasn’t seen at the opening ceremony…
 He’s arrived here already, hasn’t he?
 There’s been no news of Sasuke.
 And there’s the issue of Orochimaru.
 Before everyone starts to make noise, we should disqualify him…
 What’s going on?! Hurry up and start the next match!
 How long are you going to make us wait!
 Before night falls!
 I wonder what’s going on with the next match?
 Is Sasuke here?
 Sasuke…
 That guy… What in the world is he doing?!
 Is he planning not to show up?
 A wise man never courts danger…
 A wise judgement…is it?
 What are you saying?
 He’ll definitely come! Believe it!
 But seriously, what is he doing?
 Keep this up and he… he’ll be disqualified.
 There’s no choice…
 Sasuke is…disqualified.
 Yes.
 Sasuke Uchiha is…disqualified?
 It has to be done.
 What in the world are we going to do?
 If that guy doesn’t show up, our plan of strategy…
 This isn’t good…
 Could he have…?
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 I’m going to confirm my existence…
 Darn that Gaara…
 I wonder if he really killed him…
 Sasuke one more time…
 What happened?
 It’s obvious that you’re there standing with the thirst for blood.
 Why don’t you come out?
 It’s you…
 Lord Hokage…
 I want you to consider waiting a little bit for Sasuke Uchiha’s disqualification.
 I understand your point, but…
 No matter how excellent the Shinobi,
 to make light of time is not a qualification for Chunin.
 If there’s no clear reason to satisfy
 the heads of Ninja and feudal lords who are here,
 there’s no reason to wait for him!
 I see…
 Well then, there is a sufficient reason.
 Including myself…
 most of the heads of Ninja and feudal lords that are here…
 came here because they want to see the next match.
 However…
 He’s the remaining survivor of the “Uchiha.”
 Land of the Wind too, absolutely, is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.
 Lord Hokage…
 There’s no guarantee that Sasuke will come but…
 All right then…
 We shall specially postpone this match and wait.
 Lord Hokage! Really…
 Inform so to the Proctor!
 Y-Yes.
 However…
 It’s rare for you to insist like that, Lord Kazekage.
 Well…
 To show off the Shinobi’s qualities of our village to the feudal lords…
 there’s no better opponent than an Uchiha.
 It’s a chance for us as well.
 C’mon, what happened to the match?!
 What happened to Uchiha?!
 I understand…
 Everyone! The candidate for the next battle has not arrived here!
 We’ll briefly postpone this battle and start the following battle ahead of it.
 What is he doing…that Sasuke?
 Great, so Sasuke didn’t get disqualified!
 That’s good…
 Hey! That means my match is one match closer!
 Then, on to the next pair!
 Kankuro and Shino Aburame! Come down!
 My match…doesn’t matter at all.
 More importantly…
 I'd rather not expose the Mechanism of Crow to the enemy before the plan…
 Proctor!
 I abstain!
 What?!
 I abstain! Please advance the matches!
 Due to Kankuro’s abstention, Shino Aburame wins by default!
 What’s that all about?!
 Have a proper match!
 You are…?
 It’s my turn, isn’t it?
 It seems that you’re really fired up.
 Okay, let’s go to the next match.
 Hey! The last one, come down!
 Hey! Hey! What are you doing, frivolously building things up?
 I mean, why does only my match have to be modified?
 Shikamaru Nara! You!
 Damn… lf it’s like this I’ll abstain too…
 C’mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!
 Damn that Naruto…
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Go! Shikamaru!
 It looks a bit strange that Shikamaru is fighting in the Final Round.
 He's good, firing up, burning up! That's my teammate!
 But, doesn't he seem spaced out looking at the sky?
 He totally looks so ambitious. All right, Shikamar!
 Keep it up and 					attack hard!
 Nex time, ""Zero Motivation: The Guy with Cloud Envy!""
 Ino, your cheering is kinda scary.

82,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Sand Coffin!
 I’ll do it.
 No! Please back me up.
 I got sand in my mouth…
 P-Please let me go!
 You wouldn’t be able to do anything in your current state…
 I’ll do it.
 Please be careful!
 That guy attacks with bones!
 Like earlier…
 he does things like shoot bones and extrude bones from inside his body…
 He controls bones freely!
 Gaara of the Desert…
 You use sand, as the name implies, huh…?
 Gaara vs. Kimimaro
 Tough defense using sand…
 He…isn’t a close-range combat type…
 Getting close would be difficult, huh.
 It's coming!
 Digital Shrapnel!
 There’s no waste in his movements…
 Sure enough, he’s a considerable Taijutsu user.
 Attack and defense are one…
 He attacks and defends with sand, huh?
 However, the amount of sand he can control is probably…
 …about the amount of sand inside the gourd.
 Gaara of the Desert… A dopey nickname.
 You can’t do anything if you don’t have sand.
 Going to the trouble of walking around carrying heavy sand
 is the very proof of that.
 Sand Shower…
 How trite…
 As long as I have sand, I can do anything.
 You’re the one who’s dopey…
 It’s easy for me to do things like create sand with dirt…
 I get it…
 With his own sand he grinds things like rocks and minerals in dirt
 and makes it into sand.
 So he was sending his own sand beneath the ground
 and adding new sand, huh…?
 Gaara of the Desert…
 His nickname isn’t just for display.
 Excellent!
 You did it!
 Not yet.
 Sand Burial!
 I’m reminded of that man when I look at that guy.
 Huh?
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 He had the same eyes as that guy…
 The same eyes?
 Wanting to verify the value of one’s own existence…
 Such eyes…
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke.
 You’re here, aren’t you?! At least answer me!
 What’s gotten into you?!
 I don’t hate the darkness…
 The darkness is where I was brought up…
 Why am I…in a place like this?
 Did I do something wrong?
 Is there really God…?
 If there is, why confine me in a place like this?
 Who’s there?
 It doesn’t matter who I am… Get out!
 Kimimaro, the time has come to use you…
 Huh?
 For our sake, for the Kaguya Clan…
 Fight!
 Yes… To fight.
 That is…
 the only thing I can do now.
 N-No way…
 That’s quite some pressure…
 I would’ve been flattened just like that
 had I not made a membrane of bone just below the skin.
 Bones…That guy’s a monster, too.
 It’s a troublesome body, isn’t it?
 I underestimated you…
 But, I won’t be caught by your sand anymore.
 Sand Tsunami!
 Wow… It’s beyond the scope of
 escaping from the sand or not getting caught…
 To think it would change the terrain itself…
 You…You did it.
 Not yet.
 Giant Sand Burial!
 H-He’s so strong…
 He’s gotten even stronger than when he fought me.
 But…this time for sure…
 He’s a persistent guy…
 Huh?!
 I’m still…alive…
 Then… There’s still significance for me to live.
 From now, we’re going to launch a night attack
 on the Hidden Mist Village…
 As they are disconcerted from that incident,
 now is the perfect time for us to make them realize our ferocity!
 Make them realize the ferocity of the Kaguya Clan!
 – Yeah! 					– Right!
 What’re you doing, Kimimaro? Get going!
 I don’t know what to do…
 You don’t need to think deeply about it.
 Go down to the Hidden Mist Village
 and kill every last person you encounter!
 Just act on your instincts!
 Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?
 No…
 I-I see… Excuse me!
 Haku?
 Oh…no. It’s nothing, Zabuza.
 We don’t have time to be stopping. Let’s hurry!
 Right!
 He had the same eyes as I…
 Before I met Zabuza…
 Hold it!
 You’re a hasty one, aren’t you? I’m not from this village.
 The thing you are after is right there…
 Now, go.
 It seems to have begun…
 The Kaguya Clan…
 Fools who can only find their own path of life by fighting…
 It was long ago
 when a simple-minded group that just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.
 With a governed organization as an opponent,
 they just become fools rushing towards death
 if they fight only with power…
 Are we the only survivors…?
 It seems we’re surrounded…
 The defense was tighter than we thought.
 We have no choice…
 Now it’s come to this,
 take along with you every person you can!
 We’ll have them entertain us as much as possible!
 What do I fight for…?
 What am I…?
 Without knowing anything, I just kept on fighting.
 The time has come to use you…
 I’m needed…
 That was the only thing that got my body moving.
 And…
 I was also able to figure out that…
 I couldn’t live if I didn’t fight.
 Dawn broke…
 And I learned that…
 I myself was the only one to survive.
 Again, I’m all alone…
 By myself, I just wandered aimlessly from place to place.
 This is…
 The flower, from back then…?
 Why are you blooming in a place like this?
 Why won’t you answer?
 You’re ignoring me, too, huh?!
 There’s no way you’d be seen by someone in a place like this, yet you…!
 That’s enough…
 Maybe…there’s no significance to living.
 But you might be able to discover something interesting
 by continuing to live…right?
 Like how you discovered that flower…
 Like how I discovered you.
 Okay, Let’s go…
 Back then… Lord Orochimaru said that, but…
 People are born with some kind of significance.
 That’s what I think… some kind of important mission.
 The mission for me…
 is to protect Lord Orochimaru and his ambition.
 What’s…that?!
 Come back, Sasuke! Everyone’s worried about you!
 Damn it… lt’s so dark I can’t see anything!
 You’ve got better eyes than me.
 Sasuke is in the darkness now…
 N-Neji?!
 You’ll be unable to catch up with Sasuke
 if you stop in a place like this…
 Neji!
 Yeah… You’re right! This isn’t the time to stop.
 Just wait! I’ll take Sasuke back home no matter what!
 Sasuke!
 Sand Coffin!
 That form…?!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 I’m saved. That’s excellent.
 To think you could do such a thing!
 He was persistent, but this is the end… 184.01	01:47:58:14	01:48:00:16	He’ll never come out again.
 Brainwashed by Orochimaru…
 It’s not brainwashing! That person understands me!
 What do you guys know?!

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?

 Remembrance:  The Lost Page
 All right! I’m up for it today again, believe it!
 However… There haven’t been any flashy missions around here lately.
 C’mon! It’s unbelievable, right?!
 Yeah well…
 Lately, I’m dead tired from doing nothing but training.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 There’s someone who got too much time on his hands!
 What’s that?! Speak for yourself.
 No matter how I look at it, you are just helping the shop.
 What happened to Shikamaru and Choji?
 On a mission with Asuma Sensei!
 Oh, I wanted to go on a mission too!
 While Ino was down with a cold, everyone went on urgent missions.
 And now I’m completely recovered!
 What am I going to do with all my fighting spirit?
 Why don’t you use that fighting spirit in some training?
 That’s what you think!
 In my family, if you don’t have a training partner,
 then they make up some reason for you to help out with the shop!
 They must know that if you’re alone you’ll skip training, eh?
 H-Hey! Don't say something that could hurt a person’s reputation!
 I do it properly by myself.
 Naruto…
 Stop it, Shino! Don’t surprise me!
 Naruto Uzumaki… Yamanaka Ino…
 The Hokage is asking for both of you.
 What? Me too?
 By the way, I’ve also been ordered to go, along with you guys.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Ino… me and Shino?
 Huh?
 Demon of Ocean causing disturbance…?
 Yes, literally a demon in the ocean.
 It seems to be the cause of the disturbance happening in the remote Land of Sea…
 What’s wrong…?
 You’ll go for me, won’t you?
 Of course.
 Shizune…
 Y-Yes!
 Explain…
 Y-Yes!
 As you can see,
 the Land of Sea is made up of a group of islands of various sizes.
 Recently in that area, their only means of transportation, ships,
 are being attacked and robbed of money and valuables.
 The people on the boat who were victimized
 unanimously claim that the damage was done by the “Demon of the Ocean.”
 And exterminating this Demon of the Ocean is the mission?
 Well… more or less, yes. But there’s more.
 The Land of Sea does not have a hidden village of its own,
 so they’re prepared for contingencies
 through military cooperation with the neighboring country, the Land of Water,
 and have been paying them a retainer every month…
 However, the other day, one of their ships that collects funds
 was attacked by the Demon of the Ocean as well…
 I see. To preserve their relationship with Land of Water,
 Land of Sea will do anything to protect the next ship.
 Yes… This mission is to guard the ships collecting funds
 and destroy the Demon of the Ocean…
 I’ve got a few people to work under you, so I’m counting on you.
 Work under me… ?
 Enter!
 Huh?
 The Chunin Exam’s…
 Th-That scary proctor!
 Oh, you’re bringing back memories..!
 A-Anko Mitarashi Sensei?
 Why are you here?
 – Everyone! 					– Yes!
 I’m pronouncing your mission!
 Shino Aburame! lno Yamanaka!
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 The three of you will work under Anko and accompany her on a mission!
 What?! These members?
 The team is pretty disjointed, isn’t it?!
 No use talking about it!
 Listen... I’ve thought through the matter and
 I believe that this combination is
 the most qualified for this mission…
 All of you display your own capabilities to the full extent and execute this mission!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 She just gathered the available Genin… Really, she is such a…
 Still, something doesn’t feel quite right…
 Yeah, yeah, no complaints about a mission that’s settled!
 Ouuch… I got it!
 Okay, we’ll depart right away!
 Everyone prepare and assemble at the front gate!
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 Oh, ouch!
 Anko…
 Be careful…
 Yes…
 Characteristics of the Demon of the Ocean...
 It’s like a fish, like a person... What is this?!
 Huh, someone’s eyes are playing tricks. Something like that can’t exist!
 Not true, it’s possible that Ex-Ninja become pirates
 and use Transformation and Genjutsu.
 Well, whatever, if we don’t gather information, there will be no solution.
 Right…
 Mother Island is the biggest island at the center of Land of Sea…
 We’ll go to a nearby fishing port and cross over by boat!
 – I understand! – I understand!
 Yeah! Let’s depart for the Land of Sea!
 This guy is always hyper…
 I'm anxious about what’s going to happen.
 Here you are…
 Um… Lady Tsunade…
 Hmm?
 It’s about…Anko Mitarashi just now…
 Did, uh… Did something happen in the past?
 Sort of…
 Oh? This is…
 Her record of missions from about the age of ten is pretty sporadic.
 Because Anko was under Orochimaru...
 So the parts that are blacked out
 are combined with Orochimaru’s movements…
 and in the confidential file?
 Part of them are…
 Huh?
 There are some parts that aren’t recorded…
 That’s the truth.
 No record?! Even though Anko herself was in the village?
 That Orochimaru…
 It seems he really didn’t want to be traced…
 When he left the village…
 He erased part of Anko’s memories.
 The wind is salty…
 Coming this far, we can already see over the Land of Sea.
 Then, that must be the Mother Island?
 What ? What is this feeling?
 Everyone… Sorry but…
 Go ahead and take care of the arrangements for the boat.
 What? But, what would you do, Sensei?
 I’ll take care of some business and join you… See you!
 Oh! Sensei?!
 C’mon, it can’t be helped…
 What are you doing, Shino?
 We’ll leave you behind!
 Yeah…
 The Curse Mark aches.
 This presence… No question about it.
 This way?
 I can say their names without a problem!
 Um… That’s Mother Island…
 These are Taro Island and Jiro island.
 And… That there’s Demon Island!
 Seems you prepared before you came…
 I want to become a wiser, stronger Shinobi like you, Master Orochimaru…
 Oh…?
 Here.
 Sorry, but I can’t give you anything more than this.
 What’s up…lno?
 Hey, mister!
 Aren’t you bringing prices down way too much?
 That’s high-quality fish, isn’t it?
 Oh dear…
 I’m not price-cutting…
 See...
 Because of that  ""Demon of the Ocean""  uproar,
 customers are completely staying away...
 This is the market price around here.
 Really? That fish is rarely… Oh!
 What’s with her appearance? ls she injured or something?
 No… That girl, she has her reasons.
 Well…
 She’s a female diver from a small town on the cape of Mother Island…
 What?!
 Why would a woman diver on Mother Island transfer islands on purpose?
 That’s because, the island people didn’t want to do business with her…
 That girl…
 In the past, she was spirited away…
 Spirited away…?
 A person suddenly disappears… is that it?
 That’s right!
 In the past,
 a lot of island people disappeared from being spirited away.
 The story is that out of all those people
 that girl was the only one who suddenly returned one day.
 Hey, hey!
 It’s a little village…
 So everyone felt creepy.
 They say that now, she lives alone outside of the village…
 I see… I feel sorry for her.
 With her appearance... And then you hear things, I too...
 feel a little bit creepy…
 That's true.
 Hey, where’s Naruto?
 I don’t know…
 Hey! What are you guys doing?!
 Oh no!
 Hey, are you okay?
 Yes…
 You’re uh… You’re from a place called Mother Island, aren’t you?
 Hm?
 Uh… Nothing…
 Ninja…
 Oh, I’ll help!
 That’s okay…
 Huh…? H-Hey… Wait.
 What the…?
 It’s too bad but, the last boat from the port has already left.
 But the sun hasn’t even set yet…
 Around here, there’s nobody who will take you across in the early evening...
 Sorry, but come back tomorrow.
 No way…
 Well, is there a way to get to Mother Island besides the ferry?
 Mmm, I can’t really advise it, but…
 If it’s necessary, I’ll let you borrow my little boat.
 Hey! I was looking all over for you guys!
 C’mon! Where were you?!
 Sorry, sorry…
 You should at least say something before you disappear.
 You and Sensei are exactly alike, suddenly going someplace.
 Feels like there’ll be a bumpy road ahead.
 What?! That’s rude.
 Placing me in the same category together with that unreasonable sensei--!
 Who’s what?
 S-Sorry.
 This sensei… is dangerous, after all…
 Good work procuring the boat!
 S-Sensei… Where in the world have you been all this time?
 Oh, something like gathering information…
 Well, let’s go!
 The Shinobi of Leaf Village are here…
 Land of Sea must have pleaded with them
 to investigate on the “Demon of the Ocean.”
 Well then, we should give them the best welcome.
 It’s getting dark…
 We’re almost to Mother Island.
 All right, all right!
 Full speed advance to Mother Island!
 Although the sun has already set ...
 Where does all your hyper-energy come from?!
 Times like this, your state of mind is important!
 Sakura sure has her share of trouble… I feel sorry for her.
 What the…! I ran up against a rock or something!
 Hang in there, Naruto!
 Hey, all of you look forward, front!
 Dodge it, quick!
 You say that, but…
 It’s no good, the oar won’t move!
 I’ll help!
 You…!
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 Naruto! Leave it!
 I understand!
 To show themself so soon…
 That was close…
 The two of you be careful! He’s aiming at us from underwater!
 Dammit!
 Demon of the Ocean or whatever,
 an underwater creature for an underwater battle!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I’m counting on you… Chief Toad!
 What?!
 Hey! Naruto! What kind of place did you call me to?!
 Why did you come out! You stupid frog!
 Oh! Hey, wait!
 Summoning Jutsu.
 Please come out, Chief Toad!
 Hey, good evening!
 It can't be! I have been calling for Chief Toad!
 Stupid! If you summoned the old man to a place like this,
 terrible things would happen.
 Huh? Why?
 We’re freshwater creatures! We don’t go with saltwater!
 I don’t like salty things either.
 You’re no help at all!
 Shino! Take care of Ino…
 Okay!
 All right!
 Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu!
 Water Clone?!
 You let your guard down!
 You did too!
 Take that!
 There was one more?!
 What the…? My body strength is…!
 How is it? My improved skill of Chakra Suction?
 What’s happening?!
 Where did he go? Damn it!
 My visibility is too bad…
 Hey, pull yourself together, Naruto!
 Big Brother, it itches.
 Ah, I’m at my limit, too…
 B-Big Brother!
 This is not so good.
 Naruto!
 What happened?
 You two are?!
 I’ll discharge all the Chakra I absorbed at once…
 Water Style: Furious Current Jutsu!
 Shoot! I can’t approach them so easily with this.
 Naruto…
 I can’t stand this!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 To think the departure of the collection ship
 would be moved up at the time like this.
 It can’t be helped.
 We’ve got to find Naruto somehow by tomorrow morning.
 I hope we pick up some information about the Demon of the Ocean along the way.
 The search range is quite expansive, huh?
 It’d be best to split up.
 Then I’ll go from the south, you guys take the north.
 – Roger! 					– Roger!
 Think about what happened yesterday.

84,"Summoning Jutsu!
 Oh, long time no see.
 We don’t have much time to get nostalgic.
 We’ve got a mission.
 That I see over there is the Village of Artisans, isn’t it?
 Yeah. It’s a village of professionals who develop Ninja tools.
 The exceptional Ninja tools they develop are also
 supplied to us in the Five Great Nations…
 But there’s been a strange rumor recently.
 A strange rumor?
 Something about them developing the ultimate weapon
 and attempting to antagonize the Five Great Nations.
 In other words, we should search the village and…
 verify whether or not there is that ultimate weapon, right?
 That’s about the size of it.
 Piece of cake.
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Hey! Something strange is going on.
 What is it?!
 There’s not a soul in the village!
 I also found something terrible on top of that.
 What?!
 It’s that.
 The coffin of Seimei, the founder of the Village of Artisans.
 Even his body is…
 This is serious.
 The artisans abandoned their village. Where in the world did they go?
 The Targeted Shukaku
 I’m hungry, I’m hungry!
 Maybe I’ll treat myself and have two eggs in my ramen today.
 Huh?
 What’s going on there?!
 Did I keep you waiting by any chance?
 Not really. I just got here a bit before.
 That’s good… Then, here.
 I made sure to hand it to you.
 Yeah, yeah. What a pain.
 Just a minute!
 What’re you guys doing…
 all in secret in a place like this without even asking me?!
 –Naruto? 					–Huh?
 You’re terrible, just terrible, Sakura!
 Here you won’t even go out on a date with me at all!
 Why're you talking gibberish all of a sudden?
 Ouch-ouch-ouch-ouch…
 An errand for the Old Lady?
 Yes. It seems a new poison was discovered or something.
 I delivered a list of research medicinal substance
 for Shikamaru’s father to prepare.
 Oh, that’s it?!
 Jeez, you jump to conclusions.
 Oh, come to think of it,
 an update report from Temari has been delivered to Lady Tsunade.
 An update report?
 So? What exactly?
 I heard that the Village Hidden in the Sand started Ninja education,
 imitating the curriculum program of the Leaf’s.
 It seems that Temari and her brothers are working as instructors.
 Instructors?!
 Is that harsh woman fit to be something like an instructor…?
 Really? That Gaara, huh…?
 This is hands-on training.
 Choose from among these a Ninja tool that suits you.
 What is it?
 Do we absolutely have to choose?!
 What do you mean?
 We’ll end up hurting the other person if we use a weapon.
 We might kill them.
 A weapon is…
 No, never mind…
 A mission isn’t a game.
 If you were to enter a field of battle with that frame of mind, you'd die.
 I-I’m sorry.
 You got Gaara angry because you ask stupid questions.
 You are in trouble.
 The three of us will conduct hands-on training.
 Gather in the respective class of your choice.
 Gaara, put a smile on!
 They'll get scared and nobody will choose you with that sulky look.
 My dad said that Gaara was the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
 Yeah. He's so powerful that the village would be destroyed, if he got mad.
 He’s scary, so let’s not bother.
 All right, I’m with Temari.
 I’ll be with Kankuro!
 – Me too! 					– Me too!
 – Me too! 					– Me too!
 Please be my teacher.
 Earlier, he was trying to teach me something…
 Excuse me… Please be my teacher.
 Are you okay with me?
 Please teach me!
 This is cool.
 That’s too big!
 I’ll take this.
 What’s your name?
 I’m Matsuri.
 Matsuri, choose a weapon.
 What’s the matter?
 Come at me with that weapon with the intent to kill me.
 Yes, sir…
 They say an ogre with Iron Club is invincible. But you are no ogre.
 Yes, sir. Please tell me what I should choose.
 The weapon called the Rope Javelin.
 Rope Javelin…
 The sharp blade on the end of the rope
 is to keep an enemy out of one's reach, rather than for attack.
 And you seal off an enemy’s movement with the rope.
 Practice until you can control it as a part of your body.
 Yes, sir!
 Damn. Who are you guys?!
 Is this all the Sand Village Shinobi have?
 Wait.
 Leave this guy alive. We can use him to draw that one out.
 Hang in there! What is it?! What happened?
 Take me to Gaara… Quickly.
 What’s the matter?
 My mother and father were hit with countless weapons right in front of me.
 So I…
 For what purpose do you hold a weapon?
 He…
 What are…
 …these two to you?!
 Th-These guys are…
 …my friends!
 Try laying so much as another finger on them!
 I’ll clobber you!
 He said that to me.
 That’s what we’re after: Gaara.
 Gaara, we were just coming to get you.
 The patrol Ninja was attacked by somebody.
 Guys calling themselves The Four Celestials
 brandishing strange weapons, said to tell Gaara that…
 ""We declare a challenge to you, the ultimate weapon.
 ""If you don’t accept the challenge,
 ""we will take away one person close to you every day…
 ""and they shall pay the price for you.""
 You there.
 Are you Gaara’s student?
 You shall be the first sacrifice.
 What’s this Rope Javelin?!
 Wait!
 The enemy went northeast…
 Matsuri has become a first sacrifice…
 But the real target of the guys who call themselves the Four Celestials is…
 you, Gaara.
 Yeah…
 This must be brought to a Jonin Council at once…
 In the northeastern direction
 where the ones who call themselves the Four Celestials left,
 there is the Village Hidden in the Leaves of the Land of Fire,
 with the Land of Rivers sandwiched between.
 Therefore, we will be requesting the assistance of the Leaf…
 Temari, Kankuro, Gaara.
 Form a unit and prepare for pursuit immediately.
 Hold it.
 The enemy is after Gaara.
 That would be like walking right into a trap they laid.
 That’s right. Why won’t you send a party?!
 It might be a diversionary tactic by the enemy.
 The village will become shorthanded if we send out pursuers.
 Then you at least could come with us, right, Baki?!
 Most likely, the enemy is after Shukaku.
 Gaara is the Sand’s ultimate weapon.
 If we know that…
 But it's also a dangerous double-edged sword to the village.
 If they would do us the favor facing each other and perishing…
 Then at least I should go with them.
 No. You have a different mission.
 Just send those three!
 Hey, how about it?!
 I’ve been given a different mission, you see…
 Go. She’s your student, right?
 Let’s go, Kankuro.
 Will it be okay with her?!
 She’s just a kid.
 Will he come?!
 If he doesn’t come, we’ll just sacrifice those close to him one after another.
 That is…?
 It’s a message from the Sand Village!
 Gaara? Why?
 Who knows? The goal is a challenge to Gaara.
 The hostage is a Ninja school student.
 The enemy is escaping in the direction of the Land of Fire from the Land of Rivers.
 Gaara, Temari and Kankuro are chasing after them.
 At this point, that’s all we know.
 You want me to set up an operation to stop the overconfident jerks
 who challenged Gaara just with that information?
 Yeah. We’re on friendly terms with the Sand Village, so.
 Just a minute.
 They came during the Sasuke incident with much less information than now.
 Things are more bothersome than that time!
 Our range would widen significantly if we ambushed them
 instead of pursuing them.
 There’s also the incident in question in the Village of Artisans,
 and the Jonin and Chunin are all away…
 – Shizune… 					– Yes, ma’am!
 Those are the only Genin we can use now.
 Take the Genin you want to use
 and leave the village within thirty minutes!
 Sakura’s name isn’t on here.
 Yeah. She’s doing Medical Ninjutsu training now, so.
 I’ll accept the mission. But I have one condition.
 Please let me borrow Sakura.
 Sakura?
 It’s almost time! ls this everyone, Shikamaru?!
 One person still hasn’t come.
 Could that be…?
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 I can’t do a mission hungry. So I stopped by Ichiraku for a bit.
 What?! That's not fair just you getting to eat! I'll also…
 All right! Now we’ve got all our members together! We’re off!
 Huh? What? This is it?!
 I'd heard this was an operation with a mobilization
 of the Genin remaining in the village!
 This is everyone, I tell you!
 That’s messed up!
 Setting aside Sakura who’s training,
 there should still be Shino, Neji and Hinata!
 No mistake. It’s weird Akamaru and I being the only Ninja
 with search ability.
 So is this team a go-for-it super attack-type?
 Yeah. I name us Team Return the Favor.
 What lame naming!
 The guys from the Sand Village helped us during the Sasuke incident!
 In a manner, this operation will be returning the favor from that time!
 All right! Guys, let’s make sure to return the favor from that time.
 You’re not the leader!
 Shikamaru the Chunin is the leader of this platoon, right?!
 That’s right…
 Jeez, then let’s settle on a strategy and get going as soon as possible.
 Are we going in one line as we did for the Sasuke incident?
 There’s no doubting the conditions are similar to the Sasuke incident.
 However, the strategies for pursuit and ambush are completely different!
 We can’t follow them with Byakugan or by using Akamaru’s nose.
 No mistake about that.
 It’s unconventional, but since these are all the people we’ve got,
 we’ll act in groups of two basis as Two-Man Cells.
 Solo action is prohibited no matter what the case!
 We owe a debt to the Ninja in the Sand Village.
 However, although this is to repay a debt, no way will we produce casualties!
 Yeah, I got it.
 – Follow me, Ino. 					– Right!
 Choji, you go with Kiba…
 I’m counting on you, Choji, Akamaru.
 Right…
 Lee, you’re with Naruto…
 Right. Please refrain from selfish actions.
 You don’t need to remind me like that.
 Also, the four people Naruto mentioned earlier have left before us.
 Four people, do you mean Shino, Neji, Hinata and Sakura?
 Yeah. The four will be going their separate ways
 and won’t take part in future battles!
 Why not?!
 Isn’t that an incredible waste of battle strength?!
 In place of that, we get a wider range of search action…
 And we’ll have them focus on medical action in the case of battle starting.
 I have been entrusted with your lives and this is my strategy!
 All right, just wait, Gaara!
 I’ll make sure to return the favor!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 One of the enemies uses wind, huh? lnteresting. I will be her opponent!
 Then I’ll take on the guy who brandishes the sword that looks like a kid’s toy.
 We’ll take care of this. You go ahead, Gaara.
 But, will it be okay?
 We don’t need your help to deal with these chumps.
 You hurry, Gaara. That girl is your student, isn’t she?

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Die.
 Darn!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Hmm... Shadow Clone Jutsu. And there are quite a few of them.
 Here I go!
 It's impossible, after all...
 There is no way that you can beat a guy!
 There is only one way left to defeat this guy.
 Sasuke!
 I see!
 So that's your plan, Naruto!
 That's pretty good for you!
 Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill of Shadows...
 A Shuriken won't work on me.
 I see.
 This time it's aiming for my real body…
 But...
 It's not so easy!
 A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!
 This is...
 The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 A second Shuriken in his blind spot!
 But...
 Still too naïve.
 He dodged it!
 Here it is!
 Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!
 You little brat!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Naruto...
 Your strategy was outstanding.
 You've grown up… Both of you.
 The purpose of the Shadow Clones was not to take down Zabuza,
 but to hide my transformation into Demon Wind Shuriken!
 I left one clone behind, then transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.
 Then a clone threw the real me, who had transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,
 towards Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 When Sasuke got me,
 he must have realized right away who I was.
 Then he took out his own Shuriken...
 And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!
 Demon Wind Shuriken…
 Windmill of Shadows!
 Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken, I aimed for Zabuza.
 Of course I didn't think  I would defeat Zabuza!
 But I thought I'd destroy the Water Prison.
 And as a bonus I defeated his water clone, too…
 It was a huge success!
 That was a fluke…
 It was a fluke, huh!
 Still, they performed oustandingly in tandem…
 in this desperate situation.
 Despite the fact…
 that those two always fight like cats and dogs.
 Hmph…
 I got distracted and broke my Water Prison Jutsu…
 That's not it!
 You didn't break the Jutsu…
 They forced you to break it.
 I'll tell you now, the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.
 So what will you do?

 The same identical movement!
 Furthermore, at exactly the same time!

 This guy…
 My movements…!
 He's perfectly…
 Reading them.
 What?
 He's reading my mind?!
 Blast him! He's...
 giving me that barren, evil eye… right?
 Hah! You're just copying… You're a pale imitation.
 – You won't be able to beat me! – You won't be able to beat me!
 – You! 					– You!
 I'll shut that copycat monkey-mouth permamently!
 W-What's that!
 Me?
 R-Ridiculous!
 Is that his Genjutsu (Illusion Jutsu)?
 Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 W-Wha--!
 No way!
 I was just about to set forth that Jutsu...
 I can't keep up with…
 his Jutsu!
 It's over…
 Why...?
 Are you able to see into the future…?
 Yeah…
 You're going to die!
 You were right. He died.
 He's definitely dead.
 I thank you.
 I have been waiting for the chance to kill Zabuza.
 By the looks of that mask...
 You're a Tracker Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Mist.
 Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.
 Tracker Ninja?
 You don't know what a Tracker Ninja is?
 We learned it at the Academy, didn't we?
 Tracker Ninja pursue…
 guys like Zabuza who turn against the village where they were born and raised.
 And when they break away from the village,
 Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninja and assassinate them….
 in order to avoid having the secrets of the village being leaked.
 That's common knowledge!
 You should study more!
 That's right.
 I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village's Tracking Unit
 whose mission is to hunt Rogue Ninja.
 From his height and voice, he's not all that different from Naruto…
 A Tracker Ninja… ?
 He's not just an ordinary kid…
 What are you?!
 Hey you!
 Don't worry, Naruto. He's not an enemy.
 That's not what I'm asking!
 I…!
 I mean...!
 That Zabuza… That Zabuza was killed!
 That guy who was so strong…
 He was killed so easily... by a kid who's no different from me!
 We're…
 We're pathetic!
 I can't accept that!
 Well!
 I understand your disbelief.
 But… this, too, is reality.
 In this world, there are kids who are younger than you…
 and stronger than me.
 Your battle is over for now.
 I must get rid of this corpse…
 because it contains many secrets.
 Now then, please excuse me.
 He's disappeared!
 He's not here anymore.
 What was all this for?!
 What are we anyway?!
 Naruto…
 Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! DARN it!
 Things like this happen when you're a Ninja.
 If you're frustrated, apply it next time!
 Our mission hasn't ended yet.
 We must take Mr.Tazuna home.
 So sorry, everyone!
 You can rest at my house!
 Okay!
 Let's perk up and go!
 W-What!
 What happened!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 What'll we do?!
 Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!
 Gato's henchmen are probably gonna come and attack us again!
 Guess it means we've gotta fight by ourselves.
 Who knows if this training will make us stronger but,
 it's getting interesting!
 I'll definitely get stronger.

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart

 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,

 I feel a little thrown off balance.
 Let’s regroup, everybody!
 Go!
 I’m itchy, Elder Brother.
 Yeah, itchy…
 Huh?!
 My punches aren’t having any effect whatsoever.
 Naruto…
 This doesn’t look good.
 Again!
 Huh?
 I-It itches, Elder Brother.
 Yeah…feels like I’m getting a rash.
 D-Damn!
 I’m not done yet!
 Stop it, Naruto!
 It’s futile…
 – You won't swagger like that for long! – You won't swagger like that for long!
 This feels so good!
 What’s up with those guys anyway?
 You’re an idiot brat as always.
 You have it hard, don’t you?
 Having to go on a mission with that failure of a brat.
 Don’t you, Iruka?
 Why, Mizuki?!
 I’m asking you, please stop this kind of foolishness!
 Are you intending to betray your comrades from the village again?
 Comrades?
 That's right! Your comrades from the Leaf Village
 with whom you shared both pleasures and pain!
 You can understand that, can’t you?
 Comrades…huh?
 As usual, you are naïve, aren’t you…lruka?
 What I believe in is power!
 Don’t think you can shackle me with such vague bonds like that of comrades!
 Mizuki…
 I will soon get my hands on the ultimate power!
 Lord Orochimaru’s power!
 Orochimaru?!
 Then I’ll teach you a lesson!
 About how meaningless it is…
 that thing you and the other Leaf guys describe as camaraderie or whatever!
 Mizuki…
 You were an excellent Shinobi despite having committed that crime, you…
 Don’t talk so knowingly!
 Damn! They’re dodging all my attacks!
 Iruka, if you insist so much, why don't you show me?
 What degree of feeling you really have for your comrades…
 I wonder whether you’ll really be able to stop me?
 Come!
 Wait!
 Naruto! Forget about these guys! Pursue Mizuki!
 Damn…!
 I’m gonna settle this later without fail!
 Elder Brother, that guy went off.
 They all went off, didn’t they?
 Elder Brother, could this be a game of hide-and-go-seek?
 Hide-and-go-seek! Hide-and-go-seek!
 So does that mean we’re “It”?
 Those jerks!
 Making us “It” without even deciding by scissors-paper-rock!
 – Let's go, Raijin! 					– Okay!

 Don't be fooled this time!
 Shut up! It’s 100 years too soon to be arguing with me!
 I’m telling you,
 if you dilly-dally the situation’s gonna get really troublesome again!
 What?!
 Found you!
 Good job, huh, Elder Brother!
 Yeah!
 I don’t have time to be dealing with these guys!
 Elder Brother, hide-and-go-seek is fun, but aren’t you getting hungry?
 You’re really something, aren’t you, Raijin?
 Leave some for your Elder Brother!
 Of course, I will!
 Hey, you idiot brothers!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 This is no time to be eating!
 I’m telling you, it’s foolhardy to be fighting these guys!
 I already know that!
 Mizuki! Where are you?!
 What’s the matter…lruka?
 Weren’t you gonna stop me?
 Stop this foolishness, Mizuki!
 Come on out, Mizuki!
 Always be aware of an attack from behind…
 For a Shinobi, isn’t that a basic rule?
 Nicely done, Iruka.
 Pretty good!
 Always read behind the surface of your enemy’s bluffs…
 For a Shinobi isn’t that a basic rule?
 That’s my line!

 We can buy some time this way.
 All right, now's our chance…
 – Super, super hide-and-go-seek! – Super, super hide-and-go-seek!
 There are, there are two Old Lady Tsunades!
 You’re talking about the idiotic strength, huh?
 Haven’t you come to your senses yet?!
 Shut up!
 Why are you so obsessed with power!
 Because that, if anything, is everything!
 Reconsider, Mizuki! lt isn’t too late yet!
 You are naive!
 Don’t you understand the situation?!
 What’s the matter? Come on and attack, Iruka!
 You’re not my enemy!
 You’re my comrade from the same village!
 I told you, I’m tired of that kind of song and dance!
 And moreover… you’re my colleagu!
 You’re a member of the same family that inherited the same Will of Fire!
 Will of Fire, huh?
 Yes, that’s right.
 Therefore, please stop the foolishness, Mizuki!
 It irks me most when you say things like that!
 Mizuki!
 Since we’re old acquaintances I was gonna kill you quickly.
 But now I’ve decided against that.
 You’re gonna have some fun…
 I’ll give you a taste of how it feels
 to be killed slowly by your so-called comrade!

 What do you think you’re doing?
 The preparation’s done!
 Here it goes! You fatso Herculean brothers!
 Concentrate… I must concentrate…
 Stop putting on airs!

 Yeah! That’s right, isn’t it?!
 You always excelled over anything I did, didn’t you…?
 I was always being helped by you, wasn’t I?
 One year has passed already, hasn’t it?
 It’s not so easy to laugh, hiding your sadness.
 Your teacher told me that you are the center of the laughter.
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s an honor for Shinobi to die during their missions!
 My dad and mom…
 are heroes who protected this village from the Demon Fox!
 And I am the child of those heroes.
 That’s why I’m not sad even though I’m alone…
 These tears are from the happiness...
 Enough already.
 I’m always aware that you are feeling lonely.
 But you are not alone.
 All of Leaf’s Shinobi have the “Will of Fire.”
 “Will of Fire”?
 It means the will to protect the Leaf.
 As long as you have the Will of Fire,
 you and people in this village are all family.
 Iruka, I wonder if you have that.
 Yeah.
 Huh…?
 Who’s that over there?
 Mizuki…
 What are you doing there?
 Well, I heard that Iruka was depressed these days…
 I was worried and came to look for him.
 Everybody’s…worried about you, Iruka.
 Everybody’s waiting over there. Come on and play with us!
 It’s all right… Go on.
 The Mizuki that I idolized was kind…
 And he was a guy who was more thoughtful of his friends than anyone else.
 Yet…
 Please remember! Mizuki!
 You really are…
 an idiot, aren’t you?!
 L-Let go…
 Here it goes…
 S-Stop please!
 I-I feel sick…
 – Huh? 					– Eh?
 What?
 Elder Brother, don’t tell me that you…
 Sorry, Raijin… I squashed…
 our lunch!
 What?!
 Stay still, guys!
 Now take this…!
 – Give us back our lunch! – Give us back our lunch!
 What?!
 H-He’s done it, huh…
 It doesn’t look like you understand me, so let me explain.
 The real reason I was kind to you…
 Because it made me happy more than anything
 to see you in your misery!
 Hey, Iruka!
 We’re gonna go play soccer right now.
 Come join us, Iruka!
 Sure! Okay!
 I wonder if Iruka’s okay
 after all those things that happened to him…
 That’s why we need to try to cheer him up!
 Why…only him…
 Everybody makes a fuss about him
 just because of his parents getting killed by Nine-Tail…
 Serves you right…
 Even Lord Hokage?!
 Why…why is it?!
 Who is it over there?
 All right…
 I’m gonna try to gain the favor of Lord Hokage too…
 What are you doing over there?
 Well, I heard that Iruka has been depressed recently so…
 You’re lying!
 Treating a guy who’s weaker than oneself with disdain
 is the most pleasurable feeling of all, Iruka.
 You weren’t that way in the past!
 That’s why I’ve been telling you… you’re naïve!
 That kind of naiveté leads to fatal mistakes on the battleground.
 On the battleground, it’s all about how many enemies you can kill!
 If you throw a Kunai blindly in a bamboo grove,
 all that will happen is that it’ll bounce off and its path will be errant.
 If you’re gonna take aim… make it straight!
 Don’t think I’m gonna get fooled twice with the same bait!
 Damn… I’m at a disadvantage if we fight in a place like this!
 Mizuki…
 You…
 Mizuki!
 I told you, it’s useless…
 If the path is going to be errant,
 then one just needs to calculate the path of the Kunai when throwing it!
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, huh?
 Follow me!
 Where is this?
 Looks like you’re finally conscious.
 You jerk…
 You ruined our meal…
 Don’t even think we’re gonna let you leave here alive!
 I’m going for his stomach!
 I’m going for his head!
 – One, two… 					– One, two…
 – Three! 					– Three!
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Wh-What is going on?
 Gimme a break, what are you doing?!
 Wh-Who’s that?
 It’s too much of a drag to tell you my name, however…!
 The most powerful support squad assigned to this mission!
 The most powerful trio from the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 We’re Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What's with these guys?! They have super ridiculous strength!
 To think they can resist
 Shadow Possession Jutsu to this extent on sheer power!
 If Shikamaru's Jutsu gets broken now, we'll be in a hairy spot!
 Our only choice is to settle this right away.
 Are you guys ready?

87,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 It’s close.
 That’s strange.
 There hasn’t been even one trap set for a while…
 Shikamaru, what do you think?
 We’re being underestimated.
 Those guys think the only one following them is that big guy.
 They don’t need to set a trap on their man.
 How dare they underestimate us!
 It seems you’re right.
 We are being completely  underestimated.
 However, this is our chance.
 Yeah… We’ll take them by surprise.
 Your Opponent is Me!
 That Jirobo is late.
 No, he’s already here.
 Aw, c’mon, what took you so long?
 Sorry.
 It took time to eat the scums’ Chakra.
 Hey fatso, don’t you dare drag!
 Hurry up and carry that coffin…
 That’s your job, you vulgar swine.
 I know.
 What, Jirobo… You’re awfully easygoing today.
 What do you mean?
 I’m just saying I’m not handing you the coffin.
 Because you’re not Jirobo!
 This time let me do it.
 Sakon, Tayuya, you guys go ahead!
 Jirobo always corrects Tayuya’s choice of words.
 Heh, I see.
 Ninja Art: Spider Web Net.
 You!

 Naruto!
 Now Kiba, Akamaru!
 He shouldn’t be able to move in mid-air.
 Fang Over Fang!
 I won’t let you get away!
 That’s my line.
 Look at your feet.
 You!
 It’s too soon for you to think you captured us with a thing like this!
 Shut up!
 C’mon, what the hell is that fatso doing, dammit!
 It was a mistake to leave behind the weakest of us, after all.
 Got it.
 – Neji! 					– What?!
 Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji…
 Even though we’ve followed the plan, it’s no good.
 I’m going to cocoon you.
 Damn!
 Damn it! Damn it!
 What’s with this thread?! It won’t cut.
 It’s useless.
 My thread is so strong that even if two elephants pulled away,
 it wouldn’t break.
 Shadow Clone… Interesting.
 The thread is sticking…
 This stickiness is probably made
 by mixing Chakra with his special body fluid.
 Moreover, this strength. Even after it’s been released from his hands…
 Chakra’s continuously flowing in the thread.
 It’s impossible… The level of the Jutsu is unrealistic.
 Calm down… Just calm down…
 my Chakra.
 Ninja Art: Gum Style Spider Thread.
 It’s a different color than the thread from before.
 What’s he gonna do?
 It’s quickly solidifying, huh…
 You are the first one, so it’s like a little entertainment.
 Now I’ll play a game to see which of you is the real one.
 What did you say?!
 First is…you at the end.
 Naruto!
 It was a clone, huh. Well, this one next!
 What a lucky guy.
 Next, I’ll do two at a time. The odds are 2 to 1.
 This guy has a great luck, but it's either one or the other now!
 Turns out he made it to the last.
 Well, it was fun as a game, but now the game’s over.
 Die!
 The first one is done.
 What?!
 I see, the real body made its shadow clones get caught,
 and hid himself and waited for a chance, huh.
 For a small fish like that to make such a plan in those circumstances...
 You're not too bad…but …
 You’re at the end of the line. Die!
 What?!
 Naruto, your stall was helpful.
 Neji!
 You… How…?!
 Substance with Chakra base…
 It’s meaningless in front of Gentle Fist
 that destroys by pouring Chakra through.
 That guy’s Jutsu…
 Evidently I’m the only one who can fight it.
 Go!
 I’ll take care of this.
 What’s wrong? Hey, Akamaru.
 Apparently, this guy’s stronger than the fatso before.
 Quite a bit stronger.
 If we’re not prepared for “one person, one kill,”
 then it’s not going to work out.
 That’s what you said earlier.
 Yeah, that’s right.
 Plus, we won’t be able to catch up with Sasuke if we stall here.
 Choji hasn’t come back either.
 The reason we’re doing this
 is because of the mission to bring back Sasuke.
 But that’s not all.
 What we are after and trying to protect is the bond
 of the Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Do you remember Iruka’s words at the Third Hokage’s funeral?
 Iruka Sensei, why do people risk their lives for others?
 When someone dies,
 they depart with their past, present and future.
 Many people die on missions or at war.
 And their death is surprisingly unceremonious…they simply die.
 Hayate was one of those people.
 Those who die have dreams and goals, too…
 But everyone has things that are equally important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers, the people of their village,
 the people important to you.
 The connection to the people you trust and help mutually,
 the people important to you from the day you were born.
 And the thread that connects you and your people
 gets stronger through time.
 It’s not a theory.
 That’s what a person does as the thread is established
 because they’re important to you…
 Look, Sasuke is heading towards Orochimaru.
 We can’t let Orochimaru get a hold of someone from our village.
 Absolutely not.
 And…
 Naruto…
 Your eyes are better than mine.
 Right now, Sasuke is…
 in the darkness.
 Hurry up and go! I’ll catch up with you all!
 Gotcha!
 Okay! Let’s go!
 You along with Choji, be sure to catch up!
 Yeah…
 Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!
 Heh…think I’ll let them get away?!
 Byakugan!
 Here it comes!
 This guy’s pretty good…
 Neji!
 That’s Neji all right!
 Not yet… I won’t let you escape that easily!
 I won’t let you go any further from here!
 It’s useless.
 Well, that’s fine.
 It seems you’re the strongest out of the lot.
 Aw man, now I wanna play…
 It’s such a waste if a game isn't played little by little.
 For starters, I’ll play and kill you in three minutes.
 I got you.
 You’re pretty good at handling Chakra and you’ve got sharp eyes.
 You release Chakra from the Chakra points in your hands
 like a sharp needle.
 You see the thin part of the thread with Chakra running through it, and attack.
 I see, I’ve heard from Lord Orochimaru…
 This is what’s called Gentle Fist, isn’t it?
 But if you can’t use those annoying hands,
 they can’t cut my threads either.
 Man, games. The instant you know the rules of engagement,
 they’re no longer interesting.
 It’s only been a minute, but I’m already tired of you.
 Die!
 Ninja Art: Gum Style Spider Thread
 What?!
 How did he…?!
 I’ll explain, specially to you.
 It’s not just my hands
 I can release Chakra from all of the Chakra points on my body.
 And it’s game over.
 Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 The attack on his Chakra points is ineffective.
 On top of that,
 he switched to a long-distance attack to avoid Gentle Fist.
 This guy blocks my every move and he quickly reads my hands.
 This is bad. I’m at a disadvantage if the fight drags on.
 And if he noticed that, then…

 Huh? You guys are…
 Hey, are you visiting someone at the hospital too?
 Yes.
 You too, Lady Tsunade?
 Well, I guess…
 She just doesn’t want to stay in the executive office…
 Shut up!
 Hinata, don’t faint when you see Kurenai Sensei.
 P-Please let's not talk about that.
 Did something happen?
 When we were visiting Naruto in the hospital in the past…
 Shino!
 This girl fainted when she saw Naruto all covered with bandages.
 Kiba!
 I’ll…I’ll be fine this time!
 I finally found you…!
 Old Lady Tsunade, I need to talk to you!
 Huh? Hinata!
 Naruto…
 – Naruto is…so close! – Hinata? Hinata! What's wrong?

 Do you have a fever or something? Huh?
 Hey…
 H-Hey, Hinata…?!
 Hey Hinata!
 Are you okay?! Get a hold of yourself!

 Naruto…
 The Search for the Rare Bikochu Beetle
 Hey, you woke up.
 So Mizuki didn’t know anything, you said?
 Tsunade interrogated him herself.
 He didn’t have any information
 that would lead to Orochimaru’s current whereabouts…
 After all, that guy was nothing but a disposable pawn to Orochimaru, huh.
 So it seems…
 We still don’t know where Sasuke went…
 And that’s the result after a desperate fight with Mizuki…
 That can’t sit right with Naruto either…huh?
 Please Old Lady Tsunade, say it’s okay!
 When I say no, I mean no!
 As a result, Lady Tsunade wasn’t able to concentrate on her work.
 Naruto’s been breathing down her neck the whole time
 asking her to let him go off in search of Sasuke.
 So she sneaked out of her office, but…
 He was lying in wait for her here.
 Naruto…
 I’ve asked you numerous times already!
 Please let me go in search of Sasuke!
 I’ve told you numerous times already. lmpossible!
 Why!
 You have some training to do!
 I can’t because Pervy Sage isn’t around!
 We have zero leads on either Orochimaru and Sasuke.
 So how are you planning to search for him?
 I can figure it out somehow!
 If there aren’t any leads, I’ll go find some!
 So please let me go do it!
 You’re stubborn, aren't you?
 You’re stubborn too, Old Lady Tsunade!
 – Please let me go! – No, you may not!
 If I say I’m going, I’m going!
 Shut up! No means no!
 Byakugan!
 All right! Good work, Neji!
 Move in another half step right there!
 Yes sir!
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 Let’s take a break, Neji.
 Yes.
 Have some tea too.
 Thank you…
 If Hinata was here, she should have observed a little.
 Hinata prepared this…?
 It would supplement her training by observing…
 Byakugan!
 Let’s take a break.
 Yes.
 Food! Food!
 That was pretty well done.
 I would say that you’re getting closer to perfecting the technique.
 It’s thanks to you both.
 You’re so kind to join me in my special training every day…
 We’re a team.
 When a comrade in the team is in a fix,
 one offers a helping hand.
 That’s only natural…
 A comrade…
 If a comrade suddenly disappears,
 it must be awfully hard.
 You’re talking about Naruto, aren’t you?
 Isn't there some way we could help him?
 I’d like to help him out in some way too…but…
 Lady Hokage was telling Naruto…
 that there are no leads at all.
 There may be one resource…
 Really?!
 I’m talking about Bikochu.
 Bikochu?
 Are you talking about those rare insects…?!
 I have heard that they had become extinct some time ago.
 Since there was a possibility that they could become extinct,
 the Aburame Clan discontinued using them,
 so a miniscule number of them should still be alive.
 Lady Tsunade, what are Bikochu?
 Well…it’s not surprising that you don’t know about them.
 The last time that Bikochu were used
 was before the last Great War…
 Bikochu are one kind of insect used by insect handlers.
 Larvae which have hatched from eggs become chrysalises in no time at all,
 then emerge and turn into imagos.
 They are then made to recognize scents…
 and they are able to track even the faintest scent…
 to its source.
 Their olfactory sense is several thousand times greater than a Ninja Hound's.
 They are insects capable of exhibiting that skill in an exceptional way.
 However, Bikochu lay eggs only once every several years…
 This year is actually the year in which they lay eggs.
 And right now is exactly the time when they hatch.
 I see.
 There are still some of Sasuke’s belongings left in the village…
 Right?
 If one makes the Bikochu, recognize that scent…
 We may be able to locate Sasuke’s whereabouts, right?
 What is the probability of finding a Bikochu?
 Frankly speaking, not very high. Perhaps 10%.
 10% huh…
 As you guys know,
 the situation in the village is currently very grave…
 We don’t have the leeway of allowing even Genin to sit around and play.
 However, fortunately or unfortunately, Kurenai has been hospitalized,
 so you guys, Squad Eight, no longer have a mission.
 Rather than just letting you sit around and play,
 I’d rather place my bet on that 10% possibility.
 Huh… you mean…
 Shino Aburame. Kiba Inuzuka. Hinata Hyuga.
 I order you to search for the Bikochu!
 – All right! 					– All right!
 I designate Shino as the leader this time.
 And…that spy up there!
 Oww…!
 Naruto…
 You’re going to go even if I try to stop you, right?
 Yup!
 In that case, I have no choice but to let you go…
 However…
 This is your last chance.
 If you don’t find the Bikochu…
 you must give up on Sasuke!
 Wha--?
 You understand?!
 It’ll be fine… I’ll find it without fail.
 All right. You won’t go back on your word, right?
 Yeah! Leave it to me!
 You’re easily pleased, aren’t you?
 Owww!
 Naruto…
 Sasuke…
 Hinata.
 Good morning.
 Neji will be here soon for his training…
 Please prepare tea as always.
 Well…
 Huh? What’s the matter?
 I need to go… on a mission starting now…
 A mission, huh…
 In that case, it can’t be helped…
 I’m heading out…
 Don’t be a burden to the others.
 Yes, sir!
 I’m…I’m sorry! I’m in a hurry…
 The way she handled her physical response just now…
 Hinata…
 You’re late, Hinata!
 I’m sorry!
 All right then! Let’s head out!
 Let’s go!
 Huh?
 Why are you walking at such a leisurely pace?!
 It takes a Shinobi two days on foot
 to get to the habitat of the Bikochu …
 There’s no need to make haste from the very start.
 But what if the eggs hatch before we get there?
 The eggs of Bikochu only hatch on the day after it’s rained…
 There’s no sign of it raining any time soon…
 But…if by some remote chance…
 Naruto.
 Wh-What is it?
 I am the leader of this team.
 While we are on this mission, you will obey the orders of your leader.
 Kiba, I can’t believe you’re able to work with that kind of guy…
 Well, I’ve gotten used to it…
 I’m sure you’ll bond with him too, Naruto.
 I wonder about that…
 Naruto and the others left a while ago.
 I see.
 Didn’t you want to go too?
 When it comes to searching for insects,
 Shino, who’s an insect handler, is number one…
 And then Hinata who has Byakugan…
 and Kiba and Akamaru who have sensitive noses are there too…
 So there’s really no role that I could play!
 What I must do right now…
 is to become a Medical Ninja as soon as I possibly can!
 What’s the matter, Shino?!
 The sun’s going down. We’re setting up camp.
 Got it.
 – Huh? 					– Okay.
 Huh? What…?!
 We’re gonna set up camp already?!
 I’m not tired at all yet! Let’s go further!
 Naruto, the leader of this team is me.
 I-I understand!
 Okay then…let’s sleep.
 Huh…we’re gonna sleep already?!
 Many animals and plants go to sleep at sunset
 and awake at sunrise.
 In order to search for insects,
 we must understand the rhythm of living creatures with our own bodies…
 But…the sun’s just set…
 Naruto, I am the leader of this team…
 Okay, okay. I got it!
 There’s no way I can sleep so early…
 Yeah, right…
 All that complaining and guess who's the first one to fall asleep?
 I have to pee…
 Huh?
 Huh?
 What’s that?
 It’s a waterfall…
 Hey… Is somebody there?
 S-Say…
 Damn it…!
 S-Sorry. Did I scare you?
 Huh?
 There’s nobody there…
 Huh, Naruto… Did you catch a cold?
 Yeah…a little…
 After sleeping so much you’re still tired?
 Well, uh…
 When I woke up last night to pee, I saw something awesome…
 Did you catch a cold too, Hinata?
 No, I’m okay…
 And…what was that awesome thing?
 It was a beautiful woman in the middle of the waterfall!
 Huh?
 When that person moved her arms, the water would suddenly move too!
 It was awesome!
 And what happened then…
 When I tried to speak to her, she suddenly vanished.
 You must have been dreaming or something.
 It's starting to feel that way…
 You idiot!
 Your face is red, Hinata.
 You might have really caught a cold.
 Huh…really, I’m fine…
 This fruit is edible. This will be our meal today.
 Got it.
 We can save on our food supplies too.
 There’s one thing I need to warn you about.
 On rare occasions, this fruit grows to the size of a human being.
 However, those fruits are damaged inside.
 Don’t tamper with them under any circumstance.
 There’s nobody who would eat something that huge.
 N-Naruto…!
 He’s eating it…
 Naruto… We’re going on ahead…
 I’ll…I’ll be right behind you!
 Sorry to keep you waiting!
 Wait just a second!
 Hey…aren’t we there yet?
 Yes.
 We're here!
 What…?
 Wow!
 I’ve never seen anything like this before.
 This certainly isn’t a place where humans could inhabit.
 That’s right… That’s why it’s paradise for insects.
 D-Don’t tell me…
 Could it be that…over there…?
 You mean that’s where the Bikochu are?
 No problem. lt’s better than the Chunin Exam.
 Damn…The foothold crumbles easily…
 – Naruto… 					– What?
 As the leader, I’m warning you…
 At a time like this, what is it?!
 Don’t fall.
 I already know that without your telling me!
 Naruto!
 No way…!
 That was close…
 Those were insects, huh…
 That’s why I warned you.
 When this mission is over,
 I’m definitely gonna kick that guy’s butt!
 This is…the Bikochu forest.
 Let’s go.
 There’s no mistake. Those are Leaf Shinobi.
 The fact that those guys came to a place like this
 means their objective is…
 Yeah…it’s the same as ours… the Bikochu.
 We’re not gonna let them take any Bikochu.
 The Bikochu, … belong to us, the Kamizuru Clan!

 You should run away too!
 There’s a monster up there!
 A monster…?
 What could it be? This monster thing?!
 It’s a g-gigantic snake! lt destroyed the castle in a flash!
 How big of a snake?!
 Me too, at my village before…
 I was attacked by a huge snake!
 We must hurry, Naruto!
 That snake is probably the same one that you saw before.
 Destroy the Leaf Village…?!
 And your answer is?
 Lady Tsunade!
 No! You must not believe in their sweet talk…
 Your brother and my uncle wouldn’t want any of that!
 Their wishes…
 Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
 And dreams… Did you forget them ?!
 I know it!
 Even if you are like this now, you still…
 Open your eyes! Wake up, please!
 Shut up, Shizune!
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices are needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to do to prepare them.
 Lady Tsunade, let’s kill them right here! lt’s our chance!
 With you and me, now we can…!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Sure, I am weak now.
 However…
 I also know Tsunade’s weakness.
 That’s right, he is one of the Sannin like Tsunade.
 So he knows that…
 I see it’s not cured yet…
 your fear of blood.
 Hemophobia…?
 Shall we get going, Kabuto?
 Tsunade… I’ll be expecting a favorable answer from you.
 Looks like we were a little too late…
 Is this that snake’s doing, too?!
 – Let’s go, Naruto! 					– Huh?
 Tsunade isn’t here any more.
 Geez, you keep telling me that…!
 Welcome!
 Hey, you ol’ man, give me another shot!
 Lady Tsunade, you’re drinking too much!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Heck, she’s nowhere to be found!
 Dragging me around here and there,
 but after all, we haven’t found a single trace!
 Hmm?
 Well, let’s dine here for now.
 Huh?
 Isn’t this a pub?
 So what?
 I've told you so many times! I’m still underage!
 You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink. Kids should only be eating snacks.
 – Well then… 					– Welcome!
 There’s no need to dine here!
 We can go to a ramen noodle shop or something!
 How stupid! You can gather information in this type of place…
 Huh…?
 Huh?!
 Tsunade!
 Jiraiya?!
 Why…are you here?
 I’ve finally found you! I’m exhausted…
 That gal is Tsunade?!
 She’s 50 years old for real?
 Now, that’s a swindle.
 I can’t believe… I met two of the Sannin in one day.
 Here you are!
 In any case… Today is a day I see many old friends.
 You mean Orochimaru…
 What happened?
 Nothing, really. We exchanged a greeting.
 Is it really true that this gal is the Kunoichi
 who can heal any kind of wound?
 What about you?
 What do you want from me?
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 Hey, ol’ man, gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!
 All right, in a moment.
 The Fifth Hokage?! What’s this out of the blue?!
 What the heck is going on?!
 Do you know about the Third Hokage?
 The Third Hokage? So, he really was…
 Orochimaru did it, right?
 I heard about it. directly from him.
 Orochimaru did it…?
 Orochimaru?!
 Did he really killed the old man, the Third Hokage?!
 Who is this Orochimaru?!
 Just like us, he’s one of the Sannin.
 Why?! The Sannin are all from Leaf Village, right?
 Then why--?!
 Who’s this brat?
 He’s Naruto Uzumaki.
 This brat is… that Nine-Tailed Fox…?
 Hey, you just hold it there!
 I am not done talking yet!
 This Orochimaru?! This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.
 Who the heck is he?!
 He’s a legendary Sannin, right?!
 Then knowing that…
 why would you, Pervy Sage, leave such a guy alone?!
 Besides…
 What do you mean this person is the Fifth Hokage?!
 Naruto, be quiet for a moment.
 But…!
 Just shut up!
 I’ll say this again.
 They are demanding that you become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.
 So what’s your answer?
 Will you accept it?
 I’ll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you loved…
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!
 What do you say…Tsunade?
 Lady Tsunade…
 I really don’t get it!
 Impossible…
 I refuse!
 I remember…those words.
 You said those same words when I asked you to go out with me.
 What the heck are you talking about?! You said it yourself!
 Didn’t you say that you will bring her back to the village
 and have her treat Sasuke and Kakashi Sensei ?!
 But what’s this demand for her to be the Hokage?!
 And, on top of that, she refuses!
 Lady Tsunade…
 Could she be thinking of making a deal with Orochimaru?
 Calm down.
 There can’t be no other Fifth Hokage, but this Tsunade.
 During the dreadful Great War Era,
 she contributed tremendously to the Leaf’s victory.
 To this date,
 there’s no one who can rival her combat and medical skills.
 Still more, this Tsunade is the granddaughter of the First Hokage.
 So together with her talents,
 there’s no one else more suited to becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 If she becomes Hokage,
 that means that she’ll come back to the village.
 And then, as I’d told you, she can treat the two.
 Besides, this is what the Leaf’s top decision-making advisors settled upon.
 Genin like you have no say on this matter.
 Jiraiya…
 Unlike your previous apprentice,
 this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit, he’s ugly to match.
 What?!
 It’s tough on anyone to be compared to the Fourth Hokage.
 He had all the qualities to be the greatest Ninja in all history.
 Brimming with talent in Jutsu, and he had a brilliant mind!
 Popular with people and well… he was as handsome as me.
 But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.
 Risking his own life for the village…
 Life is different from money…
 To easily risk it and lose it, is a fool’s doing!
 Did she say “fool”?!
 Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage
 seemed to want to subdue the disturbances of war above all else.
 But after all, they died in vain,
 in the midst of their dreams for the village.
 You have changed, Tsunade…
 I don’t know what you thought in your heart before,
 but to say such thing out loud…
 Although I look young, I’m already in my 50s…
 Years change people.
 Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei…
 No wonder he died showing off at that old age!
 Hokage is a bother.
 No one but a fool would take it on.
 Why you--?!
 – Let go of me! – Don't! We're in a pub.
 I said, let go of me!
 Lady Tsunade…!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old man and the Fourth Hokage…
 It doesn’t matter if you are a woman!
 I’ll clobber you with all my might!
 You’re pretty gutsy… confronting me like this.
 Let’s take this outside, brat!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Though I may not look it, I am one of the Sannin.
 Why should I even take a Genin seriously.
 What did you say?!
 An advance notice for a KO?
 I don’t mean one minute…
 With one finger. This is enough to take you down.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Well…
 Come on, kiddo.
 D-Don’t make fun of me!
 Darn it!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Forehead poking?!
 Why that no good--!
 She’s strong…
 Hey, brat!
 I’ll ask you one thing before you faint.
 Why…get so passionate at the mention of Hokage’s name?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name, no matter what!
 Because Hokage is…
 Because Hokage is my dream!
 That kid…
 What? She’s a bit off her guard…
 I can’t tackle her head on.
 Then, I should use that Jutsu now…
 Concentrate!
 Oh, no!
 Wha--?! This Jutsu is…!
 Take this!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 It's been a long time since we drank alone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?
 I didn't necessarily want to see you.
 Don't say that.
 By the way, you're prettier than before.
 You haven't changed a bit.
 Understand this. I'm not interested in you.
 Neither am I. After all, you're actually 50 years old--
 – Did you say something? – No, nothing.
 I was just remembering the old days.

 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsu in survival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 He’ll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be careful…
 It’s the first A-Ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.
 Village in Distress: A New A-Ranked Mission!
 Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked mission in the condition we are in?!
 What do we have to do?!
 Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company of the Sand Village.
 Sakura…
 Release the Genjutsu on Naruto and Shikamaru,
 and go after Sasuke.
 I feel uneasy… about that unusual Chakra.
 But then,
 we should wake up Ino and Choji and go in a large group.
 There may already be quite a large number
 of Sand and Sound Shinobi who have infiltrated this village.
 Actions lose quickness when there’s more than the fundamental four in a squad…
 and it becomes difficult to hide from the enemy.
 You learned that in the Academy's patrol practical training, right?
 Oh, I see! Then four means that you’ll come with us…
 No, I must not leave here.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 As for the rest, this Pakkun will track down Sasuke by scent!
 C-Could it be… the one other member is this puppy?!
 Hey! Little girl! Don’t you be calling me a cute puppy!
 I didn’t say…cute.
 Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsu on Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Okay!
 Release!
 What is it…Sakura?
 Get down!
 I’ll tell you later! Just stay down!
 Shikamaru…you were… from the beginning…
 Owwee!
 You were able to release Genjutsu, too!
 Why were you pretending to be asleep?!
 Humph! I don’t want to end up getting involved!
 Heck no… I could care less about Sasuke!
 Owwee!
 W-What's going on…?
 Naruto! Behind you!
 F-Fast…
 Not just fast…
 Guy Sensei!
 Now, I’ll announce the mission!
 As soon as you’ve heard what the mission is, go through that hole.
 Track down Sasuke, join up and then stop him!
 Then await next orders in a safe place.
 Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!
 I’ll tell you the reason en route!
 Let’s go!
 Jeez… Why me?
 Hey, boy!
 Huh…?
 If this mission is a success,
 as a reward I’ll let you touch my paw-pads.
 So don’t sulk like that!
 Huh?
 See?
 They’re soft and supple!
 Su..pple…?
 Yes, very…
 Soft and Supple!
 Let’s just go!
 H-Hey!
 Will it be okay with just them?
 They’ll be okay. Pakkun is with them.
 As long as they don’t pursue too far…
 To think I’d be able to fight you again…
 This barrier can’t be broken unless it’s from the inside.
 If Lord Hokage would just take out one of those four,
 we could help…
 Hey, it’s gonna start soon.
 Put up a barrier on the inside, too!
 Sure!
 Hm… It doesn’t look like I’ll be able to get out this easily.
 You don’t really mean that.
 It’d be tougher for you if someone came in and got in the way, right?
 Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!
 That’s too easy!
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 With such a weak technique…
 It sucks to get old, eh, Sarutobi Sensei?
 Substitution?!
 Earth Style: Great Mud River!
 Is this it?
 I don’t think so!
 Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!
 Fire Dragon Bomb!
 He’s combined Earth and Fire!
 Excellent, Lord Hokage!
 Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.
 Very good…
 Really, I’ve been grossly underestimated.
 Did you think you could kill me with that level of Jutsu?
 Humph… A hateful fellow as usual!
 Don’t say that.
 A high maintenance student is cute. Right, Sarutobi Sensei?
 Something’s strange…
 All of the Academy’s classes doing self-study.
 And that smoke…
 That's coming from the direction of the exam arena.
 Isn't there some disturbance to the east?
 I wonder if something happened…
 This is definitely strange!
 But sudden self-study is sure a smack in the eye!
 It’s been like this for a while!
 Yeah. Iruka Sensei and everyone are late…
 Aren’t they, Konohamaru?
 Konohamaru?
 Yikes!
 Jeez, what is this?!
 And Mom just bought this for me!
 I’ll loan you my colored pencil.
 What’re you saying?! This color is this spring’s new color!
 Aww, what'll I do?
 That is…?
 I wonder if Naruto and the others went to stop Sasuke?
 Those brats?
 But surely, some Genin won’t be able to make any difference…
 Hm? Is this the data of that kid back there?
 You give him too much credit.
 Think again!
 You’ll trip up if you underestimate him.
 Teachers' Office
 There is information that several units have already infiltrated the village…!
 We should evacuate the students to a safe place right away!
 Yes… And without causing panic among the students!
 Then let’s evacuate the students
 as soon as possible under the pretense of an evacuation drill!
 Isn’t it about time we stopped playing around?
 This isn’t an Academy class, so…
 You have a point.
 Did you foresee your final moments?
 I won’t go easy on you just because you’re doddering.
 I look forward to it.
 Depending on your Jutsu,
 I might have to have you start over at the Academy!
 Please don’t disappoint me too much!
 W-Wow…
 What Chakra?!
 Yeah… It seems the air is bearing down within the body!
 Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!
 That technique!
 One!
 He is using a Summoning Jutsu as a shield.
 And this dead person is…
 Two!
 I must stop the third one at any cost…!
 Three!
 It looks like the third one was no good. Oh well…
 It looks like I stopped the third one.
 Now, this is where it gets tough…
 He summoned those two of all people…
 I-It can’t be! Those personages are…!
 Those personages are?
 Now, what will you do, Sarutobi Sensei…?
 No…
 Lord…Third Hokage.
 Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!
 Oh, what a day!
 My favorite colored pencil didn’t have to break like that!
 Lousy evacuation drill… Self-study was better.
 Konohamaru’s been quiet, hasn’t he? I wonder what’s wrong?
 Huh? Yeah.
 After the whole school does a long self-study,
 the whole school does an evacuation drill.
 This is too strange!
 Okay! Stop! Get in line!
 That look on Iruka Sensei’s face…
 Something’s definitely going on here!
 And also…
 Okay, everyone! Don’t go off on your own.
 That rainbow… It's been bugging me for a while!
 What’s that, Old Man? There’s a strange rainbow!
 It’s an unusual rainbow!
 Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?
 Yeah! And I’ve never seen such a pretty rainbow!
 I see, I see. But, Konohamaru…
 Hmm?
 Rainbows used to symbolize snakes…
 And it’s said that they bode evil.
 Such a pretty thing? That’s a lie!
 I see, I see.
 Symbolizes snakes… ls something happening?
 Long time no see…Saru.
 Oh, it’s you… You’ve gotten old, Sarutobi.
 I never thought I would meet the great brothers in this manner…
 It’s regretful.
 This is bad.
 That Summoning Jutsu…
 Who in the world are they?!
 Please prepare yourselves…
 Lord First Hokage…
 Lord Second Hokage!
 That’s right…
 The one with the black hair is the First Hokage.
 The one with the white hair is the Second Hokage.
 They are both reputed to be the highest Shinobi
 and they are the Hokages who built the today’s Leaf Village!
 Reanimation, huh?
 This youth summoned us with the Forbidden Jutsu, then?
 He’s something else…
 Then, Sarutobi!
 Does this mean we must…fight you?
 Let’s stop the old people get-together talk…
 Shall we get started?
 There’s always fighting… no matter when you live.
 You like that, don’t you?
 No good will come by deriding the dead and playing around with time!
 I get it! So that’s what happened!
 That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
 So, why am I pulled into this?! This is such a drag!
 It can’t be helped! lt’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.
 This way!
 That brat, huh…
 Let’s go!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!
 Once we Genin get caught, that will be the end.
 In that case, we should ambush and attack them.
 I already thought of it, but it’ll probably be no use.
 Then, what should we do?!
 There is only one choice.
 Next time, “A Shirker’s Call to Action: Layabout No More!”
 It isn’t my style, but we have no choice, I guess.

 that you are already…finished.
 Poor thing.
 This child is trembling like a puppy
 Now, Kabuto…
 Get rid of her, but don’t make her suffer.
 I understand.
 Sasuke…
 I-I’ll do anything for you!
 So I’m begging you… Please stay here!
 You are really annoying.
 Please don’t go!
 Sakura…
 Thank you…
 Sasuke…
 Wait!
 Hmm?
 Did you…say something?
 Wait!
 Where’s Sasuke! Where is Sasuke?
 It couldn’t be that… your body is already Sasuke's…?
 There’s no need to keep it a secret any longer.
 It’s all right, Kabuto, go on and tell her.
 He was a little late in getting here.
 Lord Orochimaru wasn’t able to wait for Sasuke,
 and already had been reincarnated into another vessel.
 So Sasuke is all right?! Somewhere in this building…
 Lord Orochimaru gave Sasuke the Curse Mark,
 so he could wait for the next opportunity to reincarnate.
 But…
 Not all humans can tolerate Curse Marks.
 No way, there’s no way that Sasuke could be…
 That’s right, Sasuke wasn’t able to tolerate the Curse Mark
 and so he died.
 That's a lie.
 It has to be a lie!
 What would telling a lie like that accomplish?
 To someone that’s going to die… As you are?
 If you want to see him that badly I’ll let you see him.
 When you die, you can see him in the other world.

 Sakura, don't you believe…

 So it’s Naruto, I thought you’d drowned and died a long time ago but…

 – Yikes! 					– Oww!
 You’re too slow!

 Since you and Orochimaru are here,
 it means Sasuke is probably here too!
 Tell us the truth right now!
 Wh-What the heck? My body won’t move…
 Have a good look at yourself.
 Wh-What’s this?
 Those are Chakra Threads.
 Chakra Threads?
 While you were attacking earlier,
 I wrapped the thread around you.
 Take a good look at where that thread is connected.
 That’s right.
 Those Chakra Threads are…
 connected to my heart’s Chakra Network.
 And Naruto, the thread that’s wrapped around you
 is connected through my Chakra Network to your organs and to your heart.
 See, can you hear that?
 My heart and your heart will eventually become connected as one!
 – Damn! 					– Naruto!
 It’s no use. That thread is formulated and spun with Chakra
 and it will absolutely not break.
 Now our hearts are completely synchronized…
 The Chakra which passes through this thread
 via the Chakra Network from my heart is controlling your heart ,you see.
 It’s no use, even though it’s my heart…
 If my heart beat gets faster, your heart will get faster too…
 And when my heart stops beating…
 you will die too!
 Don’t! If you stop your heart, you’ll die too!
 That’s right. But that doesn’t mean much.
 Since I’ve already promised my body to Lord Orochimaru…
 Wh-What the heck are you gonna do?!
 If I crush this heart…
 you will die too!
 If I crush this heart…
 you will die too!
 Now, together we will…
 Naruto!
 How’s it feel to have your heart seized?
 It’ll be all right…
 You’ll be out of your misery right away!
 Stop it!
 How foolish, if you kill me Naruto will die too.
 What I’m gonna cut…
 is this!
 There’s no use you know,
 It’s impossible to cut thread formulated and made from Chakra.
 Even Lady Tsunade’s great strength wouldn’t be able to break it.
 What should I… What should I do?!
 Naruto is suffering right in front of my eyes and yet…
 I can’t do anything!
 Sakura…!
 I…absolutely will not lose!
 Until I’ve fulfilled my promise!
 You bravado ends there.
 Now, shall we die together?
 And go to the place where Sasuke is waiting?
 Naruto!
 Sakura!
 – Sasame?! 					– Sakura…
 Stick this tag on a Kunai Knife!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Naruto?! Hey, are you okay? Naruto!
 No way…
 It can’t be…
 No way!
 Naruto!
 Ahh… My chest right now is beating with joy.
 Idiot! It was a waste for me to have worried!
 Sorry, Sakura…
 You’re so worthless!
 That’s right, Sasame! Why are you here?
 Well, it’s…
 I was saved by Sasame, you know.
 Me too.
 What do you mean?
 Water came rushing into that trap pit we were in earlier…
 That’s it! The lid to the pit!
 Damn!
 When the water reached the ceiling,
 I desperately tried to open the lid, but wasn’t able to escape…
 I was told by Master Jiraiya to go to where Hanzaki is.
 But I got concerned about Arashi, so I came…
 Naruto!
 Hey! Thanks!
 Th-The frog spoke…!
 Well, come to think of it,
 there’s no way you could open the lid of the trap by pushing on it.
 Geez!
 But how come the thread that I couldn’t cut with the Kunai Knife,
 be cut when I wrapped it with Sasame’s tag?
 Because the Chakra Thread is a Secret Technique
 within the secrets of our Fuuma Ninja Technique…
 Of the Fuuma?!
 Oh I see… So who the heck is this?!
 Oh!
 She is…from earlier!
 Mistress Kagero…
 She’s a Fuuma Jonin.
 Sasame!
 Sasame…
 I was resurrected by Lord Orochimaru…
 You! You’re being tricked by Orochimaru!
 Where is Sasuke?
 And Arashi? Where’s Sasame’s cousin!
 Lord Orochimaru is…
 going to raise our Fuuma clan…
 to the center stage of Shinobi again.
 You’re still talking about that stuff?!
 At least tell Sasame the truth!
 So it’s there! He’s in there!
 Sasame and Arashi… You two were so close…
 Then it’d be better if you didn’t see him.
 Mistress Kagero …
 What do you want to do, Sasame?
 Do you want to wait here?
 I will see him! No matter what’s in store for me!
 I came all the way here to see Arashi!
 Yeah! You’ve got guts!
 All right! Let’s go together!
 Yeah! Let’s go!
 Sasame…
 There might be some sort of trap…
 Leave it to me!
 Orochimaru?!
 Good of you to come, Sasame…
 Why…?
 Arashi…!
 Arashi!
 Arashi?
 I’m no longer…
 Arashi…
 Wh-What the heck is going on?!
 The skills and bodies of the Fuuma Jonin were combined into one…
 and I’ve been reborn as the ultimate Ninja you see…
 Now, I’ll show you my ultimate Ninjutsu…Sasame!
 No… Arashi…
 Damn, Orochimaru!
 I will not forgive him, no matter what!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth, and
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Sorry… I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I haven’t been able to do anything, after all.
 I’m always dragging you down. I hadn’t changed at all.
 But Naruto, Sasame, you two taught me.
 That’s why I want to change the kind of person I am!

 I never thought he’d attempt to use the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
 But it’s still just this level…
 It’s completely different from the original one.
 That Tsunade… lncredibly strong as always.
 I remember a long time ago,
 getting punched by her and knocked back nearly 100 meters…
 At any rate, Naruto’s hopeless.
 Are you okay?
 Jiraiya, was it you…
 who taught him that Rasengan, the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
 Rasengan…?!
 I’m his teacher, after all.
 Humph…You and the Fourth Hokage are the only ones who can use that Jutsu.
 Are you in your right mind…
 showing someone Jutsu that he can’t master?
 Don’t give him false hope.
 That’s why the moony kid starts joking about becoming a Hokage!
 It’s no joke! Stupid! Stupid!
 If I have three days, I’ll master this Jutsu!
 You said it, kid.
 Men don’t go back on their word!
 Hah! I stand by my words.
 That’s my Ninja Way.
 Then…how about a wager?
 A wager…?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you have what it takes to become the Hokage
 and give you this necklace.
 Lady Tsunade! That’s the precious--!
 I don’t need such a sorry necklace!
 Don’t say such things, Naruto…
 That’s the only one of its kind in this world.
 And you could buy three mountains if you were to sell it.
 It belonged to the First Hokage.
 A-Awesome…
 Well, that’ll be fine!
 He’ll do anything for money…?
 Good…
 However, you lose if you can’t master the Jutsu in one week!
 And you’ll give me all the money you have on you.
 Oh! Gama-chan!
 When did she…?!
 Lady Tsunade! Why?
 That necklace is…
 He won’t be able to do it, anyway…
 Let’s go, Shizune.
 She never once used that necklace for a bet…
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Inheritance! The Necklace of Death!
 Huh? Who is it this late at night?
 Okay, okay. I’m coming.
 I’m sorry to bother you so late, Naruto. I need to talk to you…
 As for me, I’m going to get a good night’s rest and train tomorrow!
 I’m sorry. But I didn’t want you to misunderstand Lady Tsunade…
 As well as the necklace…
 Humph! I could care less about an old lady like that!
 Lady Tsunade is not the type of person you think she is!
 Don't speak of her like that when you don't even know her!
 I-I’m sorry…for raising my voice.
 She didn’t used to be like that.
 She was a kind person who loved the village.
 But, she changed…
 After that day…
 That day?
 What’s that day?
 The day she lost her dreams, her love, her hopes… Everything.
 All that was left was that necklace of memories…
 It’s as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.
 It’s really not something to be offered in a bet.
 I don’t care about that! She bet it on her own, right?!
 Besides…that necklace is really not something for you to wear.
 It’s not just a necklace!
 It doesn’t acknowledge anyone other than Lady Tsunade.
 If someone else wears it, that person inevitably…
 …dies!
 Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!
 I’m not a kid anymore, so I don’t need gifts on my birthday!
 What’re you saying? You’re still a kid, aren’t you?!
 But never mind that. Hurry up and open your present!
 You’ll definitely be pleased!
 Big Sister, could this be…?
 Yes… It’s the First Hokage’s, our grandfather’s necklace!
 I love you, Big Sister!
 I thought it’d be better than me having it.
 You’ve been wanting it all along, right? Take good care of it.
 Not just this necklace!
 This village is grandfather’s treasure! I’m going to protect it!
 Nawaki…
 I’m the grandson of the Hokage who built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
 You said it. Men don’t go back on their word!
 Right!
 Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather. And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Take off your headband, Nawaki.
 Just hurry up and take it off. I have another present for you.
 It’s a charm to make your dream come true.
 It’s best if you don’t look at the remains.
 There’s nothing wrong with that, is there?
 Even if she were to look,
 she wouldn’t be able to determine that it’s her little brother.
 Enough, Orochimaru!
 We are at war, now. All Shinobi end up like this.
 There are no doctors on the battlefield, so…
 However, children really get much too excited, don’t they?
 Especially on the day after they receive a present.
 Not just this necklace…
 This village is grandfather’s treasure! I’m going to protect it!
 First, in a mission where a Four-Man Cell must act alone
 for a long period of time in enemy territory,
 by deploying one of the four to be a medical specialist,
 the survival rate as well as the mission success rate
 should go up significantly.
 Therefore, establishing a framework
 to foster Ninja possessing advanced medical skills
 and the development of a medical institution
 should be considered an urgent task for the present!
 Yes indeed, it’s as you say.
 But we’re in the middle of a war now.
 It takes too much time to establish a medical framework.
 And at present, we don't have enough knowledge…
 Enemies don’t wait.
 What did you say?! Hey, old man!
 Then we’ll never…
 I agree with her.
 I don’t want the lives of the Shinobi who died to be for naught.
 There should be something we can learn from that.
 Excuse me!
 Thanks for earlier.
 What you said was right.
 Umm…
 It’s late. Shall I walk you home?
 What? Is that okay with you? Where’s your home?
 The other way.
 Then don’t bother.
 I don’t mind. I also want to talk with you.
 And I would always use this path to the Academy to pick up my little sister.
 I loved this path.
 What? You loved?
 Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf was attacked at night one year ago,
 my little sister was…
 This man…is the same as me.
 Tomorrow’s mission will be within enemy lines…
 Fighting and losing cherished people is not the only way for a Shinobi.
 Uh-huh.
 I’m living in a world of Shinobi where death always hovers.
 I want to risk my life to bring this war-torn world under control.
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 Since my little sister died, that sole thought has sustained me.
 So I’ll become the Hokage…
 An existence that protects everyone…
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 Dan…
 I’d like you…to take this.
 Hang on, Dan!
 Tsunade… I don’t want…to die yet.
 I have many things that I must…do.
 Don’t talk, Dan!
 His kidney has been blown out…
 It’s futile even for Tsunade who is known as one of the Sannin…
 I…must not…die here.
 It’ll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.
 So it’ll be okay… You’ll be saved, Dan!
 Really?
 Thank goodness…
 Dan! Hang on!
 Dan!
 Dang it! Don’t come out…
 Stop… Please stop!
 Stop… Stop…
 Stop… Stop…
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
 Stop, I say!
 That’s enough. He’s dead!
 You understand, don’t you, Naruto…?
 Ever since that day,
 Lady Tsunade has been… in a constant turmoil.
 Naruto…?
 I’m heading out…for training!
 Oh, you are already at it, I see!
 Hi, welcome!
 Why are you here?
 You’re cold. Don’t say that.
 Master Jiraiya…
 Shizune, could you leave us?
 It's been a while. I want to drink with her again.
 Master, sake! And some radish!
 Coming up!
 I’m counting on you, Master Jiraiya.
 Your radish is ready.
 Ooh. This looks good.
 At any rate, to think you’d still be taking good care of that necklace…
 I thought you’d have lost it long since to gambling.
 It’s a memento of those two, right?
 Is he on your mind…?
 Who?
 Naruto.
 Not particularly…
 Still, it’s immature, taking on that kid as an opponent…
 He shouldn’t be able to master that Jutsu in a week, right?
 That’s not what’s called a bet.
 What’s with the fit of despair?
 It’s not a fit of despair!
 Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?
 I can tell by looking at Shizune’s face.
 I don’t know what kind of deal he proposed,
 but don’t rush to a decision.
 And…let me just tell you one thing.
 The successive line of Hokages have protected
 the Leaf Village and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 You're not someone who can't understand the feelings of the previous Hokages.
 Just try doing something to betray the Leaf Village.
 When that happens, I’ll kill you myself!
 It has nothing to do with me now!
 A person who has experienced the death of people close to them
 and doesn’t feel anything is just a butcher.
 You’re different, aren’t you?
 No one cared for the welfare of the villagers more than you.
 At that time, too…
 That’s enough with the lecture!
 Why…did you bring that kid?
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
 He resembles him, doesn’t he?
 His age is about the same, too…
 Not just that…
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 Geez, you do nothing, but reckless things.
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin, so on the battlefield just run away.
 Don’t tell a man to “run away”!
 That dream… And his cockiness as well…
 No good! Dang it! Dang it! Tomorrow, for sure…!
 My head hurts.
 I totally got sick from drinking, thanks to her…
 It seems Naruto never came home last night…
 He's such a fool.
 Why don’t we make a deal?
 I’ll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Don’t you want to see those two, Tsunade?
 If I treat your arms…
 What do you intend to do with them?
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf Village!
 No! You must not believe in their sweet talk…
 Their wishes…
 Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes… And dreams… Did you forget them ?!
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Darn it! What am I doing?!
 I fell asleep at such an important time!
 Moreover, today is the day of the bet!
 Meanwhile, I don't even know where that old lady Tsunade has gone to!
 My training is not completed yet…
 I've got to play it by ear and rely on a one-shot deal!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Curse Sealing!
 Out of character.
 It appears he’s quite tired…
 To think you’ve become able to handle Sealing Jutsu…
 You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
 You...
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 Orochimaru…
 Kakashi vs. Orochimaru: Face to Face!
 Sorry, but…
 I have no business with you, Kakashi.
 But I do with the kid behind you.
 Why are you after Sasuke…?!
 It’s good for you. You already got it, right?
 You didn’t have it before, did you…?
 That.
 That...
 left eye Sharingan!
 I want it, too…
 The Uchiha power.
 Come on. Get up.
 W-What?!
 B-Bugs?
 They burst through the skin… from inside his body?!
 What a creepy guy!
 Heh! What kind of bluff are you trying to pull?
 These things are called Parasitic Insects.
 They attack their pray in groups and eat Chakra…
 If attacking in this amount…
 you’re finished, no mistake.
 If you don’t like that, give up.
 That would be in your best interests.
 If you use your left arm technique on me,
 I’ll simultaneously have the bugs exploit the opening from behind.
 Conversely, if you use your technique on the bugs,
 I’ll simultaneously exploit the opening…
 Either way, you won’t be able to get through this.
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside.
 Hey! Hold it!
 You little thief!
 Someone! Grab him!
 Uh-oh.
 Man, what a pigheaded kid.
 Making us go to trouble!
 You have potential, boy.
 I liked your eyes earlier…
 If you come with me, you can become strong.
 Follow me.
 If you come with me, you can become strong.
 You can become strong.
 Fight for me. If you do that…
 I’ll make you stronger.
 Now, please live up to my expectations…
 No longer...
 will I...
 It seems like you’re proud of your arms. You!
 S-Stop it!
 Stop!
 No longer...
 can I make things blow up in my face!
 Don’t... underestimate me!
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside, right?!
 An ace in the hole is something you set aside, right?
 What?! He could already use his right arm?!
 So the first half of the battle was a strategic move
 to make us think he couldn’t use his right arm.
 Not bad…Zaku.
 What’s your purpose?
 The recently built Sound Village. That’s my village, you see…
 You already understand, don’t you…?
 Humph! Ridiculous ambition.
 Oh, my… you said it.
 But, for that I need various pieces who will obey my every whim.
 Take this!
 So Sasuke is one of those pieces?
 No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.
 And the ones who are taking the exams now…
 are mere throw-away pieces.
 My arms!
 What’s this?!
 Earlier when I recommended that you give up…
 as a precautionary measure, I gave a suggestion to the bugs…
 to block that troublesome wind hole with their bodies and remain still.
 This is what a real ace in the hole is.
 Punk!
 Don’t…come any closer... to Sasuke!
 Even if you’re one of the legendary three Ninja,
 at the least, I can kill you as you kill me!
 What’s funny?
 What you say and what you do, are all off.
 What?
 There’s no point at all in attempting such a seal.
 You understand, don’t you?
 The heart to seek out in pursuit of the goal,
 no matter what obstructive power there may be…
 He is the possessor of that quality.
 He’s an avenger…
 So you took advantage of that, eh?
 However, Sasuke is…
 At some point, he will definitely seek me out…
 in search of power.
 Oh, and, you’re going to kill me…?
 Why don’t you try?
 That is, if you can…
 Kill you as you kill me…?!
 Am I an idiot…?
 It seems…it’s over.
 The winner! Shino Aburame!
 W-What is he, Neji?!
 Byakugan!
 He’s something else…!
 I can understand him calling bugs with a Summoning Jutsu…
 but he harbors bugs all over his body.
 S-Say what?!
 He’s of the bug tamer race that is passed down in the Leaf Village.
 Speaking of which, I’ve heard of it…
 The story of a race that as they come into this world,
 possess the secret technique of loaning their bodies to bugs
 as a nest and fight using these bugs.
 They fully control the bugs and entrust most of the battle to the bugs…
 I hear that they contract to keep giving the bugs their own Chakra
 as food for compensation.
 So he’s…the successor?
 That was unfortunate, Zaku.
 Why’d that happen to Zaku’s arms?
 Probably, that guy called Shino or whatever…
 exploited the opening and stuck those bugs
 into the exhaust opening in Zaku’s hands.
 If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave  in that condition,
 the energy with no way out would expand in search of an exit…
 His arms that are gun barrels blow up…
 and become useless.
 Our relationship was only that of having been given the same mission…
 but... I’ll even the score for you.
 Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed…
 What?! What?!
 So Shino, you were that strong, weren’t you?! Dang it!
 I thought he was a creepy person from long before, but…
 Oh…
 S-Shino, good…work…
 Hey, you did it!
 Yes… I’m counting on you guys, too.
 He comes back like he’s the team leader or something! Dang it!
 Umm, now then, I would like to get right to the next match.
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Yo!
 Not, “Yo!” Kakashi Sensei!
 What about Sasuke? Is he okay?
 Well, he’s fine.
 He’s sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
 However, with Anbu Ops standing as guards…
 Oh.
 Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro
 It’s finally my turn.
 Kankuro, he’s totally underestimating this…
 Humph. Idiot…
 It’s him…!
 Unlike Yoroi, I don’t get careless with kids at all.
 I’ll say this first, once I do my technique…
 give up no matter what…
 I’ll bring it to an end swiftly.
 If so, I’ll also…
 bring it to an end swiftly!
 Now then, please begin…
 the third battle!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I believed in your words the whole time.
 I wanted to be like you.
 I thought it would be nice if that happened.
 So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.
 I’m no longer like I was before.
 There’s no point if I don’t exceed the serious you.

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Sasuke!
 It will be necessary for you to die once…
 Die once, you said?
 Mind Awakening Pill.
 You will take these.
 Mind Awakening Pill…? What is that?
 Your Curse Mark level is at the first state…
 These pills will forcibly stimulate
 the power of the Curse Marks to the second state.
 However, if you move up to the second state,
 the Curse Mark’s erosion will accelerate drastically
 and if things are left that way you will die immediately!
 However…
 In order to control the power of the second state,
 it is necessary to allow one’s body to get accustomed to it
 over the course of several hours.
 In doing so, you will…
 attain power that is equal to ours, however…
 Once awake, you can’t possibly last more than a few minutes…
 and will certainly die!
 Sound vs. Leaf
 Die…and what will happen after that?
 You don’t need to worry.
 That’s why we’re here.
 We will use Barrier Ninjutsu to suppress the side effects.
 We will mitigate that phase
 to ease you from eternal death to a state of half death.
 You really think I can put my faith in your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?
 Master Sasuke…
 We normally function as Lord Orochimaru’s bodyguards!
 We know our stuff when it comes to Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,
 Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!
 I absolutely cannot die yet!
 I’m counting on you.
 Hey!
 We’re gonna lose him if you guys are slow!
 Get into position!
 Begin!
 – Four Black Mists Formation! – Four Black Mists Formation!
 Black Seal!
 All right. We're done for now.
 Man, I’m exhausted.
 I didn’t think this mission would drag on this long.
 I’ll go check out the situation. Let’s go, Raido!
 Right.
 Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.
 There’s one…
 No, two of them.
 Here they come!
 You guys are Orochimaru’s…
 Judging from the direction you came from,
 it appears that you are on your way back from the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 What’s in that barrel?
 Having two Jonin as opponents…
 That’s a tough one.
 Every one of them got the Curse Marks…
 You refuse to answer?
 This will be different from that time before with your surprise attack.
 Shut up, you scum!
 Just drop dead!
 Orochimaru’s toys…
 Don’t you dare monkey around with Leaf Shinobi!
 Those two are really late, aren’t they?
 What should we do, Shizune?
 Let’s go see!
 Right!
 Shikamaru!
 What’s the matter?
 There’s a smell of blood nearby.
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Raido! Genma!
 This isn’t good!
 I can’t believe these two could have been taken down…!
 The best I can do right now is give him some stop-gap treatment…
 Shizune…
 I’m gonna hunt those guys down!
 No!
 B-But…
 W-Wait…lwashi.
 Th-The Jutsu that those guys have is no longer that of mere Shinobi…
 If you pursue them alone, you'll only die.
 Genma…don’t talk anymore!
 The smell of the other two impinged on the five others including Sasuke…
 But the five are moving away from the smell of the blood!
 What should we do?!
 Just as I thought. He has guides.
 This has really turned into a real pain in the neck.
 Let’s hurry up and pursue Sasuke!
 Shut up, Naruto!
 That’s for Shikamaru to decide! Don’t play the boss!
 Shikamaru?
 The fact that there was the smell of blood probably means
 that a battle occurred somewhere.
 If we go to that location we should be able to gather some information…
 We must be attentive as we near the location,
 so we would have to switch over to
 a reconnaissance pattern and approach walking slowly…
 While all that’s going on
 Sasuke will cross over the Land of Fire border!
 What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!
 All right! Let’s pursue Sasuke!
 All right! That’s what I was waiting for!
 However…
 The fact that there was a battle means they’ll have their guard up.
 They’ll certainly be aware
 of the fact that there might be Ninja on their tail.
 In other words,
 the odds are high that there will be traps or an ambush.
 Listen carefully…
 Hereafter, I want you to use your visual and acoustic senses to the fullest!
 We need to locate those guys before we get caught in an ambush!
 And if we come across anything suspicious,
 don't just dodge them, interpret them!
 All right!
 When we find them,
 I’m gonna use my new Jutsu to clobber them!
 That Naruto…
 Each time I see him he’s added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.
 Darn! Just when I thought I had caught up with him…
 Hey! The enemy’s smell is everywhere!
 Everybody! Stop!
 Take a careful look above you.
 Paper Bombs…
 And in five other places too!
 The figuration is that of a Perimeter Barrier.
 Perimeter Barrier…?
 It’s one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!
 Perimeter-type traps have a time lag and are activated
 when one enters the area that has been marked by the enemy.
 It’s advanced Jutsu…
 It was in one of the books that my father made me read.
 Darn! Our only choice is to make a detour…
 Lee… Do what you have to do!
 Lee!
 It’s too soon to be doing that!
 Lady Fifth Hokage!
 I already know that you’re a foolhardy guy.
 But you’ve just had an operation.
 You don’t need to be rushing into things.
 I want to hurry up and do even a little training.
 I also want to… I want to…
 Building your strength isn’t the only form of training.
 Don’t you agree?
 It is said that Ninja are those
 who can forebear and endure any hardship.
 I understand how you feel but…
 That means that this too is one kind of training.
 Training…
 What if you were to do something foolhardy and you got worse?
 Wh-What’s that?
 It’s medicine that I prepared.
 First, drink this and get better!
 Right!
 Come, let’s go…
 Yes, ma’am.
 Damn! Nothing but traps!
 Yeah, but the enemy seems pressed for time.
 The traps have noticeable flaws.
 Hey, hey, Naruto! There’s wire at your feet!
 Don’t trip on it!
 I know that already!
 Wait, Naruto!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 M-Made it just in the nick of time.
 Naruto! I told you to be careful!
 I see… One of the wires is readily visible because it reflects light.
 The other wire has been coated with a matte green.
 So it’s very difficult to see with the naked eye.
 It’s a double trap, huh.
 Despite the fact that they’re in a hurry,
 that’s certainly an elaborate trap.
 Which means that…
 That they’re at rest.
 Perhaps they got injured, or that itself could be a trap…
 Byakugan!
 Caught ‘em!
 All right! All right! I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but I’m gonna demonstrate my new Jutsu right here!
 Me too!
 Don’t be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been made to implement my strategy…
 we’ll make direct contact with the target!
 Darn! When we’re in a hurry, having to take a darn break…
 It can’t be helped.
 When one fights at the second state, one’s body gets drained drastically.
 More than that,
 it’s an ordeal not to be able to use one’s body for a while…
 It can’t be helped with two Jonin-class guys as the opponents.
 If we act in moderation, we’ll be done in.
 Kiba…
 In that event,
 don’t mess up the timing of the Smoke Bombs.
 Got it!
 Now then…
 we'll split up into two teams.
 – Right! 					– Okay!
 It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet.
 Hey, Sasuke's not around.
 It appears that…
 He’s inside that “coffin.”
 Is he dead?!
 That barrel is secured with Barriers. I can't see through it.
 I wouldn’t think that the guys who wanted Sasuke
 would kill him that easily.
 You might be right about that.
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Gimme a break, Shikamaru! You're not reliable in the least!
 And you still call yourself a leader?!
 But this situation sure is a problem.
 Leave this kind of thing to me. lt'll be a cinch.
 – I sure hope it will be. – What do you mean by that?!
 It's too much of a hassle to explain.
 – Shut up, Akamaru! – Shut up, Akamaru!
 What was that?! Give 'em some more, Akamaru!
 Well, if things come to this, I'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something 20	01:01:41:29	01:01:46:07 							Deep Cover?! 		A Super S-Rank Mission
 It could be that way…
 Sure enough, Ichiraku ramen is the best for getting energized!
 One more, Pops!
 Coming right up!
 Huh?
 One more, you said, eh…?
 Just when I thought you’d snuck out of your hospital room
 and were doing some training…
 You guys want some, too?
 Pop, here's the tab.
 Thanks for your business!
 Jeez, I’m fine!
 Naruto, even if it looks like you’ve healed on the surface, you’re still battered.
 It’s not like that! I have to train and get stronger!
 Yeah-yeah, after you’ve healed completely.
 Damn it! I have to keep my promise to Sakura without further delay…!
 Sakura… You’re so pathetic.
 Naruto…This is a… once in a lifetime request...
 Please bring… please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldn’t do it! I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only person who would be able to stop Sasuke…
 who would be able to save him…
 Is you…Naruto…
 All I did…was cry… All I did was totally rely on Naruto.
 I didn’t do anything myself.
 Naruto tried to bring back Sasuke even if it meant his life…
 What can I do for Sasuke now…?
 I just have to put my life on the line and do it!
 It’s futile. The ropes are made of a maiden’s black hair.
 And the knot is a Shinobi reverse butterfly knot.
 It won’t be easily untied.
 Give me a break.
 I have to start training as soon as possible and get stronger.
 Then do as the Medical Corps says and rest quietly.
 Come in.
 Oh…
 Sorry, Sakura…
 I’d like to get moving immediately if possible, but…
 He has astonishing recuperative power, but overdoing it is a big no-no.
 I’m okay!
 Be a little more patient!
 Just wait a little longer! I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!
 No…
 It’s okay…
 Up until now, I was totally reliant on you…
 and I did nothing, so…
 What’s the matter, Sakura…?
 Did something happen?!
 No… I'm was relieved to see you doing well.
 This time, I’ll do my best.
 Sakura…?
 I heard you snuck out of the hospital.
 Do you want to train that badly?
 Pervy Sage…? My…apple!
 Well well, things look like they’re going smoothly.
 Don't you worry. I’ll train you hard right away.
 Umm…about the training.
 I was wondering if you could wait a little while longer.
 Hmm?
 I’m not saying I don’t want to train.
 But I remembered some odds and ends I need to take care of.
 Oh?
 Odds and ends, huh?
 Come on. Please?
 Come in!
 Oh, I’ve been spotted, huh?
 I’m guessing, you want to peep?
 No matter how long you wait, I won’t show anything.
 Wh-Who’d peep at an old lady?!
 N-No, I take that back!
 Actually, I’ve come to make an earnest request to you as the Hokage.
 Talk.
 This time, I’ll do my best.
 It couldn’t be that Sakura’s going to…
 This might be…my last look…
 Sakura…
 How did you…?
 I know what you’re thinking!
 That there’d be nothing I could do even if I were to go…!
 But I hate myself just standing here doing nothing!
 Always being a hindrance to and taking advantage of everyone…
 Not being able to do one single thing respectably…
 It’s useless to stop me!
 I won’t stop you…
 You should do it until you’re satisfied.
 But…I’m going, too.
 But…
 It’s become just the two of us…
 But we’re a three-man squad, right?
 Yeah.
 You guys…
 Oops! Pervy Sage?
 This person…is Jiraiya, one of the legendary Sannin?
 If you, without permission,
 go out past the border of the Village Hidden in the Leaves...
 you know at least that you’ll be sent to prison as Rogue Ninja, right?
 It’s no use stopping us!
 I won’t stop you.
 You’ve been given a mission by Lady Hokage.
 You’re to investigate and report on the Land of Rice Paddies
 where the Village Hidden in Sound is and where Sasuke has been taken away.
 The mission is set to be carried out in a group of three.
 As of now, you will work under me. You got a problem?!
 It seems they’re the biggest of fools.
 They won’t stop even if you tried.
 At this rate, we’ll lose two important subordinates!
 You’ll recognize it as a special mission
 with the goal of investigating the Village Hidden in Sound, right?
 I have no choice, huh…?
 But I have a condition.
 Bring the two back alive. Got it?
 Sure, even if it costs my life.
 It’s too dangerous of a mission even with that Jiraiya going with them…
 Sasuke…
 That’s the Land of Rice Paddies where the Village Hidden in the Sound is.
 It’s that Orochimaru’s headquarters.
 Take sufficient caution and proceed.
 It’s kind of anticlimactic…
 Here I thought a bunch of Orochimaru’s followers would greet us!
 Is this really the Hidden Sound Village?
 It seems to be a peaceful, quiet and nice land, but…
 No, we still haven’t entered Village Hidden in the Sound.
 This is the Land of Rice Paddies.
 Land of Rice Paddies?
 It’s a small land that’s nothing special.
 The feudal lord was a foolish lord who hungered for powerful military strength
 in order to make the land disproportionately larger.
 And then Orochimaru probably won favor with some fast-talking…
 Of course, Orochimaru himself wasn’t thinking about making the land stronger.
 He just had an ambition to make himself stronger and to carry out revenge…
 That’s why there’s nothing in this area that points to his presence.
 Really? And so, Pervy Sage…!
 Don’t call me Pervy Sage!
 That’s right… He’s one of the legendary Sannin, so…
 He’s just a lady-loving perverted Pervy Sage!
 What?!
 More importantly, where’s the Village Hidden in the Sound?
 Beats me… I don’t know…
 What?!
 We don’t know where it is, so we’re going to investigate, right?
 You’ve got a point, but…
 But how do we find it?
 There can’t be a place where people are without food and ladies.
 People gather where there’s food and girls!
 – Where people gather, there's news. – There goes Pervy Sage's bad habit.
 He’s planning to sow his wild oats under the guise of a special mission.
 First off, finding a traveler’s town with lots of hot ladies is the top priority!
 Every land should have a traveler’s town.
 Lodging
 This is a traveler’s town…right?
 Looks like nobody’s living here anymore.
 No, I feel the presence of people…
 And the smell of face powder!
 – Naruto, take it out. – Take what out?
 Don’t act as you don’t know!
 In anything one does, a war chest is necessary, right?
 What! Are you after my wallet? Man!
 What?! This shouldn’t be it! Try jumping!
 Huh?!
 No! Stop!
 One, two, three… Is this all you got?
 That’s all of it, really!
 – Here… 					– Huh?
 It’s not much, but please use it.
 No! Sakura, there’s no need for you to give that to him!
 But, it’s money for gathering information, right?
 Right-right. This should be enough.
 You guys go on ahead to the outskirts of the post station and wait!
 Wh-Why?
 It’s too dangerous ahead from here. lt’s a mission for adults.
 Hmm, the smell of face powder’s from here.
 Welcome…
 Along came a sucker just begging to be parted from his money.
 We should be able to pulverize him.
 Food and Drink! And young women!
 Even if you give the Pervy Sage money,
 he’s just going to sow his oats without gathering any information, anyway.
 Sow his oats…?
 Y-Yeah… I don’t really know about it, but…
 You know, make-out blah-blah-blah…
 It’s fine! lf I can be of at least some help…
 I’m always a hindrance who can’t do anything, so…
 It’s not like that!
 In the first place, if you hadn’t taken the action…
 I’d still be tied to the bed!
 Brothel
 Even in different lands, there are young women everywhere.
 So? Why don’t we move to the room in the back?
 I want to talk more relaxed.
 Nice, nice.
 Then first, settle up the tab for here, okay?
 What, am I already drunk on this cheap drink…?
 Aren’t there like three too many zeros?
 You like to joke, do you?
 If you value your life, leave all you’ve got on you here.
 I see how it is.
 Master Jiraiya’s late.
 I’m sick of waiting.
 Naruto!
 Who’s there?!
 Who’re you?! Are you one of Orochimaru’s followers?!
 What? Was I wrong?!
 Damn it.
 That kid had erased his presence until he’d gotten that close.
 I won’t let him get away!
 Don’t move!
 Wh-Why?!
 Makibishi Spikes!
 Naruto!
 Wh-What?!
 – Hold it! You jerk! – We won’t let you get away!
 Naruto, what’s that?!
 Pervy Sage? What did you do?!
 I’ll tell you later! Anyway, let’s get out of here!
 Why?!
 Companions of the person just now?
 If they’re Orochimaru’s followers, with my Shadow Clone Jutsu, I’ll…
 No, no! Don’t get the wrong idea!
 They’re just bodyguards from a rip-off bar!
 R-Rip-off bar…?!
 First and foremost, this mission has to be carried out in strict secrecy!
 There’d be no point if you were to use Ninja Art and stand out!
 You! Carry the bags!
 The one who’s totally standing out is you, Pervy Sage!
 You have a point.
 This is wrong! Will we really reach Sasuke like this?!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Jeez, this is an appallingly unsettled town.
 Well, you guys wait here.
 Huh? Why?!
 Infiltrating up ahead is too dangerous!
 It’s too much for you youngsters.
 Pervy Sage…
 I myself should be the only sacrifice! See ya, Naruto.
 Blah-blah-blah, trying to look good…
 Your scheme to go into a weird shop again is totally obvious!

96,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Darn it!
 Where'd he attack from?! ls it the clones?
 Where's the real body?!
 It's useless for you to even attempt following with your eyes.
 I absolutely will not be caught.
 Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't!
 This is a teleportation Jutsu that
 uses mirrors that can reflect only my image.
 Watching you from the speed I move,
 it almost seems as if you aren't moving at all…
 I knew it!
 Is that Jutsu… the Kekkei Genkai?!
 Kekkei…Genkai…?
 It's the same type as my Sharingan…
 Then…!
 That's right…
 It's impossible even for me to copy that Jutsu…
 And there's no way to destroy that Jutsu, either!
 Darn it…
 So… What?!
 I can't die here yet.
 'Cause I have a dream that I must turn into reality…
 The dream to have my strength recognized by everyone in the village…
 and become the Hokage!
 Dream…
 I, for the sake of my dream. And you, for the sake of your dream.
 Please don't hold it against me.
 I want to protect someone special to me…
 I work for the sake of that person, I fight for that person,
 and I want to make that person's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 For the sake of that dream I will completely become a Shinobi,
 and kill you guys!
 Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters
 Sasuke! Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like that!
 Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
 What?
 Even if there was a chance that we could break that technique,
 they won't be able to defeat that boy.
 W-What do you mean?
 They don't have the mentality to kill their feelings…
 and kill another person!
 That boy really knows the agony of being a Shinobi.
 He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
 Exactly…
 No real Shinobi will come out of a peace-addicted village like yours.
 Because they are not able to learn
 the most important ""experience of killing""!
 Then…
 Then…
 What are we going to do, Sensei?!
 If I go over to Naruto and Sasuke,
 Tazuna will be in danger.
 Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
 He'll come to stop me with his Water Clones.
 I'll just be wasting Chakra.
 Then...
 I'm sorry but...
 I'm going to have to finish this in an instant.
 Sharingan?!
 The Sharingan again?
 Such an unimaginative guy!
 Sensei!
 You might call me ""an unimaginative guy,""
 but you are afraid of the Sharingan, after all... Zabuza!
 The secret technique of a Shinobi…
 isn't something that you show your opponent so many times.
 Be appreciative.
 You're the only who has had the chance to see it twice…
 And there will be no third time…
 Even if you were able to defeat me, you can't defeat Haku…
 What…?
 Kakashi Sensei can't win?
 That boy in the mask is that strong?
 Since he was a kid, I have been painstakingly teaching him
 the battle techniques of the Ninja!
 All of my techniques.
 On top of that…
 he has been polishing up his own skills as well!
 As a result...
 He has...
 no matter how unbelievably difficult his predicament,
 been extremely successful.
 He has no ""heart"" and has abandoned the notion of ""life.""
 He is a fighting machine known as a Shinobi.
 Not only that, his Jutsu surpasses mine!
 The terrifying ability of the Kekkei Genkai.
 In other words, I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
 Unlike the scrap you're carrying around.
 I'm not one to be afraid just because I failed once!
 I'll do it as many times as it takes!
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Stop!
 W-What the hell is it…?!
 I-It was just slight but…
 I could see the trails of his movements…
 One more try!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Don't you understand that it's useless?
 Just because I see the trail,
 doesn't mean that I can keep up with his speed.
 The water… is being repelled.
 But, what if that wasn't water…?
 All right…
 The next one is going to be my one shot!
 Just because a bunch of scrap got together
 doesn't mean that they can defeat Haku.
 He is…. He is the best tool!
 There's nothing boring than a stranger bragging…
 It's about time… I make my move.
 Now wait. As long as we're talking…
 Let me brag about another thing…
 Hmm?
 In the battle before,
 I didn't just let you defeat me like a fool.
 It's over…
 Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
 was observing part of the battle.
 Haku is quite smart.
 With his ability to analyze,
 he is able to plan a counterattack after observing a technique just once.
 I've been anxious to copy your line.
 ""I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.""
 Was that it…?
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 This is...?!
 What is this…? This really thick fog?
 The visibility is close to zero...
 Sensei…!
 Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!
 That's right.
 I have to trust Sasuke, Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now…
 And I should do what I can do!
 Huh?
 Oh! Sakura!
 Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,  don't move away from me!
 Yeah… I soo know it!
 I know… 					Zabuza…
 I'll finish them off soon enough…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You just don't learn, do you?!
 What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
 It takes…too long!
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring out the timing...
 I know it's called Hidden Mist, but the fog is way too thick…
 Even Zabuza himself shouldn't be able to see anything...
 Good job on dodging it…
 Just what I expect of Kakashi of the Sharingan...
 He's….
 closing his eyes!
 But…the next time you see me,
 that'll be the end of it all…
 You overrate the Sharingan too much.
 What…?
 You spoke as if you saw through everything, but…
 Why?
 Could it be possible that you can see the future…?!
 You are going to die.
 Your foresight was wrong, after all.
 Kakashi...
 You can't read my mind or my future...
 The Sharingan is merely a diversion that makes you believe that!
 Those who have the Sharingan...
 possess both perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes…
 Using these two powers and bringing out Jutsus one after the other..
 you were just acting as if you can read the future!
 First with the perceptive eyes, you copied my movement right away.
 And this is the Image Replication Method.
 You first got me in a ruffle with it…
 Once you make sure that I'm flustered,
 you nail the ""heart's voice.""
 – This is the Mind Imitation Method. – It's only an imitation, after all.
 – You can't defeat me! You monkey! – You can't defeat me! You monkey!
 That imitating monkey mouth...
 I'll make sure that you won't be able to open it any more!
 And…
 You judged the right timing when my frustration was reaching its height
 W-What is that?
 You set a clever trap.
 Me...?
 You used the Genjutsu with your hypnotic eye and
 made me weave the signs first...
 This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
 The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Then that makes it easier.
 First vanish into the thick fog,
 and make your perceptive eyes useless….
 Huh?
 Darn! The guard is falling behind!
 I will close my eyes as well!
 I will shut off your ability to use your hypnotic eye
 in a close-distance battle.
 Why?
 That also means that you will lose your ability to see.
 Did you forget...?
 That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
 a technique to find the target just by sound.
 He read my movement... No way could he do that.
 Darn! We were so close!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent… and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him, I found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah!  Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 What?
 Run out of here and attack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to...!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limit to that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that, he's little by little…
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while since I've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calm… Think... What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 Why? Why is it?
 Why did this happen?
 I never asked for your help! I hated you!
 But you…
 Darn! I won't forgive you!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run the fields in search of an advantage.
 Open the series of Heaven and Earth, and the perilous way shall be redressed…
 This is namely the secret of “the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Huh? What’s this?
 A man…?
 A person…?
 This is…a Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto! Sakura! Let go of the scroll!
 Oh...
 Wha--?!
 Y-You…
 Hi!
 It’s been a long time.
 Surviving the Cut! The Rookie Nine Together Again!
 W-What’s going on?
 It appears you guys have had a rough time of it.
 What?!
 Why are you appearing with a Summoning?
 At the end of this second exam,
 we Chunin are to welcome the test-takers.
 I just happened to be given
 the important task of being the messenger for you guys.
 Messenger…?!
 Just in time.
 Everyone…
 Congratulations on surviving the second exam.
 To celebrate your passing,
 I’d like to treat you to some Ichiraku ramen, but…
 Ohh... Cool!
 Uh-oh…
 H-Hey, Naruto!
 – Listen to the end… – Cool! Cool!
 Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!
 I’ve done great job! I’m the greatest!
 I so want to eat ramen! Believe it!
 He’s got so much energy.
 Yaaaay!
 Shut up!
 Man, that scatterbrained part of you is the same as always, eh.
 I see.
 Huh?
 If we had looked at the scroll in the middle of the exam,
 what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
 Sasuke, you’re a sharp one, as usual.
 You guessed right.
 The rules of this exam were to test your conclusive mission execution ability.
 To put it simply,
 in the case of the scrolls being opened contrary to the rules…
 In the case of them being opened…?
 I was ordered to knock unconscious the test-takers in front of me
 until the end of the exam.
 Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.
 Kabuto, thank you!
 Phew!
 That was seriously close…
 Oh yeah, Sensei!
 Huh?
 By the way, what’re the letters on that wall?
 They’re kind of vermiculated and
 we don’t understand their meaning at all.
 Never mind, never mind!
 We passed!
 No…explaining that is one more of my duties.
 What, really?
 I’m saying that’s right.
 Give it a read.
 These are Chunin instructions Master Hokage recorded.
 Instructions?!
 That’s right!
 Heaven in this text refers to the human head.
 Earth refers to the human body.
 No kidding…
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 In other words…
 If your weaknesses are inside your head, Naruto…
 learn various logics in preparing for your missions.
 Hah! So meddlesome!
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run through the fields in search of an advantage.
 If your weaknesses are in your physical strength, Sakura,
 it means you must not slack off on your daily training.
 And if you combine both Heaven and Earth…
 Any perilous mission is the right way…
 In other words…
 what can also be called a rule of might and become a safe mission.
 Then, what about the spot with the missing letter?
 The letter refers to Chunin.
 The one letter for “person” that was in the scroll from earlier goes there.
 These five days of survival were to test
 the test-takers’ fundamental abilities as Chunin.
 And you guys cleared it in fine style.
 Chunin is of unit-leader class.
 They have the responsibility of leading a team.
 Be more deeply aware of the necessity of physical strength…
 and knowledge in missions!
 I want you to take on the next step,
 never forgetting these Chunin instructions.
 That is all of the messenger task I was given.
 Got it!
 Huh?
 But, as for the final third exam, don’t push it too far.
 Especially you, Naruto.
 – You’re the biggest worry… – Iruka Sensei.
 From when I received the Leaf headband,
 I was no longer an Academy student, you know?!
 There’s nothing to worry! Believe it!
 Also, this is the proof you gave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!
 That I’m scatterbrained may not have changed,
 but I’m not a kid anymore!
 I'm now...
 A Ninja!
 I see.
 I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I know their strength the best.
 If it’s futile anyway,
 I would like to give them the final word personally.
 If you’re that hung up on it, I can leave that team to you.
 To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…
 Thank you very much.
 But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?
 If he’s the one who recommended them,
 I thought I could count on them.
 Stay out of it!
 They’re not your students anymore. They’re my subordinates now.
 The one who might truly understand
 the strength of these kids. might be you, Kakashi.
 How is it?
 Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
 No.
 Thanks to you, it’s gotten quite a bit better.
 Anyway, Orochimaru is one of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
 He’s a S-rank bingo book rouge Shinobi
 who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?
 I heard that he’d already died, but…
 Why’d he come to this village now…?
 There’s a kid I want, you see.
 This kid inherits the abilities of the Uchiha clan, so…
 It's...
 It’s probably Sasuke, right?
 Huh?!
 Master Anko!
 Twenty-one second exam finishers have been confirmed.
 As for the third exam, according to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
 preliminaries are planned for the first time in five years.
 The second exam is over.
 For the time being, continue the exams as is,
 but while keeping an eye on his movements.
 Yes…
 First off, congratulations on finishing the second exam.
 There were seventy-eight test-takers for the second exam.
 To think twenty-one have made it this far.
 I said to make it less than half, but I’d really thought about single digits.
 I’m hungry!
 There are still this many remaining?
 This is such a major pain.
 Sasuke and others have passed, too.
 Of course…
 We went to that much trouble to save them…
 It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.
 Your team didn’t do too bad.
 I guess they were lucky.
 But as long as my team is around, they can’t go any higher.
 After all, whether you like it or not,
 ability talks at the next barrier.
 Well, adolescence can sometimes be bittersweet and
 can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…
 Did you say something?
 Oh my God!
 Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
 But that part of you is so hip... which is what annoys me!
 So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?
 Guy Sensei totally loses visually…
 Guy Sensei is the hippest of all the teachers!
 He shines!
 Okay!
 Please watch, Guy Sensei! I’ll shine, too!
 I don’t ever want to see tears of those dear to me again.
 So…
 I won’t ever lose again!
 Guy Sensei.
 Sure enough, the outstanding candidates have gathered.
 Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
 I’ll get you back for my arms, Sasuke Uchiha…
 At any cost.
 To think a mere seven teams are left of the twenty-six…
 Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
 Akamaru’s acting strange…
 Those Sand Village guys…
 Naruto passed, too.
 Thank goodness…
 What, all the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 Say! Say!
 Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
 It feels like everyone’s assembled.
 Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.
 To think this many are left…
 Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…
 So that’s why they fought  in recommending them.
 Now then, we will now have the explanation of the third exam
 from Master Hokage.
 Listen carefully, everybody!
 Now then, if you will, Master Hokage.
 All right.
 Before the explanation of the third exam that we will start from now,
 I have just one thing I want to tell everyone flat out.
 About the true purpose of these exams.
 True purpose…?!
 Why do allied nations conduct the exams on a conjoint basis?
 Huh?
 Raising the levels of the shinobi and friendship among allied nations.
 It won’t do to have the wrong idea of the true meaning of that statement.
 These exams are so to speak…
 So to speak…?
 A microcosm of battle between allied nations.
 What does that mean?
 If we look back on history,
 the allied nations of today were once neighboring nations
 that continued to vie with each other and battle for power.
 In order to avoid a futile crushing of each others’ military strength,
 those nations mutually selected a place to battle.
 And that was how the Chunin Exams originally began.
 W-Why do we have to do such a thing?
 We’re not doing this to select Chunins?!
 There is no question that these exams are to select Shinobi
 worthy of becoming Chunin.
 But on the other hand,
 these exams also provide a venue
 for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride on their backs to fight for their lives!
 Nation’s pride…?
 Many feudal lords and those of prominence from many nations
 who request Shinobi for work are invited to this third exam as guests.
 And, the feudal lords and Head Ninja of each Village
 of the nations will watch your battles.
 If the gap in national power becomes unbridgeable,
 the strong nations are inundated with job requests.
 The requests of nations deemed weak, on the other hand, decline.
 And therewithal,
 we can exert pressure upon each neighboring nation...
 That is to say, just how much military strength our Village is developing and has.
 Even so, why is it necessary for us to fight for our lives?!
 The nation’s strength is the Village’s strength.
 The Village’s strength is the Shinobi’s strength.
 And the true strength of the Shinobi is created only in a fight for one’s life!
 This exam is a place to see the strength of home country Shinobi,
 and a place to display this as well.
 It is because it’s an exam where you truly fight for your life
 that this has meaning.
 It’s for this very reason that your forerunners fought in this exam,
 a dream worth striving for.
 Then why… use the expression “friendship”?!
 I said it at the start, didn’t I?!
 That it won’t do for you to have the wrong idea of the meaning!
 It’s a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’d like to explain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Master Hokage, please allow me, Hayate Gekko,
 who was given the task of judge,  to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 Nice to meet you, everyone…
 Umm, there’s something… I'd like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's the idea? Sudden preliminaries?
 Didn't we just get to the tower? Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
 It's too much for you, Sasuke! Please, drop out!
 You're in no condition to fight properly!
 No matter what you say,
 I'm going to tell the teachers about that bruise.
 Next episode: ""Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!""
 Sasuke, I'm scared.

 As for me… I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 If you die, there will be no dreams, no nothing!
 Just get out of the way! Run away!
 Just like our wager,
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you.
 I…
 I will absolutely not die until I’ve become Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 I-It can’t be…
 The Fifth Hokage! A Life on the Line!
 Rasengan!
 This is…?!
 Way to go, Naruto.
 That Nine-Tailed Fox kid…
 a kid like that, doing a technique like that…
 I-It can’t be…
 He can’t be, really…
 In only one week, that Rasengan…
 You… Even after you received that Jutsu…?!
 I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,
 and before I received the Jutsu I had started healing.
 The reason why Orochimaru favors me…
 is not because of my use of Jutsu or my sense for Jutsu…
 It is because my recuperative power.
 The power to energize cells and make new cells.
 On the other hand… I’ve used up almost all of my Chakra.
 That Jutsu… seems it was Naruto’s last effort…
 Wh-What?!
 I-It can’t be…
 Even with my powers of recuperation, this much damage.
 I don’t…have…enough Chakra.
 Arrhythmia!
 Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters…
 Why did that happen…?
 That moment?!
 At that moment of release…
 did he shred the muscles around his heart…?
 Stop shaking!
 Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.
 Are we really getting a snack? That guy looks like he’s going to die.
 You’re annoying! Be quiet!
 It’s all over…for Naruto.
 I…cut…his heart’s Chakra Network which restores the strength…
 through the Nine-Tail’s Chakra…
 With all my strength.
 In order to eliminate the possibility that he would heal with his own power.
 There's no way he can recover…
 Even with you.
 Shut up!
 I’ll kill you later…
 He’s stopped breathing…!
 Dammit!
 Dammit!
 Dammit!
 It’s dark…
 Dark…
 Why is it getting dark?
 My strength is… Why…?
 What…?
 Don’t die…
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 Don’t die!
 The bet…
 I won it.
 I-It’s impossible…
 “Hokage is…my dream,” eh?
 For the last time…
 For the last time…
 Just one more time…
 I want to bet on you…
 That child, he’s not well…
 Tsunade is a medical specialist.
 Don’t worry, there’s no need to worry about Naruto’s body.
 That’s not what I meant.
 What?
 Your battle is with me, there’s no time to look away.
 Who would have imagined this?
 If that child is found by the Akatsuki, there will be trouble.
 In other words, if I'm to kill him…
 now is the time!
 Shoot!
 He’s aiming at this child!
 Tsunade… You’re the only one I wasn’t going to kill…
 If that child lives,
 there will be trouble in the future on a variety of levels.
 Don’t get in my way.
 This is one child…
 This is one child… I will absolutely protect!
 Trembling at the sight of blood, why would you, one of the Sannin,
 risk your life to protect that Genin kid?
 To protect…
 my hometown…the Leaf Village…!
 To protect the Leaf Village…?
 Because…because…
 this small child…
 is the kid who will become Hokage some day…
 What utter nonsense…
 By the way… to hell with Hokage!
 Only a fool does that job.
 To hell with Hokage! Only a fool does that job.
 The wishes of the two…
 More importantly, Lady Tsunade, your wish…
 Have you forgotten your dream?
 The successive lines of Hokage have protected
 the Leaf Village and and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 Anyone who makes fun of the old man and the Fourth Hokage…
 It doesn’t matter if you are a woman!
 I’ll clobber you with all my might!
 And now, I also will put my life on the line!
 If your life is worth throwing away for a kid like him… !
 Then dying now would be a fitting end!
 All that’s left…is Naruto.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Make it in time!
 She’s still able to move even after I pierced her down to her lungs!
 You mean you’ll still protect that kid?!
 That’s what I said…
 From now…
 I’m putting my life on the line!
 You, half-dead corpse!
 No matter how cool you try to be, your trembling doesn’t stop.
 You can’t get away from the curse of hemophobia.
 And yet, why would you take the blows for that kid?
 Why would you battle for the Leaf?
 No way!
 Tsunade’s trembling has…
 has stopped?
 That is because…I am…
 the Leaf Village’s…Fifth Hokage!
 That sign is?!
 Lady Tsunade has conquered her fear of blood,
 but that’s…
 What are you saying you’ll do, after all this time?
 You can’t fight with that wound even if you’ve conquered your fear.
 W-Wait! I’ll treat that wound. So don’t release that seal!
 Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!
 Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!
 What is this Jutsu…?!
 It looks like I’m not the only one who develops new Jutsu.
 What in the world is this Jutsu?
 Well…
 For many years I’ve stored Chakra in my forehead.
 The mass of Chakra stimulated a variety of proteins.
 The number of times my cells divide speeds to a dizzying rate…
 The cells rebuild…
 and all the organs and body systems are revitalized.
 It’s not the ability to restore, it’s the ability to reincarnate.
 That means I won’t die…from battles.
 But the number of times a person’s cells divide in their lifetime is fixed…
 If that is sped up, it essentially shortens the life!
 Lady Tsunade!
 That action is…
 Lord Orochimaru!
 Come out!
 Hurry!
 Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!
 – Summoning Jutsu! – Summoning Jutsu!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 The time to conclude this long, fateful confrontation has come, Orochimaru.
 You have sunk too deeply into vice.
 You are no longer a comrade!
 Comrade? How odious.
 That word makes me shiver.
 I will bring you down!
 Today is the last day that we are called Sannin!

 Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is all about Passion!
 It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Naruto? Were you alone on a mission this time?
 I just went to deliver Grandma Tsunade’s letter…
 Is that so? Then you should report to Lady Tsunade right away.
 I know!
 I’ve only been away for a week,
 but it seems as though an awful lot has changed.
 DOJO CHALLENGERS, COME THIS WAY 		That sign wasn’t here before, either.
 Dojo challenge?
 MAKE-OUT VIOLENCE 3
 This way?
 This is a tight squeeze.
 Is that it?
 PASSION DOJO 		“Passion Dojo."" 		Who on earth built this?
 I’ve been waiting for you!
 Huh?
 You’ve come here for a Dojo challenge, right?
 Well, then. Come at me from anywhere you like!
 Huh? Bushy Brow?
 If you don’t make a move, I’m coming at you!
 What? Wait, hold it.
 Hey, it’s me! lt’s only me, Bushy Brow!
 Naruto!
 Hey, that was close, I tell you!
 So the first Dojo challenger will be you, Naruto!
 Well, I couldn’t wish for a better opponent!
 Huh?
 I’m going to go at this for real!
 W-Wait just a minute!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Here…
 So you just came to view the grounds?
 Then you should have said so in the first place.
 I never even got a chance to tell you. You just suddenly attacked me.
 I’m really sorry about that.
 Say. Is this Dojo yours, Bushy Brow?
 Yes. I have been working on it for quite some time
 and finally completed it 6 days ago.
 This flyer was distributed not only in Hidden Leaf Village,
 but in all the nearby towns and villages as well.
 You don’t say?
 I’ve been away on a mission and have only just returned…
 Is that so?
 But why a Dojo?
 It’s all for training.
 For training?
 Well, actually, I’ve been busy with missions lately
 and have not been able to set aside as much time for training as I’d like to.
 And even on those occasions when I was able to take time out…
 it was difficult to find practice partners, so I wasn’t able to train efficiently.
 Just when I was wondering what I ought to do about it
 YOUTH 		I saw something in a village 		I visited on a mission…
 I request a challenge!
 Please come this way.
 Okay…
 I have traveled near and far in search of training…
 I’d like to have a practice match.
 But if I should win, I’ll claim your marquee.
 A Dojo challenge, huh? Very well, I shall have a match with you.
 Here I come!
 If I were to open my own Dojo,
 someone with confidence in his skills will surely come to challenge me!
 So, I opened the Dojo thinking it would give me good practice,
 but nobody has come to challenge me yet…
 Hmmm… Is that so?
 Say, since you’re here, Naruto, won’t you try out for a Dojo challenge?
 If you win, I’ll give you the sign I painted myself.
 I have no need for such things.
 Don’t say that! Please, by all means!
 C-Come to think of it, I forgot to report to Grandma Tsunade!
 I’d better go right away!
 See you later!
 Naruto!
 Please be my first!
 Damn it. I wasted so much time thanks to Bushy Brow.
 Grandma Tsunade scolded me to bits.
 I’d better steer clear of Bushy Brow’s Dojo for the time being.
 What’s that I hear about Lee’s Dojo?
 Intense Brow Sensei…?
 Naruto, what do you mean by that?
 Do you mean to tell me that he opened a Dojo to train himself
 while I was away from the village on a mission?
 Splendid, if I may say so about my own student!
 I, Might Guy, am impressed and moved!
 But the all-important Dojo challengers are yet to appear… Not a single one.
 Damn those Dojo challengers!
 To think that Lee’s earnest hopes have come to naught…
 I’ll search high and low and give them a hit they can not forget!
 But, if you do that,
 you’ll just make even less people want to visit for a challenge.
 Ah, that’s right… Whatever shall I do then?!
 I’ve got it. If no one come to challenge his Dojo, then…
 Why don’t I myself go to Lee’s Dojo, disguised as a Dojo challenger?
 I’ll play the part of Lee’s first!
 A perfect disguise, if I do say so myself.
 He wouldn’t dream that this was me, no way.
 Here I come, Lee.
 Guy Sensei!
 I finally found you.
 If it isn’t Sakura! What is going on?
 Guy, forgive me for bothering you when you’ve only just returned, but…
 an emergency relief request has come in from Shikamaru’s squad,
 which was assigned to transport unit duty.
 We know nothing whatsoever about the true nature and scale of the enemy.
 Therefore…
 there is a possibility of this developing into something major
 if we err in our initial encounter.
 Judging from reports, they should be around here.
 They’re close by.
 First, you go reconnoiter to confirm the situation.
 If they seem to need additional relief, I will make immediate arrangements.
 Yes, roger that.
 Can that strange getup have some significance?
 I don’t know…
 What’s with that strange fellow?
 Well, no matter. I’ll borrow his form
 to infiltrate Leaf Village.
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves’ secrets…
 I, Nanafushi, shall investigate every last detail!
 Was that guy really looking for a Dojo challenge?
 Yeah. That’s what he claimed to be, so there can be no doubt.
 He says he came because he saw the flyers.
 I wonder if he got lost or something…
 Intense Brow Sensei, how long do you intend to keep us waiting?
 Naruto, I think, after all, I’d like to have you be a Dojo challenger…
 Oh no.
 I’ll go look for him!
 Naruto!
 Let’s work up a youthful sweat with me!
 Oh, he returned after all.
 I knew that get up would be problematic.
 What? 					What’s the problem?
 Huh?
 Sensei…? What’s with the strange disguise?
 Everyone can still tell it’s you!
 I…I didn’t think it was such a great idea, either.
 What’s the matter?
 Don’t tell me these guys have discovered my true identify!
 Intense Brow Sensei!
 Sensei!
 Oh!
 Quit lollygagging and get over to Lee's Dojo!
 Huh?!
 If you don’t go, then I’ll have to fight him! Come on!
 Be seeing you…!
 I guess you could say…
 That’s typical of him…
 I’m safe thanks to this guy…
 I should attach myself to him for a while and scope out the situation in the village.
 What is this place?
 This is Lee’s Dojo!
 But, really… Couldn’t you have come up with a little better disguise?
 Well, never mind!
 Lee must be tired of waiting, so try to do a good acting job!
 Acting? What is he talking about?
 I’ve brought him with me, Bushy Brow!
 I’ve been waiting for you…!
 Well then, please try to take down my Dojo!
 Huh…?
 Please come this way!
 Um…um.
 At time like this, you're supposed to say, “I request a challenge match,” right?
 I-I see…
 I-I request a challenge match!
 Do I hear that familiar call? You indeed are a Dojo challenger!
 Fair enough! If you win, you can have my marquee!
 Could it be that I’ve been mistaken for a Dojo challenger?
 Oh my god…
 Huh?!
 He’s just a kid…
 Well, it can’t be helped. I’ll go easy on him…
 Okay! Here I come!
 – Ready! 					– Huh?
 He disappeared?
 Huh…?
 Wh-What happened…?
 This little brat…!
 Take that! And that! And this! And that!
 He's strong!
 What’s going on?!
 I know you’re only acting, but you’re still giving him too much of a break, Sensei.
 Oh, I see. He’s not fighting back because it’ll ruin his disguise!
 Even if I had nine lives, I’d never survive this fellow…
 I think I’d better wave a white flag and withdraw here.
 I-I concede…
 Then that means…I did it!
 I splendidly fought off my first Dojo challenger!
 No, that’s not it at all!
 What he means by “concede”
 is that he concedes to be a Dojo challenger, right?
 In other words, he’s just been warming up,
 and now comes the real challenge, right?
 No, that’s not it at all!
 So that's what you meant, after all…
 I thought it was odd that
 that an experienced Dojo challenger would surrender.
 It’s not odd! There’s nothing odd about it at all!
 Well, then, I’ll have to really get down to business now, too!
 What?! You mean you haven’t even really gotten started yet?
 Hey! Intense Brow Sensei is a pretty good actor!
 He’s even taking more hits so that Bushy Brow won't know it's him.
 What? You were only attacked by monkeys?
 They were after the snacks that Choji procured
 but the important load is safe!
 My snacks… by a monkey…
 Ino mistook that for an enemy’s attack
 and sent out an emergency relief request.
 But, it was so sudden!
 Anyway, it’s your fault for procuring so many snacks!
 These snacks were available only for a limited time,
 and moreover, only available in the Land of Tea,
 the Super-rare “Green tea Pork-flavored” chips!
 For a lover of snacks, it is the ultimate sin to refrain from buying
 a limited offering of snacks once one has found them!
 Like I care about stuff like that!
 What?
 What?!
 Shikamaru, things are tough for you, aren't they?
 Right back at you. That getup… Did something happen?
 Huh? What about my getup…?
 Here.
 Oh, that’s right! I haven’t got time for dallying here!
 I’ve got to get over to Lee’s dojo!
 Just wait for me, Lee!
 You’re overdoing on purposefully getting beaten, Sensei…
 Is he finished now?
 Whoa, hold it! Time out!
 Fight back a little, will you?!
 It’s impossible, I tell you.
 If Lee doesn’t find this challenging enough,
 I might get stuck being his opponent.
 Actually…
 It’s been one extreme mission after another lately,
 and I haven’t gotten any sleep at all…
 What? You don’t say…
 If I got a little rest, I think I might recover, but…
 While I take a rest, won’t you be his opponent for a while?
 What?!
 I’m begging you!
 Wh-What is that?
 I’m coming, Lee!
 G-Guy?
 I thought he already entered the village a while ago…
 S-Sorry to keep you waiting!
 You've weathered such an attack and you're still undamaged…
 You’re quite a fellow!
 The world is vast…
 To think that such an awesome Dojo challenger exists!
 It was worth building this Dojo!
 There’s no way I could win with only Taijutsu!
 If that’s the case, then I’ll fight my own way…
 Here I come!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 But, of course! He’s well acquainted with Ninjutsu too!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 The real body is… right above me!
 Primary Lotus!
 Is this a clone, too?
 Got you!
 Here I go, one more time!
 Another Shadow Clone?
 Nope…!
 Stop it, Lee.
 S-Sakura?
 – Be nice, now! – Don’t be too hard on me.
 – Please! 					– Don’t be mean!
 So many Sakura… Guy Sensei! I’m moved!
 I’ve never known such happiness before in my life!
 – Cha! 					– Cha!
 Wha…?!
 We did it!
 I guess I forgot… that this is a fight with a challenger.
 Just as one might expect… But I won’t fall for the same trick again!
 Even though they may look like Sakura, they’re really just phony Transformation!
 How can you say that, Lee?
 Hurry back, Sensei!
 For brats, they fight such a high-level fight…
 – Leave it to Village Hidden in Leafs… – How about this?!
 I wonder if the rumors that
 – they lost its vigor were just lies? – In that case…
 – I guess I need to – Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 investigate this further…
 This disguise is problematic…
 I get a feeling I will be embroiled in trouble again.
 Let’s go with this. Well then, shall I be taking my leave?
 Hold it right there!
 The real thing!
 I see that you are Rock Lee, master of this Dojo.
 Oh no. I guess I’ll have to play along with him…
 Yes, indeed. I am Rock Lee, master of this dojo…
 I am a Dojo challenger!
 Rock Lee, I shall defeat you and claim your marquee!
 Here I come!
 You fight a pretty good fight.
 You, too…
 H-Help!
 B-Bushy Brow?!
 Dynamic Entry!
 A-Another Dojo challenger?!
 Intense Brow Sensei! What took you so long?!
 N-Naruto…what's the meaning of this?
 If you can’t dodge even this much of an attack,
 you are not worth all the talk!
 Your training is inadequate!
 N-No… This is… I mean…
 It’s about Million years too early for you to be building your own Dojo!
 I must straighten that spoiled attitude of yours with my own fist!
 Forgive me Lee… lt’s my whip of love!
 So, the true identity of the challenger was you, Guy Sensei!
 What? You’re Lee? Then, who was I punching?
 Who’s that guy?
 Good grief…
 Come in! 					Oh, it’s you, Guy…
 And you’re with Naruto and Lee.
 That’s perfect. I was just about to call you all.
 Has something happened?
 Just now, some intelligence came in…
 A Shinobi from the Land of Valleys, by the name of Nanafushi,
 is said to have been seeking inside information on our village.
 He may already have infiltrated the village.
 I want you to go search for this Nanafushi immediately and capture him…
 Oh!
 That man…
 You have an idea of where he might be?
 – It’s this guy! – It’s this man!
 I don’t really know what’s going on… but our mission is complete!
 Well then, we’ll be going.
 Hey! Don’t just leave him here!
 Oh! Guy Sensei!
 Explain what happened! Hey! Lee! Hey! Naruto!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 In the small hours of the morning when the trees and grasses are asleep
 and the forest is deathly calm…
 A signpost standing forlorn starts telling of the destruction of a clan.
 Suddenly with a strike of thunder, heavy rain begins to fall down.
 What could be the true identity of the Iron Castle that appeared?!
 Next Time: “The Mysterious Curse of the Haunted Castle”

100,"Here we are, here we are, here we are!
 “The Golden Time”!
 Starting tonight, “NARUTO” will be airing every Wednesday, from 7:27 at night!
 – Leader… Leader… – For those who always watch ""Naruto,""
 and also for those who are watching for the first time, please enjoy!
 Now, the new opening theme song,
 ”HARUKA KANATA (Far Beyond)” is about to start!
 Listen here! Leader!
 W-What is it Konohamaru? I was just getting into it…
 It’s only 7 o’clock.
 What?
 You’re 27 minutes early.
 This is actually the time slot for “The Prince of Tennis.”
 W-What?!
 W-W-What are we going to do?
 – I already did the greeting! – It’s not my problem…
 I don’t care any more!  I’m going to start “NARUTO”!
 Hey, Sakura, Sasuke.
 Naruto went ahead and started the program.
 Are you ready?
 No, no! I’m still in the middle of my facial!
 What about the VTR for the main show?
 It hasn’t arrived here.
 I guess it can’t be helped.
 I’ll have to do some dancing…
 Nah! I mean I’m going to get the VTR.
 In the meantime, you guys will have to fill up the time.
 What?!
 I’m depending on you. This is your mission.
 Huh, a mission… all right!
 All right, we’ll do it!
 Hey, Naruto!
 This is all your fault for being so careless! You have to learn your lesson!
 Ouchh….
 Go Go!
 Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 W-What? Where is this place?!
 Restricted Area Do Not Enter
 This is the site of the second exam, the 44th Training Field...
 Also known as... the Forest of Death.
 Forest of... Death?
 Huh?
 Is that supposed to be... a rock?
 Moreover, on top of the grass?
 Hey, Konohamaru! What is it that you want?!
 Just what I expect from the man I respect!
 Good job on figuring it out!
 Hey! Too much gunpowder used!
 With an adult sexiness!
 I’m Moegi of the senior class at Kunoichi preschool!
 I love factoring! 					Udon!
 The most brilliant Ninja in the village! Konohamaru!
 The three of us together are the Konohamaru Gang!
 Here we are!
 What’s going on you guys?
 Hey, I’m about to take the second exam for the Chunin Exam.
 I have no time to be playing around with you guys!
 We didn’t come to play around!
 That’s right! We came here for an interview!
 That’s right…
 Interview?
 Yeah, we were put in charge to write the feature article for the “Chunin Exam,”
 for the academy’s class newspaper.
 So that’s why we came to interview you, leader…
 Please cooperate with us.
 Please.
 But...
 Hey, over there!
 What are you doing?!
 Konohamaru here is asking about an interview for the class newspaper…
 Oh, I forgot that Lord Hokage was mentioning something like that.
 Hey, hey…
 All right, take a 10-minute break starting now!
 For those who will be interviewed, resign yourselves and be courteous.
 Hey, hey… What’s this all about?
 Big brother Naruto! I’m depending on you.
 All right!
 In that case, I'll just show you how attractive I am!
 Special Report: Live from the Forest of Death!
 Chapter of Character Introduction
 Please introduce yourself.
 Okay!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
 A Ninja from Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 My hobby is to play pranks, and I love ramen noodles,
 I’ve just become a Genin but…
 My dream is big, to become a Hokage!
 And I’m going to surpass all the Hokage from the past,
 and make everybody in the town acknowledge my existence.
 I’ve been called a failure and such, but I graduated splendidly and,
 as a member of Group Seven led by Kakashi Sensei,
 I am dealing with difficult missions every day!
 Distance from the target?
 5 meters.
 I’m ready anytime.
 In Group Seven, there is also Sasuke and Sakura.
 Since I’m really the only one that shows great success,
 you don’t worry about the other two.
 I got you!
 Don’t say such things. lntroduce them properly!
 Is the target correct?
 I know, I know.
 The target confirmed.
 For example, this guy’s name is Sasuke Uchiha
 and he’s a pretentious guy.
 I heard that he’s one of the last remaining of the famous Uchiha clan,
 but he really is a pitiful guy, like this…
 Oh, this was when I transform but...
 as long as you understand the greatness of my Ninja skills that’s all that matters.
 Oh, and this is Sakura Haruno who is in love with me.
 You know, the more she denies it, the more I’m convinced it’s true.
 She hardly tells me how she really feels about me but,
 her shyness makes her even cuter!
 Is that true?
 It really is true, true.
 Who’s in love with Naruto?! Cha!
 It was a lie after all!
 I’m sorry…
 Well, putting that aside, three of us formed a team
 and got through a bunch of dangerous missions together.
 Hey you…
 What?
 Oh, Missus!
 I’ve gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What? 					What's wrong?
 Those…those aren’t weeds…
 Huh?
 Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!
 Somebody! Help…!
 No!
 Free Fall!
 You idiot.
 Trap Field Do Not Enter 		Don't go over there!
 Hey! 					Please stop!
 That fool…
 Geez... All because he stubbornly chose that big dog.
 This is a dangerous mission?
 It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.
 Yikes !
 Well, there were times like that too.
 Do it over.
 Transform!
 Oh, this was when I defeated the Old Man Hokage.
 This isn’t going to make a good article.
 Fine, then you show me how to do it.
 Fine! My name is Konohamaru…
 The grandson of the town’s chief Hokage.
 Grandfather is the most important figure in the Leaf Village
 and is the third Hokage.
 Those who succeed the Hokage name is the top Ninja of the village.
 Especially the 4th Hokage is a great hero who protected the village
 from the demon fox!
 Hey, hey, hey wait!
 You’re only talking about other people!
 I was just about to start on myself!
 Besides, Bro, you talk too much about yourself!
 Of course, I am the star of the article, other people don’t matter!
 You’re right, Naruto…
 Of course, you’re going to forget about me
 when you graduate from the academy.
 But you can introduce me for a bit…
 Oh, yes, yes…
 He is the first person in the town who acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei…
 He’s a really nice person,
 he always treats me to ramen noodles at Ichiraku.
 Am I just a nice person because I treat you to ramen noodles?
 Oh no…well…that’s…
 Don’t laugh it off!
 Big brother, next up, I’m depending on you!
 Oh, you’re right!
 Then, I guess I could talk about Sasuke’s stories of failures…
 I’ve already heard that one. Get more serious!
 That Naruto…!
 I bet he's just making up stuff as he pleases…
 Humph!
 Who cares…
 This is good-looking Kakashi.
 How is the situation over there?
 This is cute Sakura.
 Naruto is somehow managing to fill up the time.
 More importantly, how is it over there?
 Are we going to make it in time?
 We’ll be able to deliver by the end of the commercial break, I think.
 Oh and don’t forget to tell the viewers about the present.
 Roger that.
 Kakashi Sensei… Kakashi Sensei, please respond.
 I wonder what happened?
 He said that he’d be back by the time the commercial ended.
 It can’t be helped. Sakura, you have to continue.
 What, me?!
 Sakura do your best!
 Why are you there?!
 Well, it can’t be helped, I guess I’ll have to do it.
 Chapter of Ninja Art
 Well, now we’ll have Sakura Haruno,
 who is my senior as a Kunoichi, teach us about Ninja Art.
 Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi, Sakura Haruno.
 Beautiful?
 What, you have any complaints?
 Oh, no…
 Transform!
 Well first, Naruto’s Ninjutsu...
 Sexy Jutsu,
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Transform!
 - Transform! - Transform!
 - Transform! - Transform!
 Harem Jutsu…
 I call it, “Harem Jutsu”!
 And something like this.
 Hey!
 It’s his fault that he’s late!
 Dropping the blackboard eraser…
 Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,
 who graduated as the top student at the academy.
 You won’t get me by attacking straight on.
 The most popular one in class, he can also fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.
 Sasuke is awesome!
 Your Sasuke introduction is taking too long.
 Naruto, you're so noisy.
 Stay quiet.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 What?!
 That’s not a Jutsu Genin can use…
 He couldn’t have enough Chakra!
 Demon Wind Shuriken Windmill of Shadows.
 Shuriken won’t work on me.
 I’ll do it.
 C-Could that be…?
 Sharingan!
 Is that, the Sharingan…?
 If this is the same Kekkei Genkai as Kakashi Sensei’s…
 he can read Bushy-Brow’s Jutsu!
 Genjutsu or Ninjutsu… it’s some kind of magic either way.
 I’ll reveal that!
 Although you have seen Sasuke using powerful Jutsu like
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu, Demon Wind Shuriken,
 Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,
 the greatest of all is...
 the sharp look of his eyes!
 Any girl who has been stared at with those eyes,
 will fall in love with him!
 Sasuke! 					Look this way!
 You’re... annoying.
 Well, that cold behavior is also another attractive quality of Sasuke…
 Next is our teacher, Kakashi Hatake Sensei,
 also known as the Copy Ninja Kakashi.
 He uses the Sharingan in his eye to assess the enemy’s technique
 and copy over a thousand Jutsu techniques.
 But he’s always late to meet people, and whenever he has any time
 he always reads this questionable book called Make-Out Paradise,
 and he always looks like he doesn’t really care about things…
 Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:
 A Thousand Years of Death!
 And the biggest mystery of all is his face hidden under that mask!
 I wonder what he really looks like…
 Ninja Art, Summoning, Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 If you can’t use your eyes or ears, simply use your nose.
 That’s what happens when you’re closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsu specialized for pursuit.
 On top of all that, why does he have the Sharingan in his left eye
 that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?
 One mystery after another when it comes to this person,
 so many things that I don’t understand…
 I should ask him next time I have the chance.
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is… visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Water Prison Jutsu.
 Oh no!
 Secret Jutsu.
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 Next up are the Ninjutsu of the other Ninjas besides us.
 There’s such a diverse collection of Ninjutsu that I have no time to explain all…
 Chapter of Rivals
 Please, Sasuke, whom I feel is like my future self,
 take care of the next part.
 Sure. After all, I have be the one to do something about it.
 I knew that from the beginning.
 Don’t try so hard to look cool.
 Sasuke, the snob.
 Don’t interfere.
 Stay out of it, loser.
 Annoying.
 Shut up!
 I hate the fact that only you stand out.
 Nobody strong around you shows any interest in you.
 What the…?!
 Just watch this.
 Hey!
 You there… What’s your name?
 I’m Gaara of the desert. I have an interest in you as well…
 What’s your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Hey, you there. ldentify yourself.
 Dang it! Again? It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name, give your own name first.
 You, with the unpleasant look.
 Wait a minute!
 Why don’t you fight with me here now?
 I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
 The one I want to fight isn’t you… lt’s Uchiha.
 Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke! lt's annoying!
 It’s true!
 Nobody thinks that you’re the main character leader!
 That’s not true, they’re all just blind!
 Huh… As usual you’re just about the talk and not the walk.
 That’s not true!
 Leaf Whirlwind!
 See, you are just about the talk.
 Uhh… even Sakura is picking on me.
 The students who gathered for this Chunin Exam are all skilled,
 and are the cream of the crop…
 Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi, lno Yamanaka,
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru, and Shino Aburame…
 You won’t never be able to win with the way you have been fighting.
 You must understand that, right?
 Y-Yeah! Of course!
 You, too. Be careful not to let your guard down
 so you won’t be defeated by some lame guy!
 Huh! Of course!
 That’s right…
 We passed the first stage of the Chunin Exam and
 are heading to the location of the second stage…
 No matter what kind of adversity may lie ahead,
 we will not be afraid!
 And we will pass the exam to become a Chunin!
 Because we... we...
 have the greatest teamwork that was formed by a strong bond!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Thank you so much for cooperating with the interview!
 – Thank you… 					– Leader!
 Do your best!
 Yeah leave it to me!
 – Bye! 					– See you!
 – Do your best! – Good luck!
 Oh guys… I’m sorry I’m late.
 A cute girl started talking to me on the way, and I danced for a bit.
 And that’s a lie!
 Well, don’t say that…
 I did bring the VTR like I said.
 You have to praise me.
 Yes, Kakashi Sensei you’re great!
 Now we can see the rest of the show!
 Everybody look forward to it!
 Oh, before that the commercial break…
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The 44th Training Field, also known as the Forest of Death.
 From here on it’s a serious battle between the Ninjas,
 anything could happen!
 It’s going down in earnest now!
 This is getting interesting!
 A life-risking survival game in the forest!
 I will survive without fail!
 Next time: “The Chunin Exam Stage 2: The Forest of Death!”
 As for me, I’m going to kick butt again!

 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.

 Master Jiraiya…I believe in you.
 The Summoning Jutsu: Wisdom of the Toad Sage!
 Well well…
 You don’t sleep at all?
 What do you want?
 I thought I’d crush you now.
 If I do that, there’d be the possibility for me,
 after the first battle, to be able to fight Sasuke.
 I know your Sand attack.
 I wonder which is faster, yours or my Sound.
 In the full moon…
 in the full moon, his blood boils.
 W-What the heck…are you?
 Amazing… So that’s his true form?
 But…is it okay? He’s a Sound Ninja …
 It’s all right. He’s long since served his purpose.
 I thought he was a guinea pig in order to see…
 the power of the boy called Sasuke or something…
 Why…is he with the Sand Ninja?
 No, that’s not necessary anymore…
 Actually, I’d already been ordered to seize Sasuke.
 But I failed…
 What did you say?
 That’s right.
 …for the likes of you?
 Are you looking to take me on?
 You willful little brat… Don’t mess around with grown-ups.
 Don’t be so arrogant. The situation is in my favor.
 It’s also been found out that I’m a minion of the Sound.
 Then…if they find out that you’re having a secret meeting here with me…
 the plan to destroy the Leaf Village and everything will be for naught!
 I heard… that you’re Orochimaru’s right-hand man.
 Being revealed to them and coming nonchalantly to meet with me…
 You must be a fool.
 Well…to be exact, my true identity wasn’t found out…
 I let them find out.
 I wanted to see how far the Leaf Village would go…
 Even after that it wouldn’t be too late to seize Sasuke.
 If you guys are going to fail, we’ll back off immediately…
 It’s a plan that was originally posed by the Sound, so.
 The Sand is invisible until the last moment.
 This is the will of the Kazekage.
 Holy smokes…
 That’s fine.
 This is the carry-out plan from Sound.
 Okay.
 And please…tell them about this plan soon.
 Yeah.
 I know.
 Okay, I’ll be going.
 To think our allied nation, the Village Hidden in the Sand,
 has been already associated with the Sound…?!
 I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.
 Oh, by the way…
 I’ll take care of the clean up.
 No, I’ll do it…
 As the member of Sand Village of the Land of Wind,
 I must do what I can for my allies…
 Besides…it’s just one mouse.
 It’ll be easy.
 Well well, it’s Mr. Proctor.
 What in the world are you doing here alone?
 It seems I have no choice,  but to fight.
 Leaf Style…
 Crescent  Moon Dance!
 I can’t pull it out.
 This technique is… the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.
 Being able to manage it at such a young age.
 As expected, this village is full of talented Ninja.
 Your talent with a sword is superb.
 But, a real sword with substance can be stopped.
 However…a Wind sword can’t be stopped by anyone.
 Take that!
 That does it!
 Nice, nice.
 Hey…
 This is paradise.
 Hey, I said.
 Isn’t it time for you to turn this way already?
 If you join my training, I’ll give you lots of “service.”
 P-l-e-a-s-e.
 So you finally came out… I was waiting for you.
 What?!
 Are you making fun of me?
 Right back at you.
 I’m hungry.
 Let’s get back to the inn.
 Owww, darn it!
 Okay…I’ll teach you a technique.
 Do you really mean that?
 Do you remember what I told you yesterday about the two types of Chakra?
 Huh? Yesterday’s talk?
 You know, what you said about blue and red Chakra or something.
 Oh… What about it?
 You said that when a great power came out, you felt red Chakra.
 Yeah, it was like that.
 Try building up that red Chakra right now.
 Hmm. Even you say so…
 I’ll give it a try, but…
 How about it?
 Hmm, it’s not right.
 It’s the same Chakra as always.
 Jeez, you have no talent.
 Don’t be talking all high and mighty!
 In the first place,
 I really don’t understand those two types of Chakra myself!
 Just keep trying.
 Humph… So he doesn’t understand it… himself, eh.
 It seems Naruto himself still hasn’t realized that
 the red Chakra is the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra.
 Well, guessing from his story…
 it seems the excitement of danger and heightened emotion
 are the key to summon the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.
 No good, not good.
 Only the usual Chakra’s coming out.
 Say, Pervy Sage…
 What the heck does the red Chakra and the technique you’re going to teach me
 have to do with each other?
 Listen, boy.
 For the technique I’m about to teach you,
 the Chakra you’ve had until now is not nearly enough.
 Therefore, you’ll have to able to pull out and use the “other” Chakra
 that has been dormant within you at any time you need.
 But how do you know that I have such a Chakra?
 Oh, just what I wanted to hear.
 Actually…
 it’s because I’m a sage.
 Jeez…that’s no answer.
 Anyway, the special Chakra that only you have
 will become your greatest weapon.
 Greatest weapon?
 Not using that is like wasting treasure.
 There’s no need to forcedly do the same training as everyone else.
 Everyone has what they’re good at and poor at.
 You have your own style.
 Your training until now, maintaining and releasing a set amount of Chakra,
 was in other words,
 training to control the suppression of Chakra so that you wouldn’t get exhausted.
 But you who have a lot of stamina
 should be about power rather than a cheap trick.
 You, who has two types of Chakra and doesn’t exhaust easily,
 should release the largest amount of Chakra you can
 and train to increase the absolute amount of Chakra that you can use.
 Then there are tons of Jutsu and techniques you can use.
 What, for example?
 For example…summoning Jutsu that I’m going to teach you now.
 Summoning?
 Right.
 It’s a type of spatio-temporal technique
 where you sign a contract in blood with all kinds of living creatures
 and summon whenever you like with Ninjutsu.
 Oh! That sounds awesome. Teach me quick!
 Before that…
 first, it’s necessary to use up all of your usual Chakra.
 Okay!
 Leave it to me.
 Well… So you can use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 I have a good idea how to get rid of my Chakra quickly.
 Well, you’ve multiplied quite a bit.
 Listen up. We’re going to have a battle royal now.
 The last one left will be the strongest me…
 We’re going to determine the me among me!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 I see. Good thinking considering he’s stupid.
 Okay, let’s go!
 My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.
 The finale is near at last.
 Well done.
 Sure enough, I’m the strongest me.
 It looks like you’ve finally used up almost all of your Chakra.
 Now, at last I’ll teach you the technique.
 Oh, I’ve been waiting!
 First, I’ll show you.
 Watch carefully.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Ooh, so cool.
 Open that scroll.
 It’s a contract with the summoning toads
 that I’ve taken over from generations.
 Sign your name in your own blood
 and stamp the fingerprints of one hand in blood under that.
 Then build up Chakra in the place you want to summon
 and set down the hand you contracted.
 The Sign is Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.
 Okay…This is fine, right?
 It’s easier for you to release red Chakra right now.
 So give it a try.
 I already am.
 Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.
 Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.
 A tadpole…
 This kid…has no talent, after all.
 Hayate…what in the world happened?
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Ino! When I was going to visit Sasuke at the hospital by myself…
 why are you coming along?
 Besides, what is that flower all about?
 A ""rose for love""? That's so lame.
 I chose this daffodil for him, hoping Sasuke will get better soon.

102,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Naruto!
 There was an emergency transmission from the training room!
 What in the world happened?!
 Actually, the star was stolen.
 The enemy is a Ninja who flies using Chakra!
 No way…!
 I’ve never heard of a flying Shinobi.
 Byakugan!
 I lost him…
 But what Naruto said is true.
 To think he can fly using Chakra…
 That’s an incredible Shinobi.
 So it was true.
 What?! You didn’t believe what I said?!
 You could say that.
 Wh-What’s up with that?
 Do I have that little credibility?!
 The Remembered Lullaby
 So the star of the Village Hidden in Stars
 is a meteorite, huh?
 Yes…
 The First Hoshikage…
 That’s what they call the village leader.
 He discovered that if you train by the “star…”
 Chakra is strengthened.
 Ever since then…
 the Hidden Star has been in a unique position
 even among the Ninja hidden villages.
 But it says in these documents
 that the training hasn't been conducted these past ten years…
 The leader who called himself the Third Hoshikage
 prohibited the training…
 But about a year ago…
 It seems they started again after that Hoshikage died…
 But why? Why do something like prohibit training…?
 Who knows…?
 It’s a classified matter of the Village Hidden in the Stars, so…
 But there were various rumors circulating around about it…
 Rumors?
 Yeah… Rumors about most of the Ninjas who trained dying…
 Chakra is forcibly strengthened by the power of the unknown star.
 There may have been adverse effects on the body.
 What…?
 The star was stolen?!
 Yes! The people who were training were at the scene,
 but they were all knocked out by an enemy Jutsu…
 Pathetic!
 You say that, but that Ninja had incredible Chakra!
 Naruto, is it that incredible?
 Yeah! Turning Chakra into monsters or wings.
 It’s the first time I ever saw that!
 Is that true…Sumaru?
 Yes!
 It’s the Ninja Art: Kujaku, no mistake!
 That’s the Jutsu passed on in the Village Hidden in the Stars, huh?
 Yeah… As for that Jutsu, only those who have mastered the star training can…
 Sumaru!
 Tenten…
 The secrets of a Jutsu are not to be spoken of or asked about lightly.
 Especially with a Jutsu that can only be passed on to those of that village…
 I’m sorry…
 Lord Akahoshi, please give me an order!
 The star being stolen is my responsibility.
 No…
 The star was stolen
 even though we were commissioned a mission to protect it.
 It’s also our responsibility.
 We will get the star back by our own hands, no matter what!
 Yes… I will leave the search for the star to the Leaf Shinobi…
 Sumaru, you keep an eye on your injured comrades.
 But only those in the village know village matters…!
 It’s an order!
 Hey! Are your friends who got beaten up by the enemy Ninja okay?
 That’s none of your business!
 What…?!
 At the end of the day, you’re still Ninja from some other village!
 You’re not my friends or anything!
 What’s with him?!
 Neji, you’re talking about taking responsibility,
 but we haven’t even seen the scene of the theft.
 That’s right… And we don’t have any leads.
 No, we do.
 You didn’t pick up on it?
 Akahoshi the village leader knows something!
 What do you mean by knowing something?
 Come to think of it,
 when Sumaru was talking about the Kujaku something or other,
 his expression changed.
 Then that means the culprit is someone associated with this village?
 So, like I said, what does this mean?!
 I’ll make a go around the village
 and look for something that could make for a lead.
 Lee and Tenten, you keep watch over that village leader called Akahoshi.
 I understand!
 Leave it to us!
 I don’t get it! What the heck should I do?!
 Let me see… You investigate from Sumaru’s angle.
 All right! Leave Sumaru to me.
 Then, I’m off for a run!
 Same as always…
 Naruto sure is an impetuous person, isn’t he?
 ♪ Natsuhiboshi, why are you so red?
 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed
 Swollen as I cried…
 Natsuhiboshi, why've you lost your way?
 I'm searching for a child who has gone afar
 My sad dreams come once more. ♪
 Hey Sumaru!
 What’re you doing?!
 Nothing! I was just looking at the stars!
 Stars?
 Come to think of it, you can see the stars well in this village.
 That red star’s sure pretty…
 Natsuhiboshi…
 It watches over me all the time…
 Huh?
 H-Hey… Hold it. I want to go visit your friends.
 Look, here…
 I’ve brought the Hidden Leaf specialty Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly!
 Go if you like! lt’s right near the training room!
 Huh?
 A cold-hearted guy as usual…
 What? Is nobody here?
 Sorry to bother you.
 Where is everyone?
 Oh, is somebody sleeping?
 Stop it… Hokuto.
 I can tell… He’s not an enemy.
 Mizura…!
 You little! 145.01	01:35:28:21	01:35:32:04	Oh, ouch…
 A girl…?
 Who are you?
 I’m a Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Leaves, Naruto Uzumaki!
 I came to this village to protect the star !
 Y-You are…?
 I’m sorry for my rough behavior!
 It’s cool. I just came to visit…
 Where’s the Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly…?
 Oh! That’s it!
 Oh, no!
 There’s no mistake…
 Then it was that person who made off with the star, after all…
 So you’re saying that one’s still alive…?
 Then this will be difficult.
 That one being the final Ninja completely trained
 in the power of the star means…
 Not an opponent we can handle with the likes of our Jutsu!
 Don’t get flustered…
 If the culprit is who we think it is,
 we already hold that one’s weakness in our hands.
 I get it…
 Then let’s grab that person up.
 Wait…
 First we must avert the eyes of the annoying flies!
 I’m sorry… My name is Hokuto…
 I felt Chakra from someone not of this village…
 I carelessly…
 Well, the flavor won’t change, so eat up.
 Okay…
 Oh my… It really is good!
 Right? Right?
 Say… What happened to the others?
 The thief just put us to sleep…
 There wasn’t such a great deal of damage.
 I see.
 You okay?
 Thanks for saving my butt back there!
 Is there something wrong with you?
 No…nothing at all…
 After Mizura began the star training, he started to feel poorly…
 Hokuto! Don’t be talking about the star
 to someone from another village!
 Are you okay, Mizura…?!
 I’m sorry. I got carried away…
 Other village… You guys are kind of cold-hearted.
 Especially that Sumaru guy…
 I’m sorry…
 But there’s a reason why Sumaru became like that.
 What?
 It happened ten years ago…
 Sumaru’s parents who were protecting the star
 were killed by Ninja from some other village…
 who came to steal the star.
 So probably, he’s…
 So that’s what it was about… That’s why he got like that.
 So where is Sumaru…? And where the other guys?
 It seems everyone went to take back the star.
 Huh?!
 Oh!
 Naru…to?
 They’ve come out.
 Right…
 We should take them on fair and square here…
 Idiot! There’d be no point to surveillance!
 I’m not much one for sniffing around secretly.
 Be quiet. They’ll notice us!
 Leave the trailing Ninjutsu to me… Follow me quietly!
 But…
 It’s a mission!
 I understand…
 Let’s go…!
 Secretly, secretly…
 It’s okay… They haven’t noticed.
 But I get the feeling this kind of thing goes against my Way of Ninja…
 Don’t complain!
 Secretly, secretly…
 You don’t need to say secretly, secretly!
 But is this really a trailing Ninjutsu?
 Uh-oh…
 Have we been noticed?
 Wait…
 It appears we weren’t noticed…
 Let’s continue trailing them!
 Right! They turned right!
 R-Roger!
 They vanished…
 Did they give us the slip?
 Could it be, they noticed us?
 Wait…! We’re not enemies!
 That’s right!
 We came here on a mission from the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Oh-ho, Leaf Shinobi, you say?
 Then aren’t you guys trailing the wrong people?
 That might be so.
 But there’s the possibility that you guys have transformed
 into people from this village, so…
 Brave words.
 I apologize for the rudeness…
 But now the star has been stolen.
 And we don’t have any leads…
 So that’s why you were investigating us, huh…?
 That was unnecessary…
 Oh well… We will take back the star with our own hands.
 You guys just make sure you don’t get in our way!
 They kind of tick me off…
 But it’s as Neji said…
 It seems there’s some kind of secret in this village, eh?
 Seems so…
 Everyone…join hands!
 Listen up! Pick up the same star Chakra as us!
 There he is!
 You can’t cut a rope woven with Chakra!
 Give back the star! That’s our life!
 Neji, have you seen Sumaru and the others?
 You weren’t keeping watch of him?
 Actually, it seems most of the guys went out to look for the star.
 I see…
 Hey… is it okay to be all relaxed?
 Hey, is something wrong?
 There’s massive Chakra at the Valley of Death.
 Did he appear again?!
 Let’s go!
 All right!
 G-Give back our…star…
 Give it back…
 Hold it!
 Eat this!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 Damn you!
 Wait!
 Let me go! Let me go, I say!
 Calm down!
 Up ahead is the valley filled with poison gas…
 O-Okay…
 You would’ve been dead meat in a few seconds without that mask on…
 Damn it. We almost had him.
 So that was the Shinobi who stole the star?
 Yeah! Absolutely no doubt about it!
 Why? Why is it necessary to go out of his way
 to take Sumaru away although he carried out his goal already?
 Does that have something to do
 with the star being targeted ten years ago?
 At that time, it seems Sumaru’s parents got killed protecting the star.
 What?!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 We need to reinvestigate the village leader and his relations.
 Please leave it to me! I’ve got an ace strategy.
 A strategy?
 I can’t count on Tenten’s trailing Ninjutsu, can I?
 What did you say?!
 Do whatever you want. Just follow through with it.
 All right! Here I go!
 We’ll see how good you are.
 Then, me, too…
 Hold it, Naruto.

 This man Jiraiya does not fall victim to any woman’s allurement,
 but rather his forte is winning women’s affections!
 You were totally excited by a lame tactic like a woman winking at you!
 You shouldn’t be the one to try acting all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!
 Like I said, don’t call me that in front of people…
 Be quiet…
 More importantly these people aren’t normal, Pervy Sage!
 Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!
 Like I said, don’t call me “Pervy Sage”!
 You are, after all, Master Jiraiya, one of the legendary Sannin…
 I didn’t believe that I’d be able to stop you so easily
 despite the fact that you are a huge womanizer.
 What?!
 You know the true identity of Pervy Sage?!
 Well no, that’s not necessarily who I really am…
 Seems like you released the Genjutsu that we had put on that woman.
 You shouldn’t call yourself a man for using such a cowardly tactic
 like casting a Genjutsu on the woman with your hypnotic eyes
 to separate me and Naruto.
 Separate us… Why would they do that?
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You are after the Nine-Tailed Fox in Naruto…
 No wonder Kakashi knew that as well…
 I see clearly now. The information source was you.
 To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority placed by our organization, Akatsuki!
 What’s going on…?
 I can’t let you have Naruto…
 I wonder about that.
 This is perfect… I’ll get rid of you two right here!
 Don’t butt in…
 The one that’s going to kill him is …
 Me!
 Hate Among the Uchihas: The Last of the Clan
 Sasuke…
 Revenge, I see…
 Right now, I have no interest in you…
 Don’t mess with me!
 Sasuke!
 Darn you!
 Naruto! I told you not to butt in!
 I told you before…
 I’ve lived only for this very day… for this very day!
 Sasuke…
 Not yet…
 You can’t even make a hand sign together at this point…
 This is…my battle!
 Fine.
 Wha--?
 You heard that didn’t you?
 This is their battle. Let’s not bother with it.
 Fine then!
 Wh-Why…?
 Our power difference hasn’t changed at all since that time…
 Why is that?
 He doesn’t show any mercy.
 What have I… been doing all this time?
 Whatever have I…
 You are weak.
 And you are weak…
 because you don’t have enough hate.
 This place is…
 This place is… Could it be?!
 That's right.
 This is our house.
 Dad! Mom!
 You are weak.
 For the next 24 hours…
 Stop it…
 Relive that day.
 Stop it!
 Uncle! Auntie!
 You’re not even worth killing. Foolish younger brother…
 If you want to kill me, begrudge me! Hate me!
 And keep on surviving in that unsightly manner…
 Just continue fleeing and fleeing and hang onto your life!
 Hasn’t changed at all…
 Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realm on your own little brother.
 Stop it already! You!
 Wha--?!
 Th-This…
 Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!
 How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.
 You guys are already inside my stomach!
 I summoned the esophagus of the giant toad
 of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.
 You guys are wanted criminals anyway.
 I’ll turn you guys into fodder for the stone toad.
 What?!
 Wh-What is this?
 Naruto, you stay still!
 Don’t worry, it’s my Jutsu!
 Come here, Kisame!
 Oh!
 Darn it!
 It’s useless!
 There hasn’t been one person who has been able to escape from this!
 A wall of flesh is charging at us!
 The wall is faster.
 At this rate…
 Hey…
 Pervy Sage!
 What’s the matter?!
 Huh!
 They’ve gone!
 I cannot believe that this wall has been torn through…
 Why must we retreat? You would be…
 We have no reason to rush to get Naruto in the current condition.
 Besides, I have to rest my body somewhere for a while.
 Not just Tsukuyomi,
 but he also made me use Amaterasu as well…
 What is this fire?
 It’s black…
 Don’t get so close!
 How did those guys manage to get out?
 Not only that…
 What are these black flames?
 The stone toad who has the ability to blow fire had its intestine’s burned…
 Huh…?
 All right!
 Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!
 All right! It’ll be okay for now.
 Now for Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…
 Dynamic…
 Guy?!
 Entry!
 Well… Eh…
 I’m sorry to have kicked you so directly.
 I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror…
 I used this headband instead, but it was hard to see.
 And I assumed this rough-hewn face was the enemy…
 I just let the flames of the burning juvenescence take over me…
 I’m sorry!
 Is that … supposed to be an apology?
 I’m a simple-minded guy just like how my face looks.
 It doesn’t really matter.
 More importantly, we have to get Sasuke to the Medical Team!
 Yes!
 He’s broken his arm and ribs.
 Not only that, he’s lost consciousness
 from some kind of mental blow he received from the Visual Jutsu!
 This boy also experienced that Jutsu…
 Hey Pervy Sage! ls Sasuke going to be all right?
 Seems like he’s received a significant amount of mental damage.
 I’m going to kill you!
 Die!
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way!
 Darn… Why?!
 What did that guy do to Sasuke?!
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 We’ve gotta change our plan!
 I got scared earlier,
 but this time I’m going to chase those black-capes and get them!
 It’s me that they want, right?!
 Then, I’ll be the one to make my way over!
 Humph, you’re only going to be killed if you go now.
 They’re at a totally different level from you.
 I just managed to get you away from them…
 Then, are we just going to keep running away?!
 Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!
 Shut your mouth for a second!
 You are weak.
 I’m sorry, Guy.
 I thought that I had spared the boy’s feeling, but…
 I should have saved him much sooner.
 Kakashi has also come down with the same Jutsu…
 We don’t know when he will regain consciousness.
 Kakashi Sensei?!
 When my students are hurt…
 I always wish, from the bottom of my heart…
 If that person, who is a medical specialist, were here…
 That’s why we’re going to go find her now.
 What?
 You mean, her?
 Could it be…?
 W-Wait…!
 C-Could this money be…?!
 Yup, that’s right…
 The one who uses the slug and drives illness away,
 and who is also one of the Sannin like me…
 All right! We’re going to turn around our luck with this!
 Princess Tsunade with the letter “Gamble” on her back!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 It’s festival, festival, festival!
 I’m going to spend like there’s no tomorrow!
 Wait a minute, Naruto! I will keep your wallet for you.
 Huh?!
 It’s been said since ages past that three forbidden factors:
 money, alcohol, and women, are believed to cause Ninja failures.
 I am not like you, Pervy Sage!
 All right! I am going to enjoy the festival!
 Next time: “A New Training Begins: I Will Be Strong!”
 Wait. What are we gonna do about my training?

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned

 This is…that lake from before…
 Naruto…
 I see…
 The person who was calling my name earlier was you, right, Chishima?
 Are you hurt?
 I should be asking you that, Chishima.
 You shouldn’t be moving with that injury.
 I’m fine.
 More importantly, we need to find Lady Toki.
 Oh yeah, that’s right…
 Where the hell did that Moso go?
 I’m right here…
 Moso…!
 Lady Toki…!
 Chishima, I’m sorry for having deceived you for so long…
 That’s all right, I already had a sense that maybe…
 You guys know too many of this land’s secrets…
 I’ll have you guys embrace those secrets as you plunge headfirst into hell…
 Is that your real face?
 My name is Hoki.
 I’m a Wandering Ninja.
 I’m not about to let you get in the way of my taking this peaceful land,
 which I have finally managed to snatch!

 Chishima!
 Chishima!
 Please, hang in there!
 Are you…all right?
 I’m so relieved…
 Chishima!
 Lady Toki…
 I have fond memories…
 of playing here at this lake…
 with you and Lord Sagi.
 In those days,
 the Land of Bird was tranquil, gentle and warm…
 Use your strength, Lady Toki… to restore the Land of Birds…
 to the way it was in those days…
 Chishima…
 Hang in there!
 Naruto, I beg you…
 help Lady Toki… help my friend…
 Sure thing. lf a Leaf Ninja promises something,
 he will complete it to the very end.
 Promise me…
 You must… you must… protect Lady Toki…
 You have feelings for her, don’t you?
 That ramen…was delicious…
 I’ll treat you to some again…
 Thank you… Naruto…
 Chishima!
 Chishima!
 Chishima…!
 That guy was nothing more
 than just another convenient servant, after all.
 Shut up!
 He loved the Land of Birds with all his might…
 Chishima, who staked his life trying to protect the country he loved…
 I will not…forgive you, no matter what!
 You may say that you won’t forgive me,
 but what exactly do you think you can do?!

 Die!
 How annoyingly persistent!

 That was careless, Copy Ninja Kakashi Hatake…

 if I take you, who possess the Sharingan, down…
 What…? A Substitution…
 Sorry to disappoint you.
 I don’t need to use the Sharingan on the likes of you…
 This way!
 Naruto!
 If we follow this…
 Yes, we should be able to reach Naruto.
 Unfortunately, I cannot allow you to avenge the blood of the fallen.
 The least I can do for you, out of charity,
 is send you to the same place your father and brother are.
 I don’t care.
 Why don’t you just kill me in one stroke?
 You know when to give up, huh?
 They’re all dead. I’m the only one left in this world.
 Now that I am unable to take revenge,
 I have no more reason to live.
 You’re a courageous girl, aren’t you?
 All right, I’ll grant your wish.
 Resign yourself!
 Wake up.
 Save Toki… Save my little sister…
 I entrusted the future of the Land of Birds to my younger sister
 and gave her the watch.
 But Toki became obsessed with her desire for revenge.
 I, a dead soul, cannot change my younger sister’s heart
 which is stalled in time.
 I’m begging you,
 please make my younger sister’s time begin to move again towards the future.
 What was that just now?
 Die!
 What?
 Hold it!
 What?
 Hold it!
 Naruto!
 I met your elder brother in a dream a little while ago.
 Elder Brother?
 It wasn’t the wish of your elder brother Sagi
 that you avenge his death.
 He wanted to leave the care of this land in your hands.
 But…
 For Chishima’s sake too…
 you must make this Land of Bird a great country…
 That’s why you must live, Toki…
 Naruto…
 It doesn’t make any difference to me.
 The two of you are going to die here in any case.
 Hey, Hoki, you want this Land, right?
 What…
 But a person with an impure heart, with a heart bent on revenge,
 cannot govern this land.
 The reason this was such a wonderful country was because
 Chishima and Sagi and Toki’s hearts were all connected.
 Even if you use dirty tricks to gain status,
 you will never be able to control the hearts of the people…
 Speak for yourself, squirt!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You Leaf Village greenhorn!
 I’ll send you down into hell first to meet up with the others!

 – Damn, which is the real one? – Damn, which is the real one?
 Naruto, hang in there…
 I wouldn’t have thought the real McCoy would come straight out
 when using Shadow Clones…
 I was hoping you’d let me have some fun…
 So that was your caliber, after all, huh.
 Those without power should hurry up and die!
 Better not underestimate me! The battle is not yet won!

 Thank you, Naruto!
 I was just carrying out my mission.
 More importantly…
 Make that guy pay dearly for his crimes, okay.
 Yes.
 I’m sure that Sagi is happy about this too.
 You met…you met Elder Brother Sagi…
 Yeah, in a dream.
 But even if it was in a dream,
 it doesn’t change the fact that he asked me to do something.
 What did Elder Brother say to you?
 Well, he said something about starting up your time again.
 My time?
 He said he wanted you to forget about things like revenge
 and instead live for the future.
 Elder Brother…
 Hey!
 Naruto…
 Kakashi Sensei, Neji, Tenten!
 Gimme a break…
 I can’t get paid my extra money now that Moso,
 the guy who signs the paycheck, got nabbed…
 Come on, resign yourself…
 But…
 It looks like the Wandering Ninja are going to get a really stiff sentence.
 Yeah… And Toki was finally able to break the curse of seeking revenge…
 Hey, it’s gonna start!
 Down on your knees!
 Ohhh…wow…
 I must apologize for having deceived everyone
 by using my brother’s name fraudulently,
 and claiming the title of feudal lord.
 In a case such as this,
 it may well be proper to hand over the title of feudal lord to someone else.
 However, if you will forgive me,
 I would like to ask you to allow me to work
 on behalf of Land of Birds as your lord.
 For my deceased father Owashi, and brother Sagi…
 And for my dear friend Chishima who loves this country so dearly…
 Lady Toki…
 As long as there is breath in my body,
 I would like to work positively to rebuild this country.
 She’s doing an excellent job, isn’t she?
 Toki, awesome!
 As you wish, Lady Toki…
 It appears that you all agree too, correct?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Thank you…
 To Komei…for accepting me as your feudal lord…to everyone…
 And to the young Ninja who taught me
 what it is that I should really stake my life on…
 You’re embarrassing me…
 Land of Birds
 Please take the best of care along the road now.
 Fare thee well.
 Chishima, be nice to Toki, okay?
 Thank you, Naruto.
 Please come back to visit again soon.
 Sure, next time I’d love to visit without a mission.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye. Be well…
 See you…
 Toki…she was really kind and gorgeous too, wasn’t she?
 I’m certain that the Land of Birds will become a wonderful land again,
 just like it was in the old days.
 Yeah.
 By the way, Naruto… did you really meet Sagi’s ghost?
 You gotta be kidding.
 There’s no such things as ghosts… that was all in a dream.
 I’m not so sure it was just a dream.
 Wh-What the heck are you talking about?!
 Do you remember that Cursed Warrior we cornered the very first time?
 Uh, yeah.
 Yeah, he was empty inside.
 Th-This…?
 The inside of it is empty.
 Yeah, but that was just sort of gimmick, right?
 Some kind of string or piece of wire or something…
 No, I definitely saw it with my Byakugan.
 Now that you mention it,
 you said there was no sign of life, right, Neji?
 Yeah…I didn’t feel a speck of life from that Cursed Warrior.
 In other words, there was a ghost there.
 So that was a real ghost, after all?!
 Calm down, Naruto.
 That's not true… That's not true!
 Tell me that’s not true!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love

 Isn’t that right?!

105,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Wait, Naruto!
 I won’t wait.
 I told you not to be acting on your own.
 Then you’re saying to leave Sumaru be?!
 Sumaru just now seemed quite upset…
 He’s definitely intending to get revenge on Akahoshi.
 Now that he’s been tarred with the reputation of Rogue Ninja,
 he’ll have no place to go throughout his life
 if he raises a hand against the village leader.
 Hokuto?
 Mother!
 I finally…
 Here, I finally got to meet you…
 Mother.
 The Star's Radiance
 Wh-What’re you doing?
 Shh! Don’t be acting on your own anymore.
 But, something’s strange.
 This number of Ninja is indeed something serious.
 It seems they’ve mobilized all of the village Ninja.
 Anyway, we should see how things go for a little while.
 Byakugan!
 Sumaru’s inside the training room…
 Hey, what about Sumaru’s mom?
 Damn it!
 Sumaru…
 Do we really have to do away with him?
 He’s still a kid. Wouldn’t it be okay to let things slide?
 At this moment, he’s a dangerous element.
 No good would come of letting him live.
 But Sumaru’s been the most effective Genin in the village.
 We have more than enough materials…
 We can just train more…
 Materials…?!
 I won’t stand for it anymore! Leave it to me!
 – Forget about it. – Let go of me!
 I’m going to kick that Akahoshi jerk’s butt.
 This is a Star Village issue.
 Village issues have to be resolved by those in the village.
 Isn’t there something we can do for him?
 That’s right.
 Let’s charge on in and box Akahoshi’s ears…
 What’re you saying?
 That’d be the same as Naruto!
 Are you saying we must remain idle spectators
 even when things have gone this far?!
 That’s right!
 As long as there’s no commission from the village to kick Akahoshi’s butt,
 there’s nothing we can do.
 Archer unit! Forward!
 Fire!
 Until now, I felt resentment towards you, Mother, for leaving me behind.
 But…I understand clearly now.
 I understand why you had to do that.
 Akahoshi… I will never forgive him!
 Sumaru…
 Wh-What a pitiful mother and son, eh?!
 What’re you talking about…?
 I buried them both together… There is no greater happiness.
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This jerk’s an enemy... He suddenly attacked.
 You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
 I can tell even if you give me the runaround…
 The people from other lands are all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above all of the Hidden Villages.
 Is your awesome Chakra also the power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone have the same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is required to control it!
 I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 I’ll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to working with you at that time!
 I’m also going to become the Hokage someday, believe it!
 You’re a strange guy.
 Really?
 That red star sure is pretty…
 Natsuhiboshi…
 It watches over me all the time…
 Are you still gonna say I should bear it after all this?
 Sumaru!
 Sumaru…
 Listen, everyone.
 If you continue the star training, you’ll all die.
 Sumaru’s mother is the one who took away the star.
 She did that in order to protect everyone’s lives!
 Lord Akahoshi?
 Is it true that we’ll die?
 Are you going to believe such nonsense?!
 Being unable to withstand the star training
 is because the heart that loves the village is weak!
 Those who really love the village can become true Shinobi
 and can also surpass the Hidden Villages of the Five Great Nations!
 Hokuto or Lord Akahoshi… Who’s telling the truth?
 Mizura?!
 In that condition…! lt’s reckless!
 Wait, everyone!
 There’s… There’s something I want everyone to see.
 Mizura…
 What’s that?
 What’s going on?
 Is that the effect of the training?
 How awful.
 Lord Akahoshi… I take pride in the Hidden Star Village.
 Even though it was painful,
 I endured it and continued the star training…
 Even so, were my feelings for the village still not enough?
 Mizura!
 I don’t think there could be lies in that child’s words…and body.
 Yes. So that’s why the Third Hoshikage prohibited
 the star training for a long while.
 We adults got carried away with our feelings for the village
 and may have made the wrong choice…
 You loser!
 Do you intend to mislead everyone and crush the village?!
 What’re you doing, Akahoshi?!
 They aren’t traitors.
 They’re children of our village!
 Protect Hokuto and Mizura.
 Are you going to betray the village?!
 I can’t go along with your way of doing things, Lord Akahoshi!
 Me, too.
 Me, too!
 Me, too.
 Me, too.
 Death to those who betray the village!
 Execute them all!
 Are you insane, Akahoshi?
 If we lost all the children, there’d be no future for the village!
 H-Hey… You’re taking things too far, Akahoshi.
 Take everyone’s feelings into consideration and yield for now.
 Shut up! What’re you doing talking nice now?
 We’ve long since dirtied our hands.
 S-Stop! What’re you going to say?
 Akahoshi, what do you mean?
 There’s a star in this village that no other villages possess.
 I just thought we didn’t need a foolish village leader
 who wouldn’t allow the star to be used.
 What?!
 Could it be that you are the ones who killed the Third Hoshikage?!
 Indeed, there were suspicious rumors concerning the Third Hoshikage’s death.
 Akahoshi, prepare yourself and answer!
 You’ll pay depending on your answer.
 The three of us assassinated the Third Hoshikage!
 It was the quickest way to save the village.
 Say what?!
 You guys are the traitors!
 – Right! 					– Right! Right!
 No, don’t get the wrong idea.
 We just helped a little.
 Idiot. That’ll be an acknowledgement!
 Akahoshi!
 We will not acknowledge you as leader of the village.
 Justice is not with you anymore.
 It is the children who possess the hearts that truly care about the village.
 Everyone! Let us rise together with those children
 for the sake of the village.
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 We’re sorry, children.
 We were completely taken in by Akahoshi’s fast-talk.
 As of now, we’ll fight with you!
 Give it up, Akahoshi.
 We’ve lost!
 Shut up! I haven’t lost.
 Mizura!
 Hokuto… Live for me…
 Mizura!
 Akahoshi, we won’t let you do as you please anymore!
 I won’t let you do something like go against me!
 Have you gone mad?!
 Akahoshi, you’ve lost!
 Give in to justice with good grace!
 I won’t lose!
 The star is now…in my hands!
 The star?!
 I will now become the Fourth Hoshikage!
 Power… I’m starting to brim with power.
 I do not need any training.
 I could have become one with the star if I’d done this from the start..
 What…What’s this?
 What’s that?!
 Byakugan.
 Massive Chakra from the star has poured into his Chakra Network
 and is causing it to go out of control.
 Hokuto!
 I can’t take it anymore! Neji! Hey, Neji!
 Don’t… Naruto…
 No matter what you say, I’ll kick that Akahoshi jerk’s butt!
 You jerk. I won’t be responsible.
 Right. Just say that I butt in on my own.
 L-Lord Akahoshi.
 Akahoshi!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Damn it!
 You jerk.
 Damn you…

 Despite having been assigned a mission to protect the star,
 to think you’d smash the all-important star…
 You didn’t just fail to complete the mission!
 The compensation fee will be massive.
 But Grandma, I had no other choice!
 It’s my fault as the leader for not being able to stop him.
 I’m responsible as well!
 Right. I also…
 Well, that’d be a matter under normal circumstances.
 We haven’t received complaints from the Star Village
 with regard to the incident of the star being smashed.
 In fact, the culprit of this incident
 was the client Akahoshi, the deputy Hoshikage.
 So the mission itself is forgotten!
 Come to think of it, what happened to him?
 It seems the three,
 the main culprit Akahoshi and accomplices Yotaka and Shisou,
 will be punished severely by Hidden Star Village!
 That’s good! Now the Star Village will be peaceful.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, all the Genin from the Star Village have been examined.
 And…?
 If they all receive proper treatment, they will return to good health.
 Hey, what about Mizura?
 Yes. That boy will also be fine.
 Yes! So, where’s everyone?
 They’ve completed their examinations and are heading for their quarters.
 Hey, Naruto! The lecture isn’t…
 He never changes.
 Hey, guys.
 That’s great! Get better, Mizura.
 Right!
 I won’t lose to you.
 Huh, what?!
 I’ll become Hoshikage before you!
 Even without the power of the star,
 I’ll make the Village Hidden in the Stars into a most powerful Ninja village!
 Say what?
 No way will I lose! I’ll become Hokage before you!
 Shut up. I’ll be first.
 I’ll be first, believe it!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Kiba Inuzuka escaped with Akamaru!
 Kiba did?!
 Then, have a Special Pursuit Corps stand by in preparation for the worst.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Hey, just a minute. Then they’ll…
 We have no choice.
 The safety of the residents must take precedence.
 But Akamaru is Kiba’s partner.
 I’m aware of that.
 Then…
 Shut up, Naruto! I have an obligation to protect this village.
 Next time: “Kiba's Long Day.”

106,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Hey, you!
 Are you sure you want to look like that?
 Yes, of course! C'mon! So hurry hurry!
 Don't regret it later.
 Say cheese!
 My Name Is Konohamaru!
 I couldn't decide on how to look.
 It took me 3 hours to decide.
 But as you can see, it's more like a work of art.
 Doesn't it look great?
 Take it over.
 What?!
 Take it over.
 Stop saying that!
 Transform!
 Oh please, Lord Hokage…
 The Sexy Jutsu… That's quite a devious technique.
 By the way Naruto, where's your headband?
 I won't wear it until the orientation. lt might get scratched
 Well, that's just fine.
 But the Ninja Registration Form is a very important document
 held in high regard by our village.
 Why do you want to look like this?
 Because!
 Anyway, how should I know about all that stuff?
 Old man! Get ready to fight!
 I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!
 Ouch!
 If it's not one thing, it's another….
 Drat! Is this a trap?
 Are you okay, Honorable Grandson?
 May I just inform you that there aren't any traps here…
 Huh? What's with this runt?
 What?!
 I know this kid… He's that Nine-Tailed boy!
 He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!
 You must have done this to me!
 You tripped all by yourself, stupid!
 Hey! Let go of him!
 He is the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage!
 He stopped as soon as he learned who I am….
 He's like my four-eyed teacher.
 He's just like everyone else!
 What's the matter?
 Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?
 Can't do it 'cuz I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?
 As if I care! 					lmbecile!
 This guy…
 What?!
 Good grief…
 Listen to me.
 You are the Honorable Grandson of the Third Hokage.
 Even though that scoundrel hit you, you must not associate with his kind.
 Nothing good will come of your tangling with him.
 This is your distinguished teacher Ebisu,
 and I am never wrong about these things!
 Don't you want to become the Fifth Hokage?
 Then allow me to teach you Ninjutsu,
 so that your dream will become a reality.
 That's right.
 Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?
 He's gone!
 It seems he's gone after Naruto.
 Oh no!
 This is terrible!
 Honorable Grandson!
 How did he become like this?
 That was the 20th sneak attack today.
 And now he's in the company of Naruto. I'm a bit worried.
 I just hope he doesn't pick up more foolishness.
 Huh?
 Stop following me!
 What is it now?!
 Your camouflage is pathetic.
 You've seen through my disguise...
 Your reputation is well-earned.
 I will allow you to make me your apprentice.
 But you must first teach me that  ""Sexy Jutsu""  technique
 you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.
 You gotta be kidding.
 I beg you to say yes, boss!
 Huh?
 Boss?
 Boss! Boss! Boss!
 I guess I have no choice.
 Listen.
 In order to become a skilled Ninja,
 you must first learn to control your Chatora.
 Chatora?
 Yes, Chatora.
 Boss, I think you mean Chakra.
 Silence!
 That's what real Ninjas call it!
 Oh! I didn't know that!
 Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.
 Listen. Chakra essentially means…
 Basically, it is the energy needed in order to use Jutsu.
 Huh?
 In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts combine the Chakra,
 the physical energy accumulated from each cell in the body
 with spiritual energy intensified through training and experience.
 This combined energy is summoned with certain hand signs.
 You made me think you knew all that,
 when you were just reading from a scroll!
 Much has been said about perfecting the Ninja techniques,
 but it really boils down to just one thing.
 And what is that?
 Hard work and guts.
 Hard work and guts?
 That's right.
 So be ready for the challenging tasks I will give you.
 Yes, boss!
 Good. Let's start right now. Transform for me.
 Huh?
 Let me see first how much you already know.
 But what do I transform into?
 OK... First, transform into that lady.
 An easy task, boss.
 Transform!
 Well, do I look like her?
 Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…
 And what's so similar about that?!
 Honorable Grandson.
 If you will transform into me, at least try to look a little cuter, OK?
 She's scary!
 Why am I the one who gets hit?
 OK! Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!
 Yes, boss!
 I told you I don't allow reading here, Naruto!
 This is the last test. Put all of your effort into it!
 Yes, boss!
 Transform!
 Naruto! It's you again!
 Why is it always me…?
 Sorry.
 Huh?
 It's because I'm the Hokage's grandson.
 Don't worry about it.
 Huh?
 You're now ready to perform the Sexy Jutsu!
 You just need more practice.
 Yes, boss!
 OK, keep in mind… the point is for ""boom boom boom""!
 Now do it!
 Yes, boss! 					Transform!
 What do you think?
 That won't do!
 More slender.
 Yes, boss!
 Is this okay?
 Not yet. 					More attractive.
 Yes, boss!
 How about now?
 That Naruto… What is he teaching the Honorable Grandson…?
 Where the hell could they be…?
 I am a distinguished teacher training potential Hokage.
 All those who interfere will be eliminated.
 You know I've been wondering…
 You seem obsessed with beating your Grandpa Hokage.
 My name is Konohamaru.
 It was Grandpa who gave me that name.
 He named me after our village.
 It should be easy for everyone here to remember.
 But nobody ever calls me by that name.
 When they see me, all they see is the grandson of Lord Hokage.
 No one sees me for who I really am.
 I can't stand it anymore.
 That's why…
 That's why I want the title of Lord Hokage now.
 Idiot…Who do you think will accept you, huh?
 Huh?
 You won't win the title that easily, you know.
 What?!
 It's not that simple.
 If you're really serious about gaining the title of Lord Hokage…
 What?
 You'll have to beat me first!
 Lord Hokage! I've been looking for you.
 Iruka.
 Did Naruto re-submit his Ninja Registration Form?
 Yes.
 When I lectured to him the other night at the ramen stand,
 he said he will make everyone accept him now that he's a Ninja.
 He's been happy since then.
 It might not be easy for Naruto to realize that dream.
 Huh?
 As you well know,
 only the villagers who fought the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago
 know that the monster is sealed inside Naruto.
 I ruled that no one shall speak about that incident.
 I have severely punished those who have broken this rule.
 Now our children know nothing about it.
 That is the only positive development for Naruto.
 Before the Fourth Hokage trapped the monster and died,
 his last wish was for the villagers to regard Naruto as a hero.
 A hero?
 The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster into the navel of a newborn baby
 whose umbilical cord had just been cut.
 As the receptacle for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 Naruto saved the village.
 Unfortunately, the other villagers don't see him like that.
 Some even say that Naruto is the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.
 Little by little, that attitude has been passed down to their own children.
 Iruka. 					Do you know?
 What, sir?
 When someone is hated and people refuse to accept his existence,
 he sees it in the eyes of the people around him.
 I have found you!
 Huh?
 That Demon Fox!!
 That cold look! lt's always like that!
 Honorable Grandson, we have to go now.
 No way!
 I want to beat Grandpa right now so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!
 Don't get in my way!
 A Hokage must first know about virtue, honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,
 judgment, obedience and all that.
 He must be skilled at more than thousand techniques…
 And then...
 Transform!
 Take this! Sexy Jutsu!
 What? 					lt didn't work!
 What kind of a disgraceful spell is that?!
 I am a gentleman!
 Such vulgar attacks will never work on me!
 Honorable Grandson! That rascal will only make you an imbecile!
 Stick with me and...
 you will gain a shortcut towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.
 C'mon, let's go!
 No way!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 Wow! 					Fantastic!
 Ha! 					That's nothing.
 I am a distinguished teacher.
 I am not as weak as Mizuki.
 Boss…
 Transform!
 Transform!
 Oh, Master Ebisu…
 I call it ""the Harem Jutsu""!
 He combined the Multiple Clones with his own Sexy Jutsu.
 That's another devious attack.
 I probably won't even survive that one.
 I can't even beat that four-eyed teacher of mine!
 I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly! I want to be recognized by everybody!
 But I keep failing.
 You think it's that easy?
 Huh?
 It's given only to the greatest Ninja in the village.
 Everybody must learn to believe in you.
 I've been through a lot already.
 It's been one struggle after another.
 But after all that, I found someone who accepts me.
 I had to go through a lot... Just for one person.
 You had better push yourself.
 For what?
 The path of getting the title, Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.
 There's no such thing as a shortcut.
 If you're really serious about attaining the title of Lord Hokage
 You'll have to beat me first.
 Who do you think you are, lecturing me like that?
 I won't be your apprentice anymore.
 From now on, you're my rival.
 Unfortunately for you, tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.
 Still, I'll consider you an equal someday when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.
 Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.
 You still have a long way to go to become a real Ninja.
 Aaah! Why do I have to be in the same group with Sasuke?
 The guy I hate the most?
 Sakura keeps saying  ""Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!""
 and doesn't even pay attention to me!
 It makes me so mad! I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!
 I'm not gonna let him be so cool in front of Sakura!
 Next Episode:  ""Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?""

107,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 This is good!
 Bit by bit, I'm figuring out the timing...
 He read my movement.
 No way could he do that!
 Darn! 					We were so close...!
 Naruto, can you still move?
 Of course! I'm totally fine!
 He's pretty much spent... and it's no wonder.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 But thanks to him,  we found our way out.
 I found the way to break through!
 Hah! Impossible!
 That was just a coincidence.
 Naruto! Run!
 Run out of here and attack from the outside!
 A-All right!
 You won't be able to…!
 I-I'm not going to lose!
 There!
 Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Darn!
 T-That was good just now!
 What?
 We're doing it one more time!
 All right!
 It's likely that there's a limit to that guy's Chakra, too!
 To prove that, he's little by little…
 This won't go as you've planned.
 First, I'll get you!
 Sasuke!
 Darn! It's been a while since I've fought in such bad conditions.
 And I'm worried about Sasuke and Naruto, too...
 Be calm…Think... What will he come after?
 Oh no!
 What?!
 Too late!
 The Broken Seal
 That was Sakura's voice!
 Did something happen?
 What's that Kakashi doing?
 Sa…kura…
 Darn it… I must do something…
 I'll do something about it…
 T-This guy...
 Here I go…
 It's pointless to struggle.
 Naruto, behind you!!
 Naruto!
 It's impossible for you to get out of here.
 I mean it.
 Can you stand up, Naruto?
 Y-Yeah…
 From now on, don't waste your Chakra!
 You're playing right into his hands.
 I know.
 Darn it!
 If things continue like this, it's going to be really bad.
 I...
 I have to do something.
 Strangely, my eyes have adjusted…
 It's about the time I put an end to this for you…
 What?!
 Stand up, you idiot!
 I'm aiming for a vital spot... but he's parrying all of them .
 I know… you're so persistent!
 A coincidence… No, that's not it.
 On the contrary, he's fighting while covering for his friend.
 Surely, my movements…
 That boy…he can see something.
 What in the world...?
 Okay, in that case...
 He disappeared.
 Where, where did he disappear to?!
 Naruto! Don't faint!
 I can't take care of you any more than I am now!
 Who asked you to take care of me...
 It seems that kid has reached his limits.
 Tsk...
 Amazing… That's an amazing move.
 You move well…
 Wha--?!
 But I'll stop you with the next one.
 Motor function...
 Reflexes... Ability to judge a situation...
 All of these things… should be at their limits!
 He's coming!
 Calm down…
 Focus!
 And … 					See everything!
 He saw through absolutely everything?!
 No way…
 Those eyes…
 It can't be…
 Sharingan…
 You are…
 Only a little, but...
 I was able to see!
 So, you also have the power of Kekkei Genkai…
 What a kid…
 It's not perfect yet,
 but to think that in the middle of a battle he was able to rouse this power…
 If that's the case, I can't fight him too long…
 This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
 There are also limits to retaining the teleportation speed.
 Besides, the longer the fight continues,
 the more my movements will enter into the range of his ""reading.""
 In fact, his eyes have already captured me.
 It would be foolish to aim straight at him.
 In that case…
 I'll use that kid to lure him in!
 What?!
 Let me make it in time!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 You were late entering to guard, Kakashi.
 Your whole-hearted intent to help those kids has gone to your head,
 and it seems to have clouded your Sharingan
 with even heavier fog.
 Even though you have those impressive eyes,
 your ability to read your enemy's movements is getting cloudy.
 Amuse me more, Kakashi…
 I want to repay my debt in an amusing way.
 Don't worry. Anytime now, Haku is going to defeat those kids.
 You better apologize to them in tears
 when you are in ""the next world"" for your lack of strength.
 Sasuke will be defeated…?
 That's not true!
 Sasuke is…
 Cha!
 Not by that guy!
 Cha!
 He won't be defeated!
 Cha!
 Naruto won't either!
 That's right.
 Huh!
 I...believe in their strength.
 Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive, Knucklehead Ninja…
 And Sasuke is a member of the most excellent clan
 in the Hidden Leaf Village!
 That can't be!
 Yes… His name is Sasuke Uchiha…
 He bears within his body...
 the famous Kekkei Genkai of the Uchiha clan!
 He's a Ninja genius.
 He's the remaining survivor of that tragic clan?!
 No wonder he grows so quickly.
 But...
 That's the same as Haku.
 Nobody has ever beaten that secret Jutsu of Haku's
 Not one person in the past…
 Well then…
 It's about time I settled this too, huh.
 Sakura, don't move from here.
 Uh... ah…okay!
 No, I'm going to put an end to this!
 For God's sake, you…
 just won't quit… dragging my feet, will you?
 You did it! 					Sasuke...!
 W-What kind of expression is that…
 You…idiot…!
 W-Why?!
 You protected me…?!
 How the hell…should I know?
 Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!
 Hmph…
 You...
 I hated you…
 Why? Why…?
 Why…me…?
 I didn't ask for your help!!
 I don't know…
 My body moved…of its own accord…
 Fool…!
 Sasuke!
 That man…
 Until I defeated…my brother…
 I absolutely refused to die...
 That's what I decided, but...
 You, don't die…
 He…
 To protect someone dear to him…
 he would plunge in knowing it was a trap…
 He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.
 Is this the first time you faced a friend's death?
 This is the way of the Shinobi…
 Shut up!
 Even though I... hated you too…
 I won't forgive you…
 I'm going to kill you!
 What is this Chakra?!
 It can't be…
 For Chakras to be tangible like that…
 A-And…what a ghastly Chakra that is…
 The wound on his hand… lt's healing instantly…
 This boy…
 Who in hell is he…?
 Is it Zabuza…?
 No!
 This sinister Chakra was once…
 It can't be!
 What is…this Chakra?
 It feels foul…
 Kakashi? No, it's too big to be Kakashi's…
 Who is it?
 Naruto…!
 Oh no…
 At the time like this…
 The seal has broken…?
 I have to hurry!
 He's coming!
 How dare you!
 You ruined Sasuke! Damn you!
 Sasuke's dream…
 What about dream?!
 Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!
 Because of your dream…!

108,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Follow My Lead! The Great Survival Challenge!
 I-I’ll do my best!
 Looks like it’ll be interesting, huh, Konohamaru?!
 Here…Here…
 Heck no, heck no! No way in heck, believe it!
 Why should I have to do some babysitting mission like that?
 I don’t care what you say, Old Lady Tsunade. I refuse!
 The team organization has already been announced to the students!
 I don’t care about that!
 As for me, I want to train more, get stronger and…
 “I’ll become Hokage someday, believe it,” huh?
 A person like that…
 would never betray the expectations of his adorable juniors, would he?
 Become a unit leader and issue appropriate instructions…
 Protect the lives of your men and promptly carry out your mission…
 I thought this mission I’m giving you guys…
 is ideal practice for becoming Hokage.
 Ideal practice for becoming…Hokage?
 If you’re going so far as to say that, then it can’t be helped…
 It’s too bad…
 Whoa! Kidding, kidding, kidding, just kidding!
 Say so sooner if that’s the case.
 Practice for becoming Hokage…
 Yeah-yeah… That has a nice ring to it.
 He fell for it.
 Jeez, he’s naïve…
 Naruto…
 Now then, my adorable team members…are…
 These guys…?
 Oh! Why the heck are you on that side?!
 Man, I don’t want to do such a troublesome mission either.
 Shikamaru will be an assistant to us instructors.
 I will now begin the explanation of the outdoor training
 to be conducted over one night and two days.
 This is the spot you all will be setting out for…
 Great Stone Face of Warudakumi on the summit of Mount Takurami.
 The team leader will not take routes other than the ones indicated on the map…
 in order to ensure the safety of the Academy students.
 Along the way, there will be obstacles such as instructors disguised as enemy Ninja,
 as well as trap and the like.
 But you Academy students should be able to safely evade them
 if you act according to the instructions of your team leaders.
 You’ll see the Stone Face of Warudakumi
 after you cover about eighty kilometers.
 The team that brings the secret document hidden there back to the village…
 will have completed the training upon crossing the finish line.
 There is only one secret document.
 This will be a competition with the other teams.
 All right. We’ll finish first, no matter what!
 You guys ready?!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 An important thing about survival is acquiring food with your own resources…
 This is called Beef Sashimi Grass and it grows in this area…
 You can eat it raw and
 it becomes precious food when the chips are down…
 – Wow! 					– Wow!
 All right! All members acquire food!
 – Yay! 					– Yay!
 This is it!
 Let’s eat…
 That’s a Blowfish Sashimi Grass. lt’s a very similar poisonous grass.
 See? The shape of the leaf is a bit different, right…?
 You two be careful as well, okay?
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Listen up, an important thing in survival is to acquire food by your own resources.
 Something’s not right!
 Disappointing, isn’t it…?
 I’ve got an uneasy feeling…
 Let’s see…
 The geography in this area throws magnets out of kilter…
 When you can’t use a compass…
 Huh?
 You’re wearing a watch, right?
 Oh…yes!
 Look for the bisecting angle,
 which divides the 12:00 direction and the current direction of the hour hand in two…
 And then, when you line up that direction with the sun as of now…
 the approximate 12:00 direction is south.
 Remember that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Let’s…see…
 Huh? This way…?
 Hey, Konohamaru…
 This way?
 No doubt about it…
 He’s totally lost…
 Right, right!
 Yikes…This is bad, believe it.
 A-All right! This way!
 Come with me, believe it!
 Will it be okay?
 That was a more challenging route than I thought, wasn’t it, guys?
 Challenging, my foot! We’re back at where we came from!
 Man, we can’t trust you, Brother Naruto!
 Then why don’t you try?!
 Give me that!
 Oh… It’s this way.
 N-Not bad…
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?!
 What’re you doing, Konohamaru?! Give me that!
 Sorry… Here.
 Let me see…
 Oh, it’s that way!
 What were you guys doing?!
 Hey, we’ve come back again!
 What…? How in the world can we get out of here?!
 All right… I’ll do my best!
 I don’t feel good…
 Hey!
 Good grief…
 Are you guys okay?
 – Yes, Lee Sensei! – Yes, Lee Sensei!
 What did you say…just now?!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei! – Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Lee Sensei…! Ahh, that has such a lovely ring to it.
 This is youth, this is extreme youth!
 Now, run towards that setting sun!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei! – Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Your sweat sparkling in the setting sun is wonderful!
 – Yes, Lee Sensei! – Yes, Lee Sensei!
 Finally made it, huh…?
 Now, I guess I’ll check out Naruto’s team in action.
 Now then… Show me what you’ve learned until now!
 Go!
 All right! Formation One, Konohamaru!
 Sexy Jutsu!
 Adults are a cinch with this Jutsu.
 You idiot!
 You wish, Brother Naruto!
 Times are evolving!
 New formation!
 – Cheesecake Jutsu! – Cheesecake Jutsu!
 Fashion Model!
 Movie Star!
 Tanning Salon Receptionist!
 – We're Cheesecakes! – We're Cheesecakes!
 I’d like to say, just what I’d expect of my best pupils,
 but you still don’t have enough “bust-waist-hip.”
 Jeez…This guy’s such a pain… as always.
 Iruka Sensei!
 What is it?
 A report from the observatory…
 Wow… It’s warm…
 Good thing we listened to you and prepared it ahead of time.
 We would’ve been soaked if
 we were even a little slow putting up the tent!
 Reading ahead is important for a Ninja…
 In particular, if you don’t acutely sense the weatherr,
 it could end up being fatal, so be careful.
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 What’re you doing, Moegi? Pull it properly, believe it!
 I’ve had it! I don’t want to do this!
 Moegi! Stop saying selfish things and hold it!
 But…
 What, really?!
 It seems it’s going to directly hit the Leaf Village before dawn…
 Jeez, why now…?!
 The communication from the observatory
 was probably delayed due to the storm.
 We have no choice, then…
 The training is suspended.
 Convey the order to all the teams immediately!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Why’d you put the tent away?!
 Brother Naruto, what’s the deal?
 This path isn’t on the map.
 We fell behind the others more than I thought.
 We can’t be resting
 Then, this path…
 Yeah… It’s not on the map. lt’s a shortcut route!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Will this be okay?!
 What’re you doing?! We’ll be late if we don’t hurry!
 Don’t talk nonsense!
 We haven’t learned that method of climbing!
 Right! Chakra control comes after we’ve become senior students!
 That makes no difference. You can do anything if you get serious!
 Come on! Let’s go!
 Damn it…!
 Grab on!
 Wh-What’re you doing?!
 Oh! Let go, Konohamaru!
 If I let go, he’ll blow away!
 Let go of the bag, Udon!
 I-I can’t…!
 It can’t be helped…
 No! I can’t hold on any longer!
 That was a close one!
 I issued an evacuation advisory
 to all the teams encamped at the foot of the mountain.
 I see… Now all that’s left is Naruto’s team…
 Iruka Sensei!
 I found this on an unplanned route…
 An unplanned route, you say?!
 What do we do now? We’ve lost our tent and our food…
 There’s no point in saying that!
 What?! It’s because you put your foot on my backpack in the first place…
 What’re you talking about?!
 If my foot hadn’t gotten caught, we would’ve blown away.
 Now, now… Stop fighting, believe it.
 Why didn’t you close the zipper, Udon?!
 Sorry…
 Now, now… Don’t say that, Konohamaru!
 When you get right down to it,
 it’s your fault for entering a strange route, Brother Naruto!
 Right, right!
 What?
 We got behind because
 you got caught in a trap and were lost forever!
 Hey, what did you say?!
 You can’t justify yourself, can you?!
 We could’ve gotten through faster if you guys hadn’t gotten in the way!
 It’s because our leader’s not dependable!
 What?!
 Heh! How silly!
 – What did you say?! – What did you say?!
 What?!
 Ohh… I’m hungry… Temporary ceasefire.
 This is the spot.
 That Naruto…
 After all I told him about following instructions!
 Taking the direction of the wind under consideration,
 they’re above here, I guess…
 Okay, let’s go, Shikamaru.
 Right.
 What’s this?!
 It’s all stuff we need hot water for…
 About the only thing we can eat is the baumkuchen cake…
 I’m hungry…
 You’re asking too much!
 This is survival,
 so it’s common sense to have things ready that can be eaten right away!
 Right, right!
 I won’t share if you’re going to complain!
 I’m taking the big one.
 The biggest one…is mine!
 The big one… The big one…
 Okay, eat up!
 What…? But…
 It’s divided in three?
 You’re not having any here, Brother Naruto?
 Back in the day,
 I also went without food once when I screwed up during training.
 We couldn’t all pull together and Kakashi Sensei got mad at us…
 Cripes! Who cares about three working as one?!
 It's called teamwork.
 I figured it out at that time.
 The important thing for a Ninja isn’t rules or codes,
 but teamwork acting for the sake of comrades…
 Here.
 Sakura…
 Brother Naruto…
 Well as for me, I don’t like sweets, so!
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 You’re one to talk having bought it yourself!
 Your stomach growled.
 You have some too, Brother Naruto!
 It’s pretty slippery. You okay, Shikamaru?
 Yeah…
 Damn it… How could that Naruto take such a dangerous route?!
 Jeez… He’s always causing some kind of trouble.
 What a pain he is…
 It seems they were here until just a little while ago…
 He really does cause…trouble.
 The finish line is right before our eyes!
 That method of climbing isn’t fair, I tell you!
 Right! I knew we shouldn’t have shared the food!
 What is it, Udon?
 What’re you doing? We’ll leave you behind!
 Something’s…coming…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 R-Run while you can!
 G-Got it!
 H-Hurry it up…
 Brother Naruto!
 – Brother Naruto! – Brother Naruto!
 Brother! Brother Naruto! Hang in there!
 What should we do, Konohamaru?!
 We’ll go help him…
 But…it looks like it'll crumble again!
 Brother Naruto! Let’s go, Udon, Moegi!
 Are you awake, Brother Naruto?!
 That was close. So I made it into a space between the rocks, huh…?
 We’re coming to help!
 Idiot! Run, quick!
 Konohamaru…
 We can’t do it… Let’s call for help--
 Brother said it before!
 The important thing for a Ninja is teamwork!
 Konohamaru, you…
 No! If I move even a little, the support rock will give way
 and you guys will end up getting entangled in this!
 Brother Naruto! Have you forgotten what you yourself said?
 You can do anything…
 …if you get serious!
 You guys…
 Konohamaru Gang! Help Brother Naruto!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Be careful!
 Easy does it!
 Yeah.
 But hurry.
 It moved…Time it right and toss it away in one shot.
 Got it!
 One, two…!
 Yes!
 It’s a big success!
 We did it, we did it!
 That was a close one…
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 You guys okay?
 Iruka Sensei! Shikamaru!
 Naruto! Above you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Run towards Shikamaru!
 – Brother Naruto! – Brother Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto…
 Man, making us get all nervous…
 Excellent, Brother Naruto…
 Thank goodness!
 Yeah!
 So, what’s the meaning of this?
 So you see…
 It was all Brother Naruto’s orders!
 We were opposed,
 but he forced us to move ahead saying the only way to finish first
 was to take a dangerous shortcut!
 I said many times we shouldn’t because it’s dangerous!
 But…
 – Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead! – Team leader Naruto forcibly went ahead!
 What…? What?
 It seems that’s about the size of it… You’re prepared, right, Naruto?
 Say…
 Since when did your teamwork get so good?
 Naruto!
 I’ve had it with lectures!
 Hey, wait! Naruto!
 Wait!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 Across the verdant wild came the slender giant!
 Equipped with two wakizashi, a wandering bounty hunter!
 The target is Gosunkugi, the villainous thief!
 A fierce battle of hunt and be hunted! Then comes the voice to halt the action!

 The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu, so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?
 Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?
 Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!
 You keep calling me Pervy Sage.
 So you have no idea that I’m a superb person, huh?
 Huh…? A superb Pervy Sage?
 Nhaagh… Listen carefully!
 Toad Sage is only a disguise!
 As a matter of fact…!
 North and South and East and West!
 I’m the white-maned toad charmer,
 and one of the legendary Sannin whom even celestial beings can’t defeat.
 Such a stud!
 That he strikes fear… in the hearts of people!
 I am no other than “Master Jiraiya”!
 Yes… 					I’m talking about me!

 Atafuku Town? That’s ten kilometers from here!
 It’s “O”tafuku Town!
 Hey…hey… 					Hey, Pervy Sage!
 I’m telling you, it’s Jiraiya. Gimme a break…
 So the fact that such a bigwig Pervy Sage like you
 is taking me along as his travel companion means…
 that I’m potentially a genius?
 Just as I thought!
 Hey! Hey! Hey! Why did you choose me?
 A long time ago, the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
 And you resemble the Fourth Hokage so much, it’s almost funny.
 That’s the only reason…
 I…?
 The Fourth Hokage…?
 Yeah!
 Yeah! Yeah!
 W-What is it?
 Yeah!
 The fact that I resemble the Fourth Hokage means
 that I also possess genius of his level, right?
 I’ll become the Hokage, after all! All right!
 W-Wait…
 I stepped on some dog poop!
 About the only areas you resemble the Fourth Hokage
 are your hair and your stubbornness!
 What was that?! You senile Pervy Sage!
 Not again!
 Sakura? Come here!
 Okay!
 Please take these rice sweets over to Ino’s house.
 Ino’s house?
 These?
 That’s right…
 Don’t bother them by staying too long.
 Because everyone is very busy at this time.
 I know that!
 See you later!
 Oh, yeah…
 I’ll bring some over to Sasuke later on too.
 I wonder if he likes sweets…?
 And to Naruto too…
 Naruto looks like he would eat anything…
 Hey Kakashi Sensei! Teach me Chidori too!
 You may say teach me, but it’s not that easy.
 What the heck’s that?!
 That’s not fair, show me how! Teach it to me.
 Sasuke… Thank you…
 You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?
 No…
 Huh?
 For a start, why don’t you try gathering Chakra in your palms!
 All right!
 The person who rescued you… was Naruto.
 Like this? Like this?
 Oh come on, Sasuke, you’re being overmodest again.
 It’s true that Naruto has gotten stronger, but against that Sand Ninja…
 I’m telling you the truth.
 That kid fought desperately to rescue you.
 He showed a kind of strength that he had never shown before.
 Naruto rescued…me.
 Oh, it’s coming…
 Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
 All right! I’ll bring some to Naruto too!
 I wasn’t… I wasn’t able to do anything…
 I don’t want to watch a precious comrade die right before my eyes ever again…
 No matter what, I will protect you!
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
 Compared to him, I…
 While you may able to manage against him,
 I couldn’t possibly…
 He’s in a completely different level…
 Yeah…
 If we go at each other, we’ll either both be killed or at best,
 kill each other simultaneously.
 Even if we increased the numbers, that wouldn’t change.
 I didn’t expect the kid’s guard would be a legendary Sannin.
 With him as the opponent…
 the names of Leaf Village’s Uchiha Clan
 and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of Mist would be tarnished.
 Yeah. However…
 Any strong one has a weakness…
 Stop! You will get cursed!
 Hey, hey, Pervy Sage…
 Huh?!
 What kind of a student was the Fourth Hokage?
 Well, I guess one could say
 that he developed to that extent because he was my student…
 You’re one lucky guy to be taught by me!
 – Hmmm… 					– Hmmm…
 Are you dubious?
 A good teacher will develop good disciples.
 That goes without saying.
 Then, then, who taught you, Pervy Sage?
 Me?
 I learned from the Third Hokage.
 The Third Hokage?
 That’s right…
 The Third Hokage was still young and lively.
 – The Third Hokage…young and lively? – The Third Hokage…young and lively?
 That’s right! I was young and lively too!
 Young and lively?!
 I…I got tangled up.
 See… You got cursed…
 So you learned from Kakashi.
 Then you experienced the “Bell Training,” right?
 Huh…?
 Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
 Only I was tied to the tree trunk and had one deuce of a time…
 What? You too?
 Huh? What do you mean by “you too”?
 Huh?
 What do you mean by “you too”?
 Why don’t you just hurry, get up and return those things.
 Even if you were to say that… it’s pretty difficult…
 There are two bells.
 The fact that there are only two means…
 That one of us has to go to the tree trunk…
 You’re quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
 All right! I’ll make it!
 Come at me with the intent to kill!
 Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn’t I?
 You got tied to the tree trunk, after all.
 Shut up!
 You flat-chested like a cutting board.
 What did you say?! You nerdy perv!
 Okay, Okay, that’s enough.
 Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
 Okay!
 You are hopeless…
 Ninja shouldn’t be getting caught in obvious traps like that over and over again.
 But…
 Why don’t you learn a little from Orochimaru?!
 Sarutobi Sensei, you’re always saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
 Hm?
 When it comes to snooping, I’m really good at Transparency Jutsu.
 Gimme a break…
 I don’t even wanna know
 what level of Transparency Jutsu you possess…
 I’ve never been caught once! And that’s the truth!
 If you’re that sure of yourself, I’ll go with you next time…
 You’re such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei…
 Huh?! Huh?
 What, what?
 Hey!
 What’s so funny?! Pervy Sage!
 Huh?
 It’s just as I said, a good teacher will develop good disciples.
 Huh…? I don’t understand what you’re saying!
 Come on, let’s go. Did you put it back properly?
 Yeah, I fixed them!
 See!
 It appears that they haven’t found Naruto yet.
 But don’t you think that’s strange?
 Those guys had already infiltrated the village.
 It should be easy to find Naruto in this village.
 Itachi knows Naruto’s face.
 Kakashi…
 Why is Kakashi sleeping?
 Besides, only Jonin are gathering here…
 What are you doing? What in the world happened?!
 Nothing…in particular…
 Is it true that that ltachi has returned?!
 And moreover, that he’s after Naruto…?!
 Oh…
 Idiot…
 Why does this always happen?!
 So that guy returned to this village? And moreover, he’s pursuing Naruto?
 What does all this mean?!
 Sasuke?!
 Where’s Naruto?!
 Huh? I just got here too.
 I wanted to give Naruto…
 Some sweets…?
 If Naruto is caught by that guy, that will spell his end.
 I’m not gonna let him do that!
 Hey old man! Naruto must have come here!
 And do you know where he went after that?
 Oh, Naruto, right…
 If I remember correctly…
 Master Jiraiya came here around noon and…
 They ate ramen together, and he said he was going somewhere…
 Where?!
 Hmm…I think he said to a post station some distance from the village…
 And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya?
 Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.
 Well, in appearance,
 he just looks like a big white-haired old man.
 Big and white-haired…
 H-Hey!
 Geez… If you’re gonna ask somebody a question,
 it’s only polite to stay and have a ramen or something.
 Candies are here.
 This town is pretty weird.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 We’re staying here tonight!
 What?! I can still walk!
 A disciple should obey his master!
 I just want to learn the Jutsu!
 That’s what’s called a disciple!
 Huh?!
 Oh, oh…!
 Naruto!
 Yes?
 Here, this is the key to the room.
 Go to the room ahead of me, practice Chakra,
 train some and go to sleep!
 Got it?!
 What?!
 “The adult world is gonna begin from this point on”…
 Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?! That’s not fair!
 That post town isn’t that far…!
 This! Somehow this always happens when I’m with that Pervy Sage!
 Darn…
 Here…
 Candies are here!
 I’ve got to check door by door!
 Cheers!
 I wonder if he really has any inclination to oversee my training?
 What about that one? Yeah that.
 See! A hundred out of a hundred!
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 This is an inn for women only…
 I’m looking for someone…
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 Today, we only have old people.
 Hmm…this is kind of crisp on the tongue…
 Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
 Do you have a blond kid with a dumb-looking face, about my age
 and a big white-haired old man staying here?
 White-haired…?
 Are they here?!
 Eh…Do I remember seeing some people like that earlier
 when shifts changed…?
 This tastes bitter… are you all right with it? Cheers!
 Oh! A blond kid and a white-haired old man!
 They’re here?! What’s their room number!
 Um…
 Room number one at the end of the hallway
 on the second floor…
 What’s up? Has she already dumped you?
 Okay, Okay!
 Okay, Okay, I’ll open up!
 Naruto!
 It’s not him…
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Darn it! My body is frozen! What is this creepy feeling?
 This guy is absolutely not an ordinary person.
 He’s got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.
 He’s a member of Uchiha clan.
 Is this the guy Sasuke was talking about?

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 The Bewildering Forest
 Hey kids, get out of here if you don’t wanna get hurt.
 Better not think lightly of me!
 I’m not gonna hand this guy over, no matter what!
 Ninja Dropouts…
 It’s not gonna end up with you just getting hurt.
 You’re gonna get killed.
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Blood Rain.
 Todoroki!
 Damn!
 My Jutsu isn’t Ninjutsu.
 It’s Killer Jutsu.
 Sakura!
 Lee, are you all right?
 Yeah, just barely. More importantly, where’s Naruto?
 Is everybody safe?
 Yes. However, Commander Todoroki is nowhere to be seen!
 What was that?!
 Naruto…
 Naruto…
 Die!
 Damn! Let go, you jerk!
 Naruto!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio!
 Akio!
 What a shame…
 You’re not getting back with your comrades.
 Todoroki! Gantetsu!
 Are you all right?!
 Y-Yeah… We’re fine.
 What are we going to do now?
 We’ve gotten separated from Sakura and Bushy Brows…
 There isn’t any question in my mind.
 It’s my mission to deliver this guy to the capital.
 But the ship’s been destroyed, and…
 Those guys are pursuing us!
 What are you doing?!
 If they’re gonna steal this guy away from us anyway,
 it would be better to take care of him right here!
 What do you mean take care of him…?
 Even if we delivered him the capital,
 it’s certain that he’ll be sentenced to death…
 Therefore…
 Rather than having them take him away, it would be better to…!
 It’s not set in stone that they’ll be able to take him away!
 Let’s go!
 Your mission is to guard this guy, right?
 That’s exactly what my mission is too!
 If you so much as try anything, your head’s gonna roll!
 Run!
 We’ll be fine… now that we’ve come this far…
 Looks like we’ve totally lost them.
 We’ve gone pretty deep into the forest, haven’t we?
 I can get our bearings from the position of the moon.
 It’s too dangerous to go back to the river.
 We’ll continue straight through this forest to the capital.
 Because it’s my mission.
 Are you sure it’ll be okay?
 What do you mean?
 You said earlier you were going to finish this guy off, right?
 I was talking about a worst-case scenario.
 Got it… Well then, let’s get moving.
 I wonder if Sakura is all right…
 Naruto…
 It’s Naruto… He’s gonna be just fine.
 Yeah…
 So let’s hurry up and link up with him!
 Lee!
 I detect something strange…
 Where…?
 Up above!
 Lee!
 Let’s follow him! The enemy might have captured Naruto!
 What’s the matter?
 We’re walking in the direction of the moon, right…?
 Then why is the moon following us?
 That’s strange…
 What’s going on…?
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 Once you get lost you can never find you way out again.
 He talked…
 You are in custody. You’re not allowed to talk!
 Wait a second!
 The Forest of Bewilderment…
 You know something about this place?
 What do you know? Tell us!
 The Ninja Dropouts have a hide-out in this forest.
 What was that?!
 So we were escorting you through Ninja Dropout territory…?!
 This forest is perfect for a hide-out.
 The fog, the winds that sweep through the forest,
 the extreme magnetic fields…
 They all make a person lose their sense of direction.
 A person finding himself in this forest for the first time
 will never find his way out.
 I don’t believe that…
 There’s no way we won’t find our way out…?
 You guys won’t.
 Huh?
 But for me, a member of the Ninja Dropouts…
 the outcome will be different.
 I will…
 I will guide you through this forest.
 Yeah, that’s right…
 For you, a Ninja Dropout, this forest is like your backyard, right?
 Okay then, let’s have you guide us!
 Are you some kind of idiot?!
 It’s true…
 The finesse that the Ninja Dropouts showed earlier on
 makes sense if you think that this is their garden…
 And I’ll believe you when you say you have a hide-out here.
 Then even more so…
 Even more so, it's a no!
 Huh…?
 Don’t you get it?
 This guy is gonna pretend to be guiding us out of the forest
 but will actually be taking us to the hide-out.
 Todoroki…
 This is an emergency situation…
 If we don’t kill him, we’ll be killed.
 W-Wait a minute!
 Nobody’s gonna care…if this guy dies!
 Todoroki!
 What’s that…?
 I took all the money the Ninja Dropouts had stolen up to now…
 So I was tortured…
 Those guys don’t want to rescue me…
 They just want to get that money back from me.
 Once they have the money back, those guys will kill me too.
 Do you really think I’ll believe that?
 Wait a second!
 The Ninja Dropouts hide-out is here in this forest, right…?
 Which means it’s like a backyard to them too,
 just like it is for Gantetsu…
 Which means that…
 Which means that what?
 Well, since we've trespassed into their garden
 it’s likely that the Ninja Dropouts will come after us
 whether Gantetsu’s betrayed them or not…
 So I think our only option is to pin our hopes on this guy…
 Am I wrong?
 Hey, are you sure you know what you’re doing?
 Yeah, everything’s fine.
 Those guys won’t figure out this kind of circuitous route.
 Can we really trust this guy…?
 What?!
 I’m used to it’s venom. It’s nothing.
 Are you really gonna be all right?
 Yeah…
 Hey!
 What’s the matter?
 No way!
 You fell for it. You fell for it!
 Here it comes!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud!
 Die!
 You’re the one who fell for it!
 I combined the Shadow Clone Jutsu and the Transformation Jutsu.
 What was that?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now it’s my turn!
 Rasengan!
 I’m gonna strike you down!
 Don’t think it’s gonna be that easy to strike me down!
 Like I'll let you get away!
 Naruto!
 That guy! Trying to get away, huh!
 What are you doing?
 Th-That sound is…
 What?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Thanks to you we made it…Gantetsu.
 What's with you guys?
 They want to fight, it seems.
 I won’t… I won’t be fooled. You…you…
 We’ll be safe if we just follow Gantetsu.
 Todoroki!
 Stop it, Todoroki!
 You said you were going to deliver Gantetsu to the capital, right?
 This guy…
 There’s no way I’ll forgive this guy!
 What are you talking about?!
 This guy…
 This guy killed my family… he killed my little brother!
 Wh-What was that…?
 Gantetsu…
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 It’s true that Gantetsu may be evil,
 but how is taking revenge out on him going to change things?!
 Isn’t our mission to take Gantetsu to the capital?
 And I… I don’t think that he’s an evil person.
 Anyway, you leave me no choice if you won’t listen.
 I’ll stop you with all my strength!

111,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Byakugan!
 Why did you take down Naruto with her?!
 It was an accident…
 Had I not applied the finishing blow to her at the moment,
 we would’ve been in danger instead.
 I know of no instance
 of the Ninja Art: Kujaku being defeated up until now…
 He will be missed.
 Hidden Leaf Shinobi, your mission is over.
 I still haven’t taken back the star.
 We’ll search for it by ourselves. Thank you for your help.
 Hoshikage: The Buried Truth
 Rest easy… I’m not an enemy.
 Come to think of it… What happened after I fell off the cliff?
 Could it be…? Did you save me, lady?
 Yes…
 I see. I don’t really remember, though…
 Well anyway, you saved me! Thanks.
 I’m Naruto, a Ninja from the Village Hidden in the Leaves and…
 Umm, I came to protect the star, but…
 You kind of stole it, lady…
 I’m Natsuhi…
 Natsuhi? What? I’ve heard that name before…
 Oh!
 That red star’s sure pretty.
 Natsuhiboshi… lt watches over me all the time.
 It’s the same name as Natsuhiboshi.
 If I remember right,
 Sumaru said it’s a star that protects him!
 Sumaru said that?
 Yeah! Say, lady… Do you know him?
 Sumaru is my child.
 What?! So, you’re Sumaru’s mom?!
 What?! Sumaru escaped?!
 I am very sorry.
 I was careless thinking the muscle relaxants were still in effect.
 Most likely the guys from the Hidden Leaf
 are the ones who took him away…
 What do we do?
 It’d be bad news if these circumstances were to be known
 by the Leaf, no, by those in our village.
 We’ve got to look high and low for Sumaru right away.
 There’s no need to get rattled…
 We can take care of them at our leisure after we find the star.
 I got it. If we tell the Village Hidden in the Leaves something like
 they died during the mission…
 We could also convince Sumaru.
 I burned Natsuhi’s Chakra into my memory…
 We’ll reach the star
 if we follow the remnants of her Chakra.
 Naruto was…?
 Yeah. Along with the Kunoichi who stole the star.
 But I didn’t see them in the Valley of Death…
 Are you saying they escaped from the valley
 where the poison gas swirls?
 Perhaps.
 If that’s the case,
 they might have crossed the border and escaped safely to the forest…
 Hey, let’s all look for them!
 What’s the deal, guys?!
 Naruto helped all of you, didn’t he?!
 But if we don’t have an order from Lord Akahoshi… Right?
 Yeah…
 We don’t have time to be waiting for an order! I’m going!
 I’m going…
 I’ll go too, if it’s to look for Naruto.
 Mizura, you can’t.
 I want to be useful in some way.
 No… I’ll go.
 Sumaru?!
 You’re okay!
 We safely rescued him from the Hoshikage’s medical room
 where he was being held!
 What? Why was he in Lord Hoshikage’s medical room?
 It wasn’t a Ninja from some other village
 who knocked you all out and took Sumaru away!
 Akahoshi, the leader of your village was the culprit!
 In other words, the Shinobi who made off with the star
 and the Shinobi who attacked all of you were different people.
 That’s what Neji deduced word for word.
 Why would Lord Akahoshi…?
 Why would he do that to us?
 What does this mean, Sumaru?
 I don’t know, either!
 But it seems Lord Akahoshi is hiding something from us…
 Isn’t it about time you guys realized it?
 Akahoshi’s using you as he pleases.
 Mizura is not the exception.
 If you guys continue training this way,
 everyone will collapse and then…
 No way…
 It can’t be. That’s a lie!
 Lord Akahoshi is not that kind of person, ever!
 Perhaps the Shinobi who stole the star will tell the truth.
 Let’s find the Shinobi who disappeared, whatever the cost!
 The forest in the Land of Bears is deep.
 If only outsiders go, they’d just get lost.
 Okay, work with us.
 So leave this to me.
 But…
 You rest now.
 At some point, the time will come when we’ll need your help.
 How about it, Akahoshi…?
 Were you able to get a lead on the remnants of Natsuhi’s Chakra?
 This is good.
 I guess this is what’s called good old home-cooking.
 There’s more.
 One more bowl!
 But why’d you do something like steal the star, Sumaru’s mom?
 This is not the first and only time I took that away.
 Ten years ago as well…
 Huh…?
 Training utilizing that star was painful for many Shinobi at the time
 and even caused many deaths.
 My husband Hotarubi and I who survived the training…
 thought to seal the star to prevent any more victims due to the training.
 A Tracking Unit immediately caught up with us after we had stolen the star.
 Hold it!
 Lord Third Hoshikage…
 Hotarubi…Natsuhi… Your thoughts are reasonable…
 As it happens, I was also wavering.
 But in the position of Hoshikage, it was difficult to make a decision.
 I promise to terminate the star training.
 But the hard-line faction of the Star Village
 might at some point resume the training…
 You two must leave this village!
 I want you to keep an eye on the village from the outside.
 And if it seems that the training will begin once again…
 Please stop it with your power.
 Lord Hoshikage…
 For Sumaru…
 Tell Sumaru that…we died. Please be good to him.
 Yes, I understand.
 Upon allowing us to leave the village,
 the Lord Third Hoshikage completely prohibited the star training.
 Like us, the Third Hoshikage was also distressed
 at the damage from the star training.
 Neji was also talking about that.
 But are the effects from the star that severe?!
 Yes. My husband Hotarubi died due to side effects
 a while after leaving the village…
 I might also die at any time from the effects.
 No way…
 Then let’s go back to the village!
 Tell Akahoshi directly to stop the training!
 Akahoshi is a man who puts the prosperity of the village
 ahead of the lives of the children.
 As proof of that, he has taken Sumaru hostage
 and has demanded that I return the star.
 What?! Then the masked Ninja from that time was…
 Hold it!
 Farewell!
 Wh-What?!
 It was Akahoshi?!
 What is it, Sumaru’s mom?
 They’ve… 					Akahoshi has come.
 Is this the place?
 Where’s the star being hidden?
 Hotarubi… Please protect the star, protect Sumaru…
 The star is under that rock…
 But it seems the entrance is sealed…
 What can we do with a boulder like this…?
 Our only choice is to blow it up little by little with Letter Bombs.
 I won’t let you do that!
 Wha--?!
 Didn’t this brat die in the Valley of Death?
 I won’t be done in just like that, believe it!
 You guys step back.
 Then I just have to do it again.
 Ninja Art: Kujaku Beast!
 Here we go!
 You’re mine!
 I saw that move coming! Become a sacrifice for my beast!
 What?!
 Natsuhi… So you were alive too, after all, huh?
 Akahoshi, reconsider one more time…
 If you stop the star training and release the children,
 I’ll have no more to do with the village…
 I don’t think so!
 The Third Hoshikage was stubborn
 and never wavered in his opposition.
 Opposition to those of us who trained Star Ninja
 and attempted to bring prosperity to the village…
 No! As long as I, the Third Hoshikage, am alive,
 the resumption of that training will never be allowed!
 Return to your posts… That is all.
 Have you lost your mind…
 Akahoshi?
 You’re the one who’s lost his mind!
 Rest easy and go to the other world…
 Our generation will raise this village
 to rival that of the Five Great Hidden Villages…
 Was this…really okay?
 It was necessary for the sake of the village, right?
 Exactly! We can do star training as we please.
 Unforgivable!
 What do you think of all those who are training frantically,
 believing in you guys?!
 One’s even on the verge of dying! Do you understand that?!
 Sacrifice is unavoidable for the sake of village prosperity.
 A Shinobi is merely a tool for that.
 For the sake of village prosperity?
 Knock it off!
 All you’re doing is deceiving the people in the village!
 This is a Star Village issue… I will settle this.
 B-But…!
 Step back!
 Yotaka, Shisou!
 Wha--?! He devoured his comrades’ Chakra!
 My Chakra beast has a full stomach.
 Things won’t go as they did before.
 Talk is cheap!
 Sumaru’s mom…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Neji, how’s Sumaru’s mom doing?
 She’s stable for now,
 but her condition can worsen at any moment.
 What?
 Her Chakra Network that had already been weakened
 due to the side-effects of the star before she received Akahoshi’s attack.
 In other words, her Chakra Network is all beat up?
 Hey, Granny Tsunade could heal her, right?
 I don’t know.
 But either way,
 if she were to use the Ninja Art: Kujaku any further,
 there’s no guarantee she’ll live.

 Shino! 					Let’s rest a little!
 I’m tired from doing nothing but walk since this morning, believe it!
 You’re okay while you can say you are tired.
 It’s because you still have energy left to talk.
 Nothing but quibbling as usual…
 Man, I’m unlucky.
 To be stuck on a mission alone with Shino.
 Hey, old lady.
 Is Motoyoshi Village still far ahead?
 Are you going to Motoyoshi Village?
 Yeah!
 Then you’ll be right there once you cross this path.
 Really? Thank goodness.
 But exercise great caution…
 Huh?
 Dead people also laugh in Motoyoshi Village…
 It will be all over if you’re lured into laughing.
 Naruto.
 It’s Motoyoshi Village.
 We never imagined it at this time…
 To think that in this village…
 an incident too terrifying to even talk about would occur…
 In Mourning
 I’m Futa Kagetsu, the chief mourner.
 I’m Shino Aburame.
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
 Will 		Getting right down to business…
 This is the will of my father, Tobei Kagetsu.
 What’s this?!
 My eldest son, Futa Kagetsu,
 shall inherit the entire Kagetsu family estate…
 HOWEVER…
 A funeral is to be held tomorrow in Motoyoshi Village
 for the head of the Kagetsu family that owns that stretch of mountains.
 I’d like you two to go.
 Funeral security, huh? Naruto can’t do it.
 What do you mean?!
 It’s because you have the most inappropriate face
 in the Leaf Village.
 Say what?!
 I think so as well.
 But there’s nobody else.
 So I reluctantly decided to add Naruto.
 You’ll be the main guy on this mission, Shino.
 You're probably the best suited for this mission.
 Huh?
 As it happens,
 there’s one more important mission in addition to security.
 You’ll understand when you see the will.
 However, in the event that Futa raises his voice in laughter at the funeral,
 he shall lose inheriting rights and upon consultation,
 the estate shall be divided up between the bereaved family members excluding Futa.
 This will doesn’t make any sense at all…
 An abundance of medicinal herbs can be picked in the mountains
 owned by the Kagetsu family.
 I would have no trouble getting by for the rest of my life
 if I were to inherit the estate.
 But all that will all go down the drain just by laughing at the funeral!
 There’s no doubt that the relatives will be in a frenzy
 trying to get me to laugh tomorrow.
 To be honest,
 I don’t have the confidence to withstand it.
 But there is one salvation!
 According to the will,
 it’s acceptable if I, the chief mourner, were to appoint a substitute!
 And so I commissioned the Leaf!
 I asked for someone who absolutely will not laugh!
 This is no doubt the perfect mission for Shino.
 I’ve never seen this guy laugh before.
 Indeed, I leave it to you.
 I understand.
 Big Brother, dinner’s ready.
 This is my little sister Mai, the youngest.
 She lived together with my father in this large home.
 She was also the one at his deathbed during his final moments.
 Mai, this is Shino and Naruto.
 Nice to meet you…
 Let’s eat!
 Wait!
 First, I’ll taste for poison.
 Taste for poison…?!
 I don’t think there would be anyone among the relatives
 who would go that far…
 But you can never be too careful.
 You’ve got a point.
 Will you be all right, Shino?
 No problem. Even if it did contain poison,
 the Parasitic Insects in my body will dissolve it for me.
 Parasitic…lnsects?
 How is it?
 It's all right…
 Shino…laughed?!
 He seems to be in very high spirits. Which means the food is fine…
 Don’t eat!
 Shino laughing like this is definitely strange, believe it!
 There’s a laughing drug in this food!
 Who cooked the food?
 I did.
 But the back door isn’t locked…
 So anyone could get in if they wanted to.
 To think there would be someone in the family
 who would go so far as to poison!
 Oh, no…The drug has gotten to the insects!
 No good… They can’t dissolve the drug.
 Then what will we do about the funeral tomorrow?!
 This is a sight that doesn’t seem of this world, believe it!
 Naruto!
 Even if we were to contact the village now,
 we wouldn’t be in time… for the funeral…
 So Naruto!
 You…
 will have to participate in the funeral as the chief mourner’s substitute!
 No way…
 Naruto.
 I’m very uneasy, but I’ll be counting on you.
 I’m also very uneasy, believe it…
 Will you knock it off?! I can’t sleep!
 You’re early, Tsukiko.
 You’re already here, huh?
 It’s dad’s funeral, after all. I came here in great haste.
 Who’s that kid?
 This is Naruto whom I’ve asked to be my substitute as chief mourner
 since I’m not feeling so well.
 Nice to meet you!
 That’s how it’s going to be, so I will be leaving just with the greetings.
 I see. But it sure is a troublesome will.
 To think you can’t inherit the estate if you laugh at the funeral…
 Be careful.
 She’s my immediate younger sister in question, Tsukiko.
 Five years ago, she married into the next village over…
 But she’s probably the one after this estate the most.
 That kid will be a cinch.
 Each and every one of them… looks greedy…
 What’s that…?
 The monk has arrived.
 Why choose a monk like this, of all people?
 I have no knowledge of this!
 It’s a different person from the monk at the meeting.
 Don’t laugh…
 Don’t laugh…
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 Now then, allow me to begin.
 What was that sound?
 Wasn’t it the wind blowing?
 Naruto, did you not raise your voice and laugh just now?
 No, I didn’t! I didn’t laugh at all, believe it!
 Mai, you heard it, right?
 I don’t know…
 I only heard the sound of barrels falling over.
 Well, fine.
 The funeral has only just begun.
 There are still plenty of chances…
 After all, the opponent is this kid with a stupid look.
 I’m saved…
 Shino, huh? Thanks!
 That was a close shave…
 In order, please.
 Then I’ll go first.
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 No good… He won’t laugh at that...
 I’ll give it one more push.
 Don’t laugh…!
 I must not laugh!
 This kid is nothing.
 I’ll kill him with laughter with that technique of mine…
 This guy also intends on doing something, huh?
 No matter what he does, no way will I laugh!
 Kiyoyasu!
 –Kiyoyasu! 					–Kiyoyasu is…
 Here it comes…
 Whatever he hits me with. I…!
 I must not laugh!
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 A flower came out…
 Don’t laugh…!
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 Don’t laugh, don’t laugh, don’t laugh…
 Laugh… Laugh… Laugh…
 I won’t laugh…no matter what!
 He’s pretty tough…
 But how long can he hold on for?
 We’ll make him laugh by the time the funeral ends without fail!
 That…old woman…
 Dead people also laugh in Motoyoshi Village…
 It will be all over if you’re lured into laughing.
 What’s she doing in a place like this?
 Who’s there?!
 Uh, oh!
 Oh, it’s you Mai…
 With this, it’s over! We’ll put this in everyone’s tea!
 But…
 Everything will go well with this!
 I don’t know about that.
 Who’re you?!
 Shino…
 I heard everything…
 How frustrating…
 If this guy would just laugh, I’d get some of the estate…
 Thank you indeed for today. Allow me to thank you all…
 in place of the chief mourner.
 With this, the mission is complete…
 It looks like it will somehow end all right.
 Once the monk goes home, the funeral will be over.
 Please wait!
 Please let my husband say thank you as well. Okay, dear.
 Hi! Thanks for coming today.
 Huh?
 Huh?
 Wh-What’s he going to do?!
 It was a very nice funeral. I was so moved!
 It’s tear-jerking.
 That Tsukiko… To think she would go this far.
 Naruto, if you can get through this, it will be over.
 Please withstand it…!
 It doesn’t hurt at all!
 I must remember something sad at a time like this!
 Why do I think of the Pervy Sage at a time like this?!
 All right, now is the time to finish him off.
 This is awful! The tears are causing my face to collapse.
 What’re you talking about?
 Your face…is right here!
 N-No!
 Oh, no…
 Yes!
 What?
 D–Dad…
 You’re alive? Dad?!
 Stop it, Big Brother, Big Sister!
 Dad hates fighting!
 I’ve thought up a good joke.
 I’ve thought up a good joke, too.
 Who’re those kids…? Where’d they come from?
 I’d get dad to laugh, first!
 I will be the first! You stay out of it!
 Stop it! Fighting’s wrong!
 It’s as Mai says. Fighting’s wrong! Wrong.
 Futa! Tsukiko!
 –Futa?! 					–Tsukiko?!
 N-Now that you mention it…
 Yeah…They are indeed us from our childhood!
 Oh, fighting’s wrong! A kettle’s a kettle!
 My mom dislikes ponkan mandarins!
 Groping is wrong! Hot sake is where it’s at.
 My wife’s secret stash is kept in a safe.
 Between my legs…
 Ding, dong, ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 Ding-dong.
 –That’s right… –Ding-dong. Ding-dong.
 –When we were kids… –Ding. Yeah, ding-dong-ding.
 –Dad made us laugh a lot –Ding-dong-ding.
 –with his silly jokes… –Ding-dong.
 –lt’s been a long time –Ding. Ding.
 –since I laughed at dad’s jokes… –Dong-dong-dong. Dong
 –Dong-dong –This is it! This is what I wanted to see!
 Dad!
 Then who’s this?
 The laughter stopped.
 Shino!
 I’m sorry, everyone!
 But I didn’t think you’d all come if it weren’t my funeral…
 Mai helped me out a bunch and this was the plan.
 Is that really you, Dad? You’re alive.
 Why’d you do this?!
 In the old days, before we knew that
 the medicinal herbs we could pick in the mountains would be profitable…
 We were poor…
 But we were bursting with laughter.
 However, we got rich from selling the medicinal herbs at a high price.
 And when we’d open our mouths,
 we’d start saying, “Money! Money! Money!”
 And the smiles vanished from everyone’s faces.
 I wanted everyone to remember what’s important.
 I wanted to get back the family’s smiling faces!
 If I wrote that ridiculous will,
 everyone would do stupid things trying to get Futa to laugh.
 And then not only Futa, but everyone would laugh and have fun…
 Happiness isn’t money!
 It’s living while getting along with everyone and laughing!
 I remember…
 Sure enough, laughter is important.
 That’s right…
 To be honest, I’m sick of living at the mercy of money.
 You liar! You’re the one saying money this and money that the most.
 There are different kinds of “money,” and what I was talking about was…
 This bell.
 Could that be…?
 It’s the laughing drug.
 It’s still at experimental stage, though.
 If I made it okay to appoint a substitute chief mourner,
 Futa would summon someone who definitely wouldn’t laugh.
 So I tested it out on that person first.
 I was going to make everyone laugh by putting this in everyone’s tea
 if nobody had laughed by the end of the funeral.
 But…
 There’s no point to laughter using a drug…
 It’s because the people wouldn’t be laughing
 from the bottom of their hearts.
 Instead, they’d be crying in their hearts…
 Like me right now!
 So at the end of the day, what happened with the mission?
 It's probably a success.
 It’s because the Lady Hokage probably knew about the real mission.
 Say-say.
 You transformed into that old man, right?
 Then the “Between my legs, ding-dong-ding” thing was something you…
 Forget about that.
 Absolutely forget about that.
 O-Okay, got it.
 Then, fine.
 Sure enough, I…
 I can’t get used to this guy…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 The mission this time around is a commission from the Land of Greens
 and is protection for some traveling merchants.
 This is just a D-rank mission.
 Don’t complain. The castle lord there is a benefactor of mine.
 Make sure you do nothing wrong.
 I could manage a mission like that asleep, believe it.
 Very well.
 However, I’ve got an important reminder for you.
 Reminder?
 Make sure you don’t forget to take this with you to the site.
 That is all.

113,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 …bring it to an end swiftly!
 I won’t let you do anything.
 First move, a surefire victory!
 Wow! That’s amazing!
 What’s with his body?!
 I dislocate every joint
 and with Chakra, I can control my softened body at will.
 With Chakra…?
 I can also squeeze until your bones break.
 I’ll rapidly tighten as long as you don’t give up.
 I don’t know what kind of ninja tool you’ll use…
 but if I keep doing this to your body, it will make no difference.
 I can break your neck right now.
 So hurry up and give up.
 No.
 Do you want to die?!
 Idiot. You’re the one who’s going to die.
 His neck is broken.
 What?
 How ridiculous…
 Phew…
 Idiot.
 I went a little overboard and ended up killing you.
 W-What?
 Okay, now it’s my turn.
 T-This is a Puppet!
 T-That’s the real body?
 He’s…a Puppet Master…
 He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra from his hand!
 G-Give up…!
 If your bones get crushed, you’ll be able to bend even more, huh?
 For once, I was close to stopping the match in the middle.
 The winner, by an inability to continue the match by the opponent,
 is Kankuro.
 Two against one is hitting below the belt!
 Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!
 It’s not particularly hitting below the belt.
 It’s a puppet, after all.
 That’s the Puppet Master Jutsu.
 He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra.
 It’s the same as using a ninja tool-- like shuriken.
 They’re all great Chakra users…
 I thought I could make it kind of far with Chakra.
 Kunoichi Rumble: The Rivals Get Serious!
 Ino…!
 You’ve got the jitters, don’t you, Sakura?
 Wha…?!
 Even Sasuke collapsed.
 I mean, it felt like it was because it was Sasuke that it ended at that.
 What’ll happen if you take part?
 It might be best if you quit!
 Something like that won’t work on me!
 It’s okay! I can tough it out this time around, too.
 Quit? Who?
 I can hardly wait.
 Cha! Bring it on!
 Now then, to continue, we will begin the fourth battle.
 Man, man, nothing but weirdoes all over the place!
 Don’t you say that!
 You’ve got a point.
 You, too, Sakura?!
 This isn’t the time to be laughing.
 Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
 I never thought… I’d be fighting you, Sakura.
 And what’s more, so soon.
 Ino was a standout among the rookie Kunoichi.
 With Sakura as her opponent,
 will she go…no, can she go with serious intent?
 To think it would be those two of all people.
 Things have gotten gloomy.
 I wonder if Ino’ll be okay.
 That’s for sure.
 What’re you going to do, Ino?
 Sakura! Good luck! Don’t lose!
 Begin!
 Oh, no. I knew it.
 Sakura’s totally blowing Ino away!
 Idiot.
 Say what?!
 If you’re not an idiot, you must be sleeping, aren’t you?
 Who…?!
 Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.
 So this is their level of hand-to-hand combat?
 What?!
 It’s not because they’re Kunoichi.
 Huh?
 It’s just that those two are lukewarm. There’s no man or woman in battle.
 Lukewarm…?
 There!
 Kunoichi must learn not only Ninjutsu…
 but also a wide range of knowledge and refinement as women.
 If you don’t blend into enemy territory and conduct yourselves as a normal woman…
 you’ll have it rough on occasions such as when you work as spies.
 Today’s class is flower arranging.
 Now then, everyone.
 Let’s gather flowers we like.
 Yes, ma’am!
 Ino, wait up!
 You’re such a klutz.
 I’m... not good at stuff like this.
 What about you, Ino?
 That’s no good, considering your name’s Sakura.
 Listen. There are tricks to things like this.
 You know, as for flower arranging,
 after you’ve decided on a main flower, you add other flowers to decorate.
 All flowers can’t be asserting themselves.
 For example…look.
 You can see those cosmos flowers over there, right…?
 For example, if they were the main flowers…
 the thoroughwort flowers you picked are throw-ins!
 As contrasted with spring cherry blossoms,
 cosmos flowers have the name of autumn cherry blossom
 and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.
 Also, they’re flowers with the original meaning of “harmony,”
 so any autumn grass would go perfectly with them.
 So? Do I look as nice as the cosmos flowers?
 Say, say, am I cute?
 Uh…yeah.
 Say. What’s with the pause?
 You look like you’re having so much fun.
 Billboard Brow!
 You’ve recently reached adolescence, haven’t you?
 Don’t get too full of yourself!
 Ami!
 Sorry! You have such a beautiful cylinder-shaped body
 I mistook you for a vase and put flowers in you.
 Ino!
 Shinobi flower aconite.
 It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous, so you’d best spit them out.
 Sensei!
 Only the root is poisonous, though.
 Ino is great.
 She knows everything, is stylish, and is cute.
 Even that shuriken skill.
 Her Ninjutsu is great, too…
 Compared to that, I…
 Sakura?
 If you’re a cosmos flower…
 then am I a thoroughwort?
 What’re you saying?!
 What?
 Let me see…
 In a manner of speaking, you are not a flower, but still a bud!
 You’re right.
 At this point in time…
 I don’t even plan to fight over Sasuke with you.
 What did you say?
 You and Sasuke don’t go together, and I’m totally stronger than you!
 You are beneath my notice!
 Sakura! Do you know who you’re lipping off to?!
 Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura! 169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like...
 I feel like Sakura was out of line!
 Ino’s eyes show incredible anger. She’s scary.
 Hmm. That's not it...
 Huh?
 Sakura’s not the kind of kid to do things
 like needlessly flaunt her own power and hurt people.
 She doesn’t like having Ino taking pity on her and pulling punches.
 I’m a bud, huh…?
 Say, Ino…
 What?
 Why…did you give this ribbon to me?
 Actually…
 I thought it’d be a waste for you to wilt away as a bud.
 There’s no point if flowers don’t bloom.
 For all we know…
 it just might...
 become a flower more beautiful than a cosmos.
 Thank you...
 Ino!
 Okay Sakura. Let’s hurry and go pick flowers.
 O-Okay.
 What’s wrong, Sakura?
 I got some dirt in my eye when I fell…
 You’re so clumsy.
 Ino…
 All along, I believed in the words you gave me then.
 I really thought that it would be nice if it were so.
 It would be nice if I could get a beautiful flower to bloom…
 I set my sights on you because I wanted to be like you all along.
 Thanks to that, I’m here now.
 So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.
 If I can’t surpass you at your most serious, there’s no point.
 W-What’s with Sakura?
 Hmm.
 Why are those two getting that heated?!
 Alas, he doesn’t even understand the reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.
 Well, a rival is a mysterious thing, is the point.
 Huh?
 Oh, hi…
 My rival from youth, Kakashi…
 Oh, how hip and galling that nonsensical reaction is.
 I…
 got on the same team as Sasuke.
 Why are you telling me now…?
 I won’t lose to you anymore, Ino.
 No matter what happens, I won’t lose to you either, Sakura!
 The ribbon…
 I’m giving back the ribbon.
 I gave you that ribbon.
 Besides, a headband is something you put on your head, right?
 From here on, I’m no longer a girl who will run after you, Ino.
 When I put this on my head,
 it will be as a female Shinobi who can’t lose to you.
 That’s a good idea…
 Me, too…
 until that time.
 I understand…Sakura.
 – This time for sure... – This time for sure...
 – with full strength… – with full strength…
 – a fair…fight! – a fair…fight!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Since when did she get this strong?!
 Sure enough, Ino’s great.
 But I won’t lose. I absolutely will not lose.
 It can’t be. She’s evenly matched with me now?!
 I’m not who I used to be.
 – The next hit is the decisive blow! – The next hit is the decisive blow!

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.

 Because I had a sad dream last night.
 My eyes are red, from the tears I shed ♪
 Swollen as I cried…
 Hey!
 Neji! Naruto!
 What happened to those guys?
 It seems they were attacked by the Shinobi in question…
 So he appeared again?
 He took…he took Sumaru away.
 What? He took Sumaru?!
 Yeah!
 Anyway, helping the guys who are down comes first!
 We’ll split up and carry them!
 Got it…
 Roger!
 Mizura…
 Naruto!
 They were attacked by the Shinobi in the mask!
 There are no external injuries… They’re just unconscious.
 Umm… What about the others?
 Lee and Tenten are carrying them here now.
 I see…
 Then Sumaru as well…?
 Oh… Uh…
 He was taken away by the masked Shinobi.
 I’m sorry…
 He escaped into the Valley of Death…
 We couldn’t go after him.
 The Valley of Death?!
 Did he inhale the gas from the Valley of Death?
 No… I put him into a state of suspended animation beforehand,
 so there was no effect on his body.
 I understand using Sumaru to lure that person…
 But to use a child from our same village…
 Is it enough to make you feel ill at ease?
 We’re comrades who have already dirtied our hands…
 What’re you doing talking nice now?!
 We’ll make those Hidden Leaf kids believe that
 Sumaru’s kidnapping was the work of that person…
 After we’ve taken back the star, we can leave the clean-up to them…
 Hidden Jutsu: The Price of the Ninja Art: Kujaku
 Mizura isn’t feeling well and is taking a break from his training…
 Byakugan!
 What’s this…?!
 Mizura!
 You okay?
 You still need to rest…
 I must not rest at a time like this…
 I understand how you feel…
 But you shouldn’t push yourself too hard!
 I’m fine… I can walk by myself…
 Mizura! See, didn’t I tell you?!
 I’m okay by myself!
 Mother… Father!
 Mother! Father!
 Do not cry… Sumaru…
 Your parents protected the star and protected the village admirably.
 Sumaru… Look up at the sky and watch.
 There is a treasure you can see only in the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 If you were born as a Shinobi,
 for the sake of protecting this village, for the sake of protecting the star,
 become strong!
 Like your father and your mother… Okay?
 Lord…Hoshikage…
 Yeah, this looks good!
 Naruto…
 Huh?
 At this rate, Mizura will die!
 I felt a Chakra disturbance and looked into it.
 Despite him lying quietly,
 his Chakra was being activated to the utmost limit.
 If that keeps up, he’ll be killed by his own Chakra.
 That could never be…!
 There’s no mistake…
 But…!
 It’s because of the star training.
 The star has the power to activate Chakra.
 However, many Shinobi are unable to control the amplification,
 their bodies break down and it leads to death.
 In the middle of this training, Mizura also…
 The Third Hoshikage terminated training utilizing the star
 due to the large amount of casualties.
 Then why again?
 Lord Akahoshi, the current leader of the village,
 decided to resume the training half a year ago.
 Something so dangerous!
 We’ll make him stop right now!
 Those born and raised in this village do not fear the star training!
 Why would you…?
 If they can complete the training by themselves
 and make every effort possible for the village as a Hidden Star Shinobi…
 Even if the body were to be destroyed, they would be satisfied.
 That’s just…
 Go!
 Notice my Chakra… Natsuhi!
 Hotarubi… Please protect the star, protect Sumaru…
 Akahoshi’s Chakra…
 Please use this until you get better… I’m sure you will!
 Thanks, Naruto…
 But I won’t…
 It seems his condition has stabilized…
 Everyone seems okay for the time being.
 It still doesn’t sit right with me…
 Mizura and Hokuto, they’re all thinking earnestly of the village.
 Especially that Sumaru guy.
 He thinks of the village more than anyone.
 What do you mean…?
 If it were for the sake of protecting the village
 and the special comrades around me…
 I would’ve gotten impatient, wanting to get strong quickly as well.
 Yeah… That’s right…
 Yes…
 Well, this isn’t the time to be saying stuff like that.
 The unforgivable one is that star thief!
 But, there wouldn’t be any suffering from training if they didn’t use the star.
 I think so, too.
 If they have the star, everyone would train for the sake of the village.
 But if they do train, then their bodies get…
 Geez, I don’t know what to do!
 Our mission is to protect the star. Our first priority is to get back the star.
 We shouldn’t be meddling in the matters that follow!
 That’s right…
 Okay.
 Got it!
 Lee and Tenten, you guys search around the village chief once more!
 What? Again?
 Why did the flying Shinobi escape to the dangerous Valley of Death?
 Even though he got the star,
 why did he go so far as to take Sumaru away?
 Come to think of it… Why is that?
 The quality of Chakra of the one who took the star
 and the one who took Sumaru away were completely different.
 – Huh?! 					– What?!
 Say what?!
 That’s right… There are two masked Shinobi!
 What does that mean?
 In my opinion, there’s more to this mission than meets the eye.
 As usual, impressive Ninja Art: Kujaku, Lady Natsuhi.
 Where is he…? Where’s Sumaru?!
 Before that, I’ll have you return the star to me…
 I’ll trade it for Sumaru!
 The star first!
 I refuse!
 Then I’ll take it back by force if I have to!
 What’s so funny?!
 Akahoshi… You’re no competition to me.
 Even after you left the village,
 a few of us who were interested continued training in secret!
 You think you have completed the star training
 by training on your own?
 Verify with your own eyes whether or not I’m no competition!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Such a folly… I have no choice.
 Ninja Art: Kujaku… Beast!
 Wha--?!
 To think she’d be this tough…
 Yotaka! Shisou!
 Go!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 What’re you thinking, Akahoshi?!
 I’ll have you play along with me a little while longer…Lady Natsuhi.
 Huh? What is it?
 A flow of massive Chakra…
 Is it him?!
 No mistake!
 Oh?! Who is it?!
 Our helper from the Leaf…
 The Shinobi who seized the star has appeared!
 Lord Akahoshi is now delaying that person…
 Please fight with us!
 All right! Let’s hurry!
 The enemy’s power is mighty and Lord Akahoshi alone cannot…
 It’s all he can do to delay the enemy.
 Right. Leave it to us!
 It seems nobody’s here.
 It seems they’ve gone out…
 There’s a faint presence inside the residence.
 Now’s our chance. Let’s infiltrate!
 Right!
 Ninja Art: Phantom Jutsu!
 What?! Lee?
 Since when could you use Ninjutsu…?
 Tenten! It’s okay. There’s nobody in here!
 Hey, that’s not Ninjutsu!
 Kind of…
 Suspicious, eh?
 Yikes!
 Uh…uh, oh…
 Well… I guess I can do it later.
 It seems to be a medical room…
 Somebody’s being laid down in a bed.
 I wonder who it is?
 That’s…!
 Sumaru!
 Why did you make Sumaru and the others do that star training?
 You should’ve been told by the Third Hoshikage
 about how dangerous that training is!
 You yourself…are the answer to that!
 What?!
 That Chakra is wonderful!
 It would make for great fighting strength
 if we had one hundred, no, even ten Shinobi like you!
 The likes of the Five Great Hidden Villages would be no match for us
 even if they all ganged up on us!
 It’s still not too late.
 Let’s make this village into an invincible Hidden Star Village!
 It hurts… It hurts…
 My body feels like it is on fire!
 Help me…
 I must train… Star training…
 – That’s enough… That’s enough. – For the sake of Hidden Star Village…
 There’s no need to do such painful training!
 That sorrow must not be repeated…
 If you’re saying you’re going to continue this any further…!
 W-Wait! If I die, Sumaru will also die!
 You can’t do it! Natsuhi!
 Sumaru, who is more important than your life, is in my hands!
 There he is! He’s moving in on Akahoshi!
 All right! I won’t let him get away this time.
 Wait! He’s not an opponent you can take on from the front.
 I’ve got a plan.
 A plan…?
 I’ll stop his Chakra, so I leave the rest to you!
 Indeed, the situation will get worse if we’re too slow.
 Got it! Be careful, Naruto!
 All right! Let’s go!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Let’s go! 					– Let’s go!
 You again?!
 It’s more than I imagined.
 It’s impossible from the front, after all.
 What?!
 Where’s the real body?!
 Oh, no!
 I get it.
 When controlling massive Chakra,
 less attention is paid to the area around the main body in spite of everything…
 Good thinking, Naruto!
 He… He did it…
 A woman…?!
 The Hidden Leaf Kid has done it…
 I can find the star if I take the time…
 But now’s my only chance to defeat Natsuhi!
 As long as she interferes, I won’t be able to carry out my ambitions!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku!
 Beast!
 Naruto! Look out!
 Shoot!
 Naruto!
 Something the matter, Mizura…?
 No… It’s nothing…
 Naruto…
 Mother…
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Oh! Everybody, I just realized something important!
 What is it all of the sudden?
 Sumaru was being captured by Akahoshi!
 Which means that the culprit who attacked everyone was Akahoshi!
 And?
 Believe it or not! One of the masked Shinobi is Akahoshi.
 Neji said that long time ago, remember?
 Excellent, Neji. You are a sharp one!
 Can we move on?

115,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Byakugan!
 Caught ’em!
 All right! All right! I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!
 Naruto! Hate to tell you this,
 but I’m gonna demonstrate my new Jutsu right here!
 Me, too!
 Don’t be so hasty.
 As soon as preparations have been made to implement my strategy…
 we’ll make direct contact with the target!
 It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet.
 Huh? Sasuke isn’t there.
 It appears that…
 he’s inside that “coffin.”
 What’s this?
 I poked the bush for kicks
 and out comes not even a snake, but just two bugs.
 Hey, wait a minute! Wait!
 We didn’t come here to fight.
 We just came here to negotiate!
 Huh, then…
 What are they?!
 There’s no point to that Smoke Bomb.
 You can’t run away from me.
 It’s string that's thinner and stronger than wire that you can hardly see.
 My string is placed all over this place.
 Darn.
 Those two types of wires on the trap were on purpose…
 It was actually a triple trap.
 Darn.
 Didn’t think they had one with such ability in the group…
 You will be…!
 What’s going on...? My body…
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
 But… There is one with ability like this, too.
 Thanks for getting caught so nicely in my strategy.
 Darn… But...
 I have this kind of ability, too.
 Where did it come from?
 Earth Style Barrier!
 Earth Dome Prison!
 Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!
 Darn!
 Where is this?
 Inside of that big guy’s barrier.
 Darn!
 These guys are mine. I want to recover as much as possible.
 Once you’re done eating, catch up with us,
 we’re going ahead.
 Come quickly.
 Let us out! You!
 Be quiet, Naruto!
 From the looks of it, it just looks like a dirt wall…
 It’s their Jutsu, there must be some kind of trap.
 I don’t know what it’s made of,
 but we’re just going to have to tear this wall down!
 Even though it’s dangerous to be careless,
 actually it’s more dangerous to remain silent here.
 Tunneling Fang!
 The wall is restoring itself…
 Hey…
 I saw that.
 Let us out!
 It’s not just a dirt wall, after all.
 Byakugan!
 Th-This is…
 What is it ? What’s happening?
 This is bad. Chakra’s getting sucked up…
 Darn… I didn’t expect that they would just keep us in the barrier,
 but I didn’t predict that they would suck our Chakra either.
 Man. How dare they! Let us out of here already!
 I’ve had a good amount of Chakra. Thank you for the meal.
 I feel like my body energy is being sucked out.
 It won’t be good if we stay like this here, Shikamaru.
 It was careless to get caught
 before we even figured out our enemy’s powers.
 On top of all that…inside here.
 Darn! I’m going to make an air hole before all my Chakra is gone!
 Akamaru!
 The Food Pills!
 Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!
 And for me, Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!
 Fang Over Fang!
 All right! Good going, Kiba.
 It’s useless…
 Darn! It starts to restore the moment it’s hit.
 Same with the ground.
 At this rate, we won’t be able to keep up for another ten minutes.
 We’ll lose all our Chakra and be totally annihilated…
 I can’t use the Rasengan that requires extremely difficult Chakra control
 especially in a place like this that sucks the Chakra out of us.
 Darn!
 Hey, I want you to listen to me! I want to talk to your leader.
 We won’t go after Sasuke anymore, so let us out of here!
 Hey…
 Shikamaru, what are you saying?
 Pleading for your life, how interesting…
 But you guys are my prey, I can’t let you out.
 Then…just let me out on my own.
 This battle…
 is such a pain.
 You! Do you know what you’re saying?
 Shut up, Kiba, be quiet…
 What?!
 A split in the group, huh?
 Seems like you’re the leader, but…
 I didn’t think you would be the only one begging for your life!
 You really see a human’s true nature when one is pushed to the edge of death.
 You’re such a low-life creature,
 you’re not qualified to be responsible for the lives of your platoon members.
 I’ve saved the most important thing for last…
 To abandon Sasuke and to even sell out on your own platoon…
 Is that what it means to be a Chunin of the Leaf?
 Sasuke is a Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my life on the line to help him!
 That's the way of the Leaf Village.
 Someone like you deserves to die… I won’t let you out.
 Shikamaru! I believed in you, but now I’ve lost confidence in you!
 Let’s take this outside!
 Hey, we can’t get out! You fool!
 That’s why we’re in this situation!
 What do you mean by ""fool""?
 I’m just speaking the truth, fool!
 Oh! You said ""fool"" again!
 Everybody, be quiet for a second!
 Choji?
 Now he’s squatting down. What is he thinking?
 Hey! Why are you eating snacks all of a sudden?!
 Choji binge eats when he gets upset…
 Geez, another useless guy.
 It can’t be helped! ln this case, Shadow Clone…!
 Stop it.
 The enemy’s Chakra is placed all over that wall.
 Even if you are able to scratch it, the wall will restore itself right away.
 In other words, it’s useless unless we can attack it
 with a Taijutsu that has enough power to destroy this wall with one blow.
 Somebody that has a Taijutsu with greater destructive power than mine
 would be Choji, but…
 At this rate…
 Darn, what do we do!
 Neji… I’m sorry, but can you use the rest of the Chakra you have
 to observe the wall behind you and the wall behind Choji?
 I got it.
 Shikamaru! You be quiet!
 Naruto!
 You still don’t understand?!
 Remember what Shikamaru said when he gathered everyone!
 Even I can't just sit back and be a sluggard.
 Because I'm responsible for your lives.
 Choji, don’t raise your voice too much from here.
 Kiba, dent that wall behind Neji and Choji again!
 Y-Yeah…
 Huh! I don’t fully understand what’s going on,
 but I’ll go wild one more time!
 Tunneling Fang!
 Huh! No matter how hard you try, it’s useless!
 Huh, I see…
 It’s over there.
 Neji!
 Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.
 Choji, are you ready?!
 Okay! Any time!
 All right, let’s do this.
 What’s happening?!
 Like I said earlier, the wall’s surface is planted with Chakra.
 But even this tough wall could have an area that have a thin layer of Chakra.
 That is what Shikamaru speculated.
 How…How did you get all of that?
 Think about what happened earlier.
 Because he noticed that there were areas that restored quickly
 and others that didn’t so quickly
 when Kiba and Akamaru attacked the wall surface.
 In other words, he guessed that those areas that didn’t restore quickly
 probably has a thin layer of Chakra.
 On top of all that, by cleverly talking to the enemy,
 he figured out the position of the enemy outside of the wall.
 He guessed that the wall furthest from the enemy
 probably had the thinnest point of Chakra,
 so that’s what he wanted to confirm.
 That’s what it is, correct?
 I see, in order to trick the enemy, you must trick your friends first.
 I didn’t see that there was such a plan behind that conversation.
 Then, Choji realized the plan
 and the reason why he was eating was to replenish his Chakra.
 These two…
 They haven’t been working together as a team all these years for nothing.
 I’m depending on you, Choji.
 Yeah!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 All right, let’s go!
 Human Boulder!
 What?!
 Choji… You are awesome, after all!

 Huh? What are you saying all of a sudden, Choji!
 There’s no way that’s possible!
 But, Choji is right.
 If we keep lagging, we won’t be able to catch up with Sasuke.
 But still…
 Don’t worry. I have an idea.
 Choji, are you possibly thinking…
 Do you have a plan or something?
 Yeah.
 Hey! Choji!
 That’s right! I have that secret weapon of mine!
 Next time: “Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!”
 I’m the one who will defeat that guy!

 But thank goodness your injury wasn’t serious.
 Naruto was relieved, too…
 The rumors were true…
 That the survivor of the Village’s honorable Uchiha Clan
 was the most good-for-nothing kid…
 Sasuke, you must be hungry. ls there something you want to eat?
 I’ll go buy something for you.
 The Battle Begins: Naruto vs. Sasuke
 To be honest, I really don’t understand.
 It seems there were opinions that,
 with the final exam being suspended,
 no one should pass this time around.
 But I hear the late Third Hokage highly praised your match.
 It seems he intended to recommend you for Chunin.
 The lords of other lands who observed the fight
 and the proctors were of the same opinion as well…
 In that case, it’s not in my place to say this or that about it.
 From now on,
 strive to perform in a manner that is worthy of that headband…
 Congratulations! As of today, you’re a Chunin!
 – Wow… 					– Wow!
 Even you who’s never motivated look respectable.
 It doesn’t suit you.
 Don’t laugh, I say…
 For the time being,
 let’s have a toast to celebrate Shikamaru’s promotion to Chunin!
 Let’s eat!
 Oh! Choji!
 Don’t eat the meat before the toast!
 But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so…
 There’s a lot of meat. Eat up!
 All right!
 Right now, I have no interest in you…
 Your target is Naruto, after all.
 You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji.
 Don’t you know how to savor the taste?
 Never mind!
 Even if I eat a lot, I know how to savor properly.
 Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meat that I’ve been grilling!
 The last bite!
 This is the conclusion and
 will become the meat with the greatest value that should be savored!
 I won’t hand over this last bite to anyone!
 What’re you acting cool for, you idiot?!
 Everyone makes fun of you because you’re like this!
 – You’re just a fa-- – Ino!
 That’s a taboo word!
 But really, Choji…
 A meal isn’t a battle.
 Relax at a time like this at least. What a pain.
 Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed… Too lazy…
 I wonder if these guys will be okay from here.
 In particular…
 Choji. With you it’s nothing but food.
 Do a little training sometime!
 Choji…
 You’re lucky that your mind doesn’t restrict what you eat…
 I’ve got it rough with a diet.
 Why do you have to diet, Ino?
 Girls want to be seen as cute as possible by the one they like!
 But that person might not always like a thin person.
 In the first place, most boys don’t like fa--
 Not that… They like thin girls.
 And, vice-versa.
 You should be a little more conscious of your body, Choji.
 You won’t be popular.
 Heh… She doesn’t get it.
 Men don’t like thin women as much as women think.
 More likely men who like chubby women are the most common.
 And, vice-versa…I’d say.
 I bet she’d be twice as popular
 if she were to gain a little more weight instead of dieting.
 You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.
 And you’re smart, too.
 Hmm?
 I know it in my heart…
 You’re much more awesome than the likes of Sasuke or Neji.
 Well, I’ve never even thought about that. I’m me, so…
 But you’re the only one who became a Chunin
 in the Chunin Exam this time…
 But you might be better at fighting, right?
 I might’ve given up if I’d gotten into one with you.
 But earlier, Sensei told me that all I do is eat
 and that I’m not progressing…
 I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you.
 It’s stupid talking about how which is.
 Well, don’t worry too much about what Asuma says…
 You should live naturally and take things easy.
 See you later! I’m going home.
 My dad’s starting to say some troublesome thing
 like he’s going to teach me a new Jutsu or something.
 Shikamaru.
 Hmm?
 What?
 Good luck with your training.
 Yeah.
 You’re a good guy…Choji.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto!
 The time is right…
 Head for the Leaf Village, now!
 I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh?
 Yes!
 I’m carrying out fitness training to get ready for the surgery.
 I want to return as soon as I can after the surgery, so…
 Oww!
 Ow-ow…
 Lee…
 Yes?! What is it?
 You won’t die if you give up being a Shinobi.
 Why are you so fixated on being a Shinobi?
 My everything is proving that even I can become a fine Ninja…
 You might die. Even if you succeed…
 Even so…
 I promise you!
 That’s my dream, so…
 Why…do you snap this much at the mention of Hokage’s name?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the name of Hokage, no matter what!
 Because, Hokage is my dream!
 In this village, promising children are being brought up.
 Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough, you were a wonderful Hokage.
 The surgery is in the afternoon. Get ready!
 Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?!
 Yes!
 I got some apples… You like them, right?
 Here, doesn’t it look good?
 Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife…
 It’s right in front of you, believe it.
 It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrained just because you’re in front of Sasuke.
 I’d rather hear lame from anyone but you…
 Naruto…
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto 2K Barrage!
 Knock it off already!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I will…protect Sakura!
 I-I give up, believe it…
 Sasuke… Thank you.
 You rescued me from the Sand Ninja, right?
 No...
 The person who rescued you… was Naruto.
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak…?
 It’s because you don’t have enough…
 ...hate.
 Good. I peeled it nicely.
 I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and…
 Here, Sasuke.
 Ow! What happened?
 S-Sasuke?
 Huh? What’s going on?
 Wh-What?
 Y-You don’t have to glare at me like that.
 Hey, Naruto…
 Wh-What is it?
 Fight me… Right now!
 What?! Here you are, just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.
 What’re you saying?
 Just fight!
 Sasuke…
 You think you saved me?
 I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokage or whatever, but…
 she should’ve just minded her own business!
 What?!
 You said you wanted to fight me, right?
 I’m saying let’s do it now!
 Or have you chickened out?
 S-Sasuke. Hey… What’s going on?!
 Naruto, you say something too!
 What’s this all of a sudden?
 This is perfect, believe it!
 I was just thinking I wanted to fight you!
 S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay?
 Come with me!
 What’s…this feeling? My lower belly feels tight…
 I want to fight you, too.
 And… I feel a thrill.
 What’s so funny?
 Nothing’s funny, believe it! I’m happy!
 When I think I can finally beat you here!
 Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priority of our organization, Akatsuki.
 What did you say? Don’t talk foolish, you failure!
 I’m not going to be a failure forever!
 Right now, I have no interest in you…
 You… A loser like you better not act all high and mighty!
 Hah! It’s unlike you to lose your cool and raise a fuss.
 So uncharacteristic.
 It couldn’t be that you picked a fight and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that! I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just do it!
 You wouldn’t even be able… to put one knick on my forehead!
 You’re wrong!
 I’m saying this is a testament to fighting on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
 And I’m saying stuff like that is acting high and mighty!
 Do you think that we’re equal?!
 Yeah, I do! I’ve never once thought that I’m inferior to you!
 You’re an eyesore!
 That’s because you remain weak! Little Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t be getting carried away!

 we carried out our missions together.

 and only I've been left behind.

 No matter what, I can't see you, Sasuke.

 They say it does a world of good for fatigue and beauty.
 Aren’t we going straight home? Everyone’s waiting!
 Naruto’s right.
 Our hometown is in a state of emergency,
 there’s no time to procrastinate.
 It won't make much difference if we’re one or two days late…
 It’s really popular with girls, and it’s mixed bathing…
 Hey?! Pervy Sage?

 Yes…nicknamed “the Legendary Sitting Duck.”

 Wha--?! There are so many zeros!
 I’m Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.
 The boss ordered us to collect on the debt three years ago…
 We set out on a journey from Akagi Mountain
 prepared not to return until we get the money back.
 We’ve heard rumors about the lady here and there…
 But, she sure was something.
 She was elusive and quite hard to find.
 Then recently, we caught some information that she’d appeared.
 We were waiting on the side of the road…
 That’s when we came along with Old Lady Tsunade.
 But why did you raid the room so stealthily?
 Rumor has it that
 that ordinary means don't work against the “Legendary Sitting Duck.”
 We didn’t think that if we tried to collect amicably,
 she would pay us.
 She’s certainly stingy…
 We heard that she cherished the necklace next to her life,
 so we thought she’d pay in exchange for it.
 No way. After all, you raided my room.
 We never even dreamed that the owner of the necklace would have changed…
 Err… Can’t you ask the lady to pay?
 Uh, even you say so...
 Please! If we don’t get the money back, we can’t go home!
 Our wives and kids are waiting for us to come home!
 – Please…I’m begging you! – Please…I’m begging you!
 It’s all gone…
 Bad luck… Darn it. I’m stone broke.
 Well, let’s call it quits with pachinko.
 It’s about time for a bath…
 – Shizune… 					– Yes?
 My bag is at the front desk of the inn.
 What?! Y-You can’t mean to bring it here?!
 Everything to your name is in it…
 I’ve just lost! I can’t repress this feeling!
 Just bring it without complaint.
 Yes, ma'am!
 Huh? Could you be…
 Y-You are…!
 There are women, all right…
 But…
 I was hoping for younger, more titillating women…
 This one, right?
 Thank you…
 Are you with Ms. Tsunade?
 Yes.
 This came for her not long ago…
 To Tsunade 		A letter? I wonder who could’ve…?
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Huh? Lady Tsunade!
 She’s not here…
 Okay, Tonton…
 You know to search for Lady Tsunade, right!
 What, impossible? Why?
 I see! The smell of the sulfur from the hot spring interferes…
 Well then, the only way to search for her is on foot!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
 Where are you!
 We have a problem!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, what in the world should I do?
 We have Naruto Uzumaki.
 If you want him returned unharmed, please return all of the money you owe!
 We'll wait by the three cedars on the mountain behind. The Akagi Family
 What should I do? I have to help Naruto.
 On top of that, if it’s discovered that Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,
 talk of her installment as the Fifth Hokage will probably end.
 That’s right, we have to handle this by ourselves.
 Right, Tonton?
 Do you think it’s going to work out well?
 No problem.
 Here she comes.
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 Stop!
 You know who we are, right?
 You’re the henchmen of the Akagi.
 Then I'll make it brief.
 Pay back your debt in one lump sum.
 Or else…
 his life is over!
 Help me!
 Whatever. His life doesn’t matter much to me.
 – Huh! – What did you just say?!
 Well then, the money…
 Why did it come to this?
 This isn’t titillating, this is just tight!
 Drats! Let me have patience!
 Didn’t you hear me?
 It doesn’t matter to me what happens with his life.
 You… darn old hag!
 Was what I would have said, until just a little bit ago, I think.
 Once I become the Hokage, he’d be a precious subordinate.
 I can’t leave him in the mess.
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Right now, this is all I’ve got. Take it.
 Let me make sure of this.
 I don’t mean it’s paid off in full, but that’ll do it for the interest, right?
 Fake!
 You’re not going to pay the money back?
 It's none of your business.
 These guys can’t go home! Don’t you feel sorry for them!
 You couldn’t possibly?
 In that case, I’ll have to use force to get it back!
 Naruto’s Shadow Clones?!
 I see, Naruto has joined hands with the Akagi Family…
 So, where did Naruto and company go?
 As expected…
 I didn’t think she’d hand the money over meekly.
 But to be that much of a coward…
 What should we do?
 Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.
 No doubt there’s money in it.
 We have to do something to get our hands on that suitcase.
 Shoot!
 I'm supposed to be kidnapped, and she’s casually drinking sake.
 It’s that suitcase.
 How do we get it out?
 Leave it to me.
 Lady Tsunade, you’ve returned.
 Ah, here’s the suitcase.
 It’s dangerous, so let’s leave it at the front desk.
 Well then…
 Look, I went and got it!
 – You did it! 					– You did it!
 Old Lady Tsunade!
 Shoot… If you’re the Hokage…
 If you’re the Hokage,
 then pay your debt back like a Hokage would!
 A Hokage is meant to protect everyone!
 These guys can’t return their home, they are desperate!
 Why don’t you do something?!
 Naruto…
 Or do people from other countries not matter to you?
 That kind of Hokage… I cannot accept!
 Now!
 Here!
 Hurry up and run away!
 – Right! 					– Okay!
 Oh, she’s already catching up!
 It’s all or nothing!
 Huh?
 – You did it! 					– You did it!
 Tonton?!
 Naruto!
 Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!
 F-Fork over the suitcase!
 If we take a direct hit from Old Lady Tsunade’s attack,
 then it’s over!
 Out of the way, out of the way!
 Purse snatchers?
 Excuse us!
 Hey what’s going on?!
 Hey! Don’t cause trouble for the general public!
 It’s because you’re following us!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What’s going on…?
 Naruto, we leave it up to you.
 This is no good.
 If the contents of that suitcase become known,
 it will be a disaster…
 That’s right, that happened too.
 And I was young then too.
 Gulp it down.
 Excuse me, Boss.
 What is it? You’re in front of a guest.
 W-Well…
 A clone!
 That’s a clone too?
 Wrong again.
 Sheesh, which is the real one?!
 The rest…
 – Where are the rest?! – Where are the rest?!
 Over there!
 – Hold it! 					– Hold it!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 – Wait! 					– Wait!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 Prepare yourself!
 Shoot, let me go! Let me go!
 Settle down!
 G-Got it!
 The money!
 Okay, they got it!
 IOU’s?!
 It’s not money?!
 – Oh no… – This is too much!
 What are you doing?! This is in the middle of town!
 Huh!
 T-Two Old Ladies?!
 You’re mixed up in this commotion as well?
 I’d like to hear your reason for it, Shizune!
 Hello… Lady Tsunade…
 What?! Shizune…
 And you guys belong to the Akagi.
 B-Boss Jirocho!
 Who?
 You don’t know?!
 He’s the number one gang boss, Jirocho from the Land of Tea!
 He’s an old friend of mine.
 As luck would have it, we met by accident on the street.
 You’re Bunzo and Senta if I’m not mistaken.
 Just in time. I have something to say to you!
 – What?! 					 – What?!
 You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?
 I paid it back a year ago.
 Is that true?
 That was last year, when we were near Akagi’s.
 Did you forget?
 I-I’m sorry.
 Hey!
 It’s a circular from Akagi addressed to me.
 I’ll just read the part addressed to you.
 “Senta and Bunzo,
 “The debt is paid, come home soon.” Signed, Shugoro Akagi.
 See?
 You've gotta be kidding.
 All that energy spent, for nothing.
 – Thank you for helping us. – Thank you for helping us.
 – Now we can go home relieved. – Now we can go home relieved.
 Go in good spirits.
 – You too, Naruto. Take care! – You too, Naruto. Take care!
 Hey, if the suitcase doesn’t have money in it,
 why were you so serious about getting it back?
 That’s…
 If the IOU’s were discovered by the people in the village,
 they’ll oppose Lady Tsunade’s installment as Hokage.
 You worry too much.
 The Hokage and the debt are unrelated.
 Not only that, she said she returned the money,
 so there’s nothing to worry about.
 At least the Akagi debt was…
 What?
 Don’t worry, don’t worry!
 What? We forgot something?
 Finally, the time has come.
 Communal bathing with girls…
 Patience paid off…
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 You're awesome, Old Lady Tsunade!
 Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke are all right now!
 You can't rejoice yet.
 The current situation in the village is serious.
 You're right. I have to do my best,
 And work hard for the village as well.
 Hey! N-Naruto, where do you think you're going?!
 I have to fill my stomach first!
 You have no sense of emergency…
 Next time: ""Tsunade's Warning: Ninja No More!""
 What is that supposed to mean?!

118,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Don’t forget your objective…
 Don’t go!
 Thank you…
 Sasuke…
 Formation!                The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!
 It’s already four o’clock in the morning…
 That Fifth Hokage is a real slave driver.
 She ought to retrieve the documents she forgot herself…
 Huh… What’s the matter?
 Hey! Wake up!
 You’ll catch cold if you sleep in a place like this.
 Thank you…
 Huh!
 Sasuke!
 Good work…
 Fifth Hokage! You were asleep just now, weren’t you?
 When you made us go to fetch the documents!
 And only you got to sleep!
 More importantly, Lady Hokage,
 there’s something I want to report to you.
 What is it?
 What did you just say?!
 Is that true?!
 Yes…
 According to Sakura Haruno, it appears that there’s no mistake…
 Unbelievable… That they should already be on the move…
 In addition to getting what I want…
 This time, I will completely destroy Leaf Village.
 So what that pervert wants...
 is the Uchiha’s powers, huh…
 Izumo! Kotetsu!
 There’s somebody I want you to bring here!
 Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru! Your Dad’s mission starts today, too!
 There’s not that much time for morning training!
 OK, OK.
 One OK is enough!
 Nag, nag, nag from early in the morning…
 I wonder who it could be so early in the morning?
 Hey…Dad…
 What is it?
 Why did you marry a hard-edged woman like Mom?
 Let’s see now…
 Even though Mom's like that, she smiles gently sometimes…
 Maybe that’s why…
 Is that the only reason?
 Shikamaru!
 A messenger of the Fifth Hokage is here.
 Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out of the village late last night.
 And…there is almost no mistake
 that he is headed for the Village Hidden in the Sound!
 Slipped out?! Why…
 Because he was enticed by that Orochimaru!
 W-W-Wait a minute!
 Why does Sasuke have to be enticed by a risky guy like that?!
 The reason doesn’t matter. ln any case, there’s no time.
 You will perform your first mission as a Chunin…
 So all I have to do is bring Sasuke back?
 As long as there aren’t any enemies around,
 that shouldn’t be too much of a hassle…
 Yes… However, not only is time of the essence on this mission,
 but it may turn into something quite difficult.
 Huh?!
 There is a strong possibility that
 those under the control of Orochimaru are guiding Sasuke.
 This is turning into a real pain in the neck.
 That guy… I held him in high respect in so many different ways…
 In that case, please give me a four-man team
 composed only of Jonin and Chunin.
 I’m afraid I can’t do that…
 Huh! Why?!
 You already know the answer to that…
 Right now, only the barest minimum number of Jonin have been left behind
 and the others have all left the village on missions.
 Within the next 30 minutes,
 I want you to gather all the Genin you consider the best, and leave this village!
 It’s a drag but…
 I know the guy, so I just can’t just let the matter go.
 What shall be, shall be…
 There’s one guy I want to recommend.
 What! You’ve gotta be kidding!
 You are such a drag starting so early in the morning…
 But why this guy?
 That jerk!
 Hey, just wait here!
 I’ll change my clothes immediately!
 So, do you have your eye…
 on any other guys besides me who are excellent?
 Yeah…
 Wake up! Hey!
 You said excellent guys, right…
 Can’t be helped…
 Potato chips?
 They’re barbecued meat flavor… you help out too!
 Huh?!
 Here he comes!
 Even if it is just potato chips,
 I won’t let anybody else have the last piece, no matter who you are.
 Choji and I have worked as a team for many years,
 so coordinating with him is easiest for me.
 I understand that,
 but in this kind of situation, one would normally solicit Shino first!
 Oh, shut up.
 Fat chance...!
 Shino is on a special mission with his father.
 Hey…don’t tell me…
 Right. He's in.
 No way...!
 I see… Sounds interesting…
 It looks like it was worth getting up early and going for a walk, doesn’t it?
 Shikamaru, what about the other guys?
 I’d like to take my time to look for some, but we’re pressed for time.
 If we don’t find anybody else by the time we leave the village,
 it will be just us!
 It appears that your operation was a success.
 Yeah…
 Is it okay for you to be released already?
 I was told that I would be able to undertake light training soon.
 I see…
 I see…
 It’s a hassle, but the more people the better…
 Damn… At a time like this, I…
 Lee! Do what you need to do.
 I’ll climb these steps alone starting tomorrow!
 Lee…
 I’ll be fine! You go!
 We’re at our time limit!
 Well, I’ve assembled five people…
 All right! Everybody, follow me!
 Hey…
 Hey, Naruto…
 I’m supposed to be the squad leader. Though it sure is a drag…
 You really think everything will be okay if things are left in your hands?
 You don’t seem very reliable…
 What’s up with you acting like the boss, Naruto?
 Although being ordered about by some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru
 doesn’t sit right with me either…
 But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!
 We have to follow his orders.
 What that means is that the elders of the village recognized him
 as capable of being a leader.
 Since that’s the case, come up with some strategy and plan.
 From what I heard, there are enemies
 and there’s a strong possibility that they’re gonna ambush us.
 For a start, as this is a rescue operation,
 we will be in the position of pursuit.
 In other words, the enemy can easily gain the initiative.
 Therefore, I will decide on a deployment formation
 that will respond quickly to any assault by the enemy.
 If you ignore me and move of your own accord,
 we will all die.
 We will go in a single file formation.
 First of all, the all-important spearhead will be…
 Kiba, that’s you!
 You and Akamaru go on walks year round
 and are therefore well-versed in the terrain and geography of the Land of Fire.
 And since your nose is very sensitive,
 you can track Sasuke with your sense of smell and,
 you can distinguish booby traps that carry the enemy’s scent
 which makes them easy to find…
 And moreover, you and Akamaru as a pair will be extremely efficient
 in compensating for the weakness of a single file formation to assault.
 And…second in line will be me, the squad leader.
 I can give orders as required in any situation
 from my position directly behind Kiba
 and can give orders to those behind me using only hand signals.
 And in the middle... in the number three position is Naruto.
 The middle position is the best for you,
 since you're capable of executing quick moves
 and are able to respond immediately to anything in front or behind.
 You're the cornerstone... And you have Shadow Clone, too.
 And fourth in line is Choji.
 You. You don't have speed,
 but your ability to strike is the best among the squad members.
 Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto will launch a surprise attack
 and I’ll use you to launch the deciding blow.
 In other words, your role is to attack the routed enemy.
 And then, on the tail end will be you, Neji…
 You are assigned to the most difficult position of rear lookout.
 You will use your Byakugan to constantly check
 that there are no loopholes in the ranks.
 Got it? Take a careful look at this.
 Use this diagram to verify the radius of your assigned watch.
 Kiba watches the front,
 I’m responsible for a wide forward view,
 Naruto watches left, Choji right, and Neji…
 Using your Byakugan, you cover the entire area to the rear.
 I want to familiarize myself with our current military potential.
 Let me check all the Ninja equipment each of you currently has…
 I will commit that to memory straight away.
 Any questions?
 Even though he just assembled his men a short while ago,
 he’s already created the best possible formation…
 If not, I want to tell you the most important thing last.
 Sasuke and I aren’t close friends.
 In fact, I don’t particularly like him.
 However, he is also a Shinobi belonging to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 He is a comrade!
 Therefore, I will put my life on the line to help him!
 That’s the way of the Leaf Village.
 In this case, even I can’t just sit back and be a sluggard.
 Because I am responsible for your lives.
 Wow… You’re acting kind of like a Chunin, aren’t you?!
 Okay then, as soon as he's checked our Ninja tools, we’ll depart.
 Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.
 Sasuke wouldn’t fall victim to that kind of guy’s enticement…
 He’s already a really powerful guy,
 so he wouldn’t need to do that kind of thing! I guarantee it!
 Damn… Why, Sasuke…?!
 All right! Let’s go!
 Wait!
 Sakura!
 I heard the whole story from Lady Hokage.
 I’m sorry, but I can’t take you along on this mission.
 Even you weren’t able to convince Sasuke, right?
 All that can be done now is for us to use force to convince him…
 Sakura, your role in this has ended.
 Which means, Sakura, that you and Sasuke…?!
 Sakura…
 Naruto… This is a… once in a lifetime request...
 Please bring… please bring Sasuke back.
 I couldn’t do it! I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!
 At this point, the only person who would be able to stop Sasuke…
 who would be able to save him…
 is you…Naruto…
 You like Sasuke so much, don’t you, Sakura?
 I understand to my very core
 how painful it must be for you right now, Sakura.
 Sakura, there’s one thing I want to ask you.
 Huh?
 How do you feel about…Naruto?
 Thwarting someone’s love seems to have become natural to him.
 He actually seems to be enjoying my suffering.
 Naruto doesn’t understand the least thing about me.
 He’s just annoying.
 Naruto…thank you…
 I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail! I promise that on my life!
 You always understood me…
 You always helped me…
 Naruto…
 Hey, hey, Naruto!
 You really think you’re gonna be okay saying that kind of thing?!
 Sure! I will not go back on my word.
 That’s my Way of the Ninja!
 All right! Let’s hurry up and go!
 We’ve lost a little time… Let’s hurry!
 OK!
 Naruto struck the pose of a nice guy as he said that…
 It’ll all be all right now.
 I’m positive… I’m positive that it will all go well!
 Master Sasuke… Around here will do, don’t you think?
 We’ve already exited the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 What is that?
 To tell you the truth,
 Orochimaru has given us one important task…
 So…what is it?
 It will be necessary for you to die once…
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 From here on up, there's more danger of traps and ambushes.
 – Stay alert and use all your senses. – Roger that!
 – Find the enemy before he gets you. – You can count on me!
 – And any signs of the enemy-- – Right!
 Say, are you listening?!
 Not to worry. No matter who the enemy may be,
 I'll thrash him with my new technique!
 I'm a fool to even attempt to explain.

119,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Wow. There’s a lot of new houses being built around here.
 I hear it’s been a bit of a construction boom recently.
 Seems like a lot of the construction sites are short-handed
 and they’re hiring carpenters from people outside of the country, too.
 Even I know that.
 Oh, Old Man Genno!
 Oh… Naruto.
 Who is he?
 He’s a carpenter from the Land of Sand.
 He likes ramen, and we bump into each other at Ichiraku.
 How about we go there after this?
 Yeah!
 Here you go, thanks for waiting!
 Thank you for this meal!
 Thank you.
 Ichiraku’s ramen is the best, after all!
 Isn’t it so? Isn’t it so?
 I’m sorry, but can I have some water…?
 Sure!
 Thank you for this meal!
 That was fast!
 Are you full already?
 No… Not really…
 Then, I’ll give you mine.
 Lucky!
 Hey, Naruto!
 The two of them are always like this.
 They act as if they’re really grandfather and grandson.
 Oh come on, Sakura, stop being so harsh.
 There’re lots of other people who complain. Like Grandma Tsunade.
 And there’s Shino, Ino, Kiba, and Kakashi Sensei…
 But I guess you're the harshest, Sakura.
 Come on, Naruto!
 That’s only because you’re always at fault!
 Now, now, Sakura calm down. You hair will turn gray… Ouch!
 – Looks like it’s time – Just leave it and eat up already!
 – I got to business… – But I got nothing left!
 – Hey, hey. – Help me, Old Man Genno!
 Crisis The Hidden Leaf 11 Gather
 Damn!
 What is it? Fog?
 Well, I guess it doesn’t matter…
 Lady Tsunade.
 I’m sorry to bother you during your sleep,
 but the man that the Anbu Black Ops have had marked…
 Has made his move?
 He is currently on the run.
 On the run?
 Are you telling me even with the array of the Anbu Black Ops,
 we still can’t catch him?
 Who is he?
 You must know his identity by now.
 There was nobody in the recent Bingo Book
 that fit his description,
 but when we checked an older Bingo Book…
 Genno?
 Genno the Trapper?
 You do know of him?
 He should be quite old by now.
 I hadn’t heard his name in a while,
 so I thought that he had already retired, but…
 I never would have thought that he was infiltrating the Leaf Village.
 I guess I can’t fight against old age.
 No… I guess I should say this is just what I expect of the Leaf Anbu Black Ops.
 We want you to hand over the thing you took from the master carpenter’ house.
 You think I would still be holding onto that thing?
 I've had a long life as a Shinobi…
 I guess it wouldn’t be so bad to close the curtain at this time.
 Though I regret that I won’t be able to see
 the end of the Leaf Village with my own eyes!
 Paper Bombs!
 Retreat!
 Are you saying that someone
 is planning a huge attack against the Leaf Village?!
 That would be the only reason anyone would want those plans
 besides carpentry purposes.
 Genno’s last words suggest that as well.
 It’s going to take some time to decipher those plans,
 but it’s too dangerous to depend on that.
 The enemy may attack us any minute.
 Activate the S-Level Emergency Security Alert!
 Leave the least amount of men necessary here,
 and all other men are to secure the border!
 Attack anyone who tries to cross the border!
 Don’t allow them to attack the village, no matter what!
 Such great weather!
 Naruto!
 Oh! Sakura!
 That sound like a big pain in the ass.
 I think you’ll be able to do it. That is why we left you in the village.
 At the very least, is there any way that we can get more people?
 Under these circumstances, we can’t turn over more people to you.
 They’re the greatest line-up for you, aren’t they?
 The greatest…huh?
 Fog? Last night’s weather didn’t seem like it was going to be foggy.
 How strange… Was it all a dream?
 Doesn’t it seem like we’re really low on people?
 That’s what I was thinking, too.
 From the looks of it,
 the village must be under special security alert.
 What?! For real?! I didn’t notice it!
 You should notice these kinds of things. You’re a Ninja.
 But if we’re in a state of emergency,
 it’s a huge deal for the village, isn’t it?
 Why haven’t they told us anything?
 That’s why Lady Tsunade is calling us.
 Come in.
 Lady Tsunade, I brought Naruto.
 Shikamaru…
 So you must’ve been left out, too.
 Huh? What are you taking about?
 Nothing…
 Oh, hey Shikamaru. About last night’s weird fog…
 Did you see it?
 Stop it. You were just dreaming.
 There was no fog.
 See. I told you…
 That was a smoke screen.
 Smoke screen?
 I’ll explain once everyone gets here.
 – Huh? 					– Naruto, Sakura…
 The reason why we left you out of
 the S-Level Emergency Security Alert unit
 is because we wanted you to work under Shikamaru
 for a special mission.
 What?
 Well, that’s the case.
 First, I want you to gather the people I’m about to name.
 Hey, calm down, Naruto!
 But it’s already past the time we were supposed to gather!
 Not quite. To be accurate, we still have twenty more seconds.
 Seems like he’s here.
 Oh? Everyone’s already here?
 No matter how you look at it, you’re the last one!
 Everyone’s here now. Then let’s begin.
 I’m sure that you all have already noticed.
 The village is currently under the S-Level Emergency Security Alert.
 It all started when…
 The smoke screen last night, right?
 You guys noticed it?
 Of course.
 The bugs were being noisy…
 Huh? I didn’t notice it.
 You’re always so out of it!
 SAME LEVEL AS CHOJI! 		I didn’t notice it either…
 WORSE THAN NARUTO!! 		Could it be then that 		I’m worse than Naruto?
 Worse than Naruto… Worse than Naruto… Worse than Naruto…
 So what was that?
 It seemed like something involving the Anbu Black Ops.
 So I stayed put…
 Yeah, that’s correct. The Anbu Black Ops were involved.
 Just as I thought…
 It was late last night.
 A man that the Anbu Black Ops had been marking for the past two weeks
 had snuck into the home of Leaf Village’s top carpenter boss…
 And he stole the plans of our village’s important facilities from the secret safe.
 Plans…?
 So what’s so bad about that?
 He just stole the plans for the facilities, right?
 Just stole? You’re so…
 Naruto…
 For example, let’s say the plans for the fort that surrounds the village
 fell into enemy hands…
 By analyzing those plans in detail,
 the enemy could figure out the most efficient way
 to break into the village.
 Now let’s say that there were plans for Lady Tsunade’s mansion.
 If you were to examine those plans,
 you could find out how to get the Lady Tsunade’s room.
 And if the plans were to get into the hands of an assassin…
 That’s really, really bad.
 Last night’s smoke screen was…
 something that suspect spread as he was running away.
 I see…
 In the end, Anbu Black Ops cornered him in the Western Forest…
 He killed himself before they could get him to talk.
 Unfortunately, when he committed suicide,
 he wasn't in possession of the plans he had stolen.
 If the plans have already fallen into the hands of the enemy…
 it'd be a re-enactment of the nightmare of the Destruction of Leaf Village.
 In order to prevent that from happening
 The S-Level Emergency Security Alert was deployed this morning.
 So, what is the mission for those of us who were left behind?
 Find out the location of the stolen plans and bring them back.
 That's our mission.
 It’s like finding a needle in a haystack.
 We just need to investigate the path he took
 and people he was acquainted with.
 It turns out that the guy was famous for being a top-level trap technician.
 It’s a huge possibility that he left traps where the plans are.
 It’s definitely plausible.
 I understand. We’ll follow your instructions.
 I’ll do it.
 Then let’s start the investigation.
 Turns out that the man had snuck into the village
 a few months ago and worked as a carpenter.
 Th-This guy…
 His name is…Genno
 You’re kidding me.
 There’s no way! Old Man Genno loved the ramen at Ichiraku!
 He would never do anything that would destroy the Hidden Leaf Village!
 Listen… There’s no way that a guy who’s sneaking in to an enemy village
 would show his bad side.
 He played the part of a good guy to let people’s guard down.
 There is no way that anyone who loves ramen could be a bad person!
 No. That’s not true Naruto.
 Choji… You tell him. Put some sense into this guy.
 Anyone who loves Ichiraku’s ramen can't be a bad person!
 Choji!
 Gosh, I can’t depend on anybody…
 This is a list of the stolen plans.
 I'm so embarrassed we lost our important plans…
 I can’t show my face to Lady Tsunade.
 Which construction jobs were Genno involved with?
 None of them.
 But wasn’t he working under you?
 I don’t allow outsiders to work on any construction
 that involves the safety of the village.
 That old man only worked on residential construction.
 Which means…
 There’s little possibility that he snuck some traps into the construction.
 I think it’s impossible.
 We should check everything, just in case…
 I’m counting on you.
 Lady Hinata, please take care of these.
 Y-Yes!
 I’ll go too.
 Me too.
 I’ve mentioned it earlier, but there is a possibility
 the the plans haven't fallen into the enemy's hands yet.
 It’s possible that he could have hidden it while he was running away.
 And it’s our mission to find that.
 Understood.
 It’s the start of a treasure hunt. I’m depending on you Akamaru.
 Go!
 Ino and Sakura, you guys go check the old man's body.
 There might be some clues.
 What?! Us?
 I got it.
 All right! You just want me to go right?! I’ll go!
 Sakura, are you really okay with this?
 I have to be. I’m training to become a Medical Ninja.
 I can’t be afraid of something like this.
 That might be the case for you, but…
 Now…master carpenter.
 Can you tell us everything you know about Old Man Genno?
 The old man came to Leaf Village about three months ago…
 He came to my place with a recommendation letter
 from a famous master carpenter from the Land of Sand.
 As you may already know,
 there’s a bit of a construction boom in Leaf Village.
 Every place is in need of more people.
 And we needed more hands ourselves,
 so we decided to hire him right away.
 His carpeting skills… were all right, just average.
 I didn’t feel the urge to hire him permanently,
 nor did I feel like I wanted to fire him right away.
 He took his job seriously.
 He was perfect to hire when we were short on people.
 But after a while,
 I found out that the recommendation letter he brought was a fake.
 This is the recommendation letter he brought.
 And how is this a fake?
 There was a guy who brought a recommendation letter
 from the same master carpenter more than ten years ago.
 I just happen to find that recommendation letter,
 so I compared it and I noticed that the handwriting was different…
 And that recommendation letter?
 It’s over there in that cabinet…
 Oh? Where did I put it? I know I put it here…
 It’s okay if you don’t have it.
 I’m sorry.
 For us, we really didn’t care if his recommendation letter was a fake
 as long as he didn’t do anything bad.
 I just thought that I should let things like this be known to Lady Tsunade…
 I didn’t think that the old man was
 a Shinobi from another country and that he would steal our plans…
 I still can’t believe it.
 Hey, is it really that old man’s doing?
 I can’t believe it either.
 There're no signs of traps…
 All right.
 This is where the old man lived, huh?
 He always paid the rent on time.
 He really was quite proper…
 Once in a while he’d come home after drinking with his carpenter friends,
 but he would never cause trouble.
 Well, I did predict it, but there are no clues…
 I found it!
 What did you find?
 A special bonito broth, refreshing udon and light broth super thin udon!
 We’re not looking for food!
 But usually if somebody is living by himself,
 he’d probably stack up on a bit more food…
 There’s only instant cup-udon.
 Didn’t he eat out a lot? I hear that he went to Ichiraku a lot…
 Right, Naruto?
 Oh… Yeah.
 If he cooked himself, he could have eaten more and saved money…
 Choji, we’re not talking about you.
 That old man barely talked about himself…
 Just as I expected.
 Oh, but he did happily talk about
 how he became friends with one of the kids in the village.
 He might have heard something from the old man.
 Oh, I wonder about that.
 What you mean you wonder about that?
 We won’t know until we find the kid and question him, won’t we?
 But it seems like there’s no need for us to look for him or question him.
 What?! Then, where is this guy!
 Idiot, that kid is you, Naruto!
 What?! Me?!
 Yeah, there’s no mistake about that.
 You’re Naruto Uzumaki?
 Huh?
 We want you to talk with us for a bit.
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 I wonder what kind of interrogation Naruto is undergoing?
 I guess they would use Regressive Hypnosis or something.
 What’s Regressive Hypnosis?
 It’s a Jutsu to draw out subconscious memories.
 Then Naruto might know something even with his bad memory.
 Hmm. I wonder about that.
 Well, this Old Man Genno sounds like he was pretty tricky…
 Wait, why are you here anyway?

 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Ah, which way is it?!
 There’s a faint scent of salt water…
 We were almost there…
 Then I’ll use my Rasengan to…
 Wait! If it doesn’t go well, we’ll be crushed under the ceiling.
 If so, what should we do?!
 Everyone, step backward.
 What?!
 Phew, we’re safe…!
 Anko Sensei!
 Let’s get moving… lt’s already morning.
 Oh no!
 The ships collecting funds are in danger…!
 We’ve got to follow them right away!
 With that ship!
 Okay, let’s go!
 You’ve had no contact from the Ninja of the Leaf Village?
 They were told to accompany the ship.
 What in the world happened?
 Captain, we just received communication.
 I see!
 That’s what I expect from elite Ninja!
 It seems they finished
 the suppression of the Demon of the Ocean last night.
 – Oh… 					– Oh!
 Excellent… So now the ships are safe.
 Of course. Men, take your positions!
 We’ll depart.
 Despair: A Fractured Heart
 Be careful of the reef!
 I don’t see any ships that look like those that collect funds in the port.
 How could they depart without us?
 Have they already fallen into Amachi’s scheme…?
 C-Captain Hitode…
 What happened?!
 There’s something there! The bottom of the ship…!
 Confirm the enemy!
 R-Roger!
 Huh? What?
 Full toward port!
 I can’t steer!
 What?
 It’s no good. It won’t move.
 We’re going to hit, everyone. Grab onto something!
 This must be the attack from the Demon of the Ocean?
 Thank you for working hard for transporting the funds.
 I saw you while ago!
 Identify yourself!
 If you hand this ship over without resistance,
 I will save your life.
 Don’t mess with me!
 – It’s the Demon of the Ocean… – A monster!
 Demon Illusion: Fire Jutsu.
 Wh-What…?
 Th-That’s…
 It’s fire torture…!
 Yoroi, take care of the rest.
 What?!
 I’m your opponent!
 Everyone, hang in there!
 Don’t be so nasty!
 We meet again, weirdo!
 Excuse me, but I still have something to ask you.
 What are you doing, Isaribi!
 Cut it out already!
 Keep this up and you’ll really turn into the Demon of the Ocean!
 Do it, Isaribi.
 Your opponent is right here.
 You said that Orochimaru left
 that research facility half a month ago…
 Where did he go?
 I don’t know…
 Now that you mention it, Orochimaru had a kid in tow.
 I heard that the kid is really excellent, unlike you.
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Something about you just wasn’t enough.
 That’s why you were abandoned, I guess.
 Isarirbi?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Isaribi…
 I bet you still understand what I’ve been saying to you, Isaribi!
 Don’t you care a bit after tormenting everyone this much?
 No.
 I think nothing of… even bringing you down…
 That’s a lie!
 It doesn’t matter to me who gets injured…
 or who drowns…
 I’m satisfied as long as I can return to being a human!
 It’s about time to come to yourself!
 I understand painfully enough how you feel…
 But…doing that… lt’s not good!
 Isaribi, you saved me. You have a kind heart!
 Pretty good for a Medical Ninja.
 Shut up!
 I’m a little surprised that
 you had enough time to take your eyes off…
 D-Damn it!
 You’re too confident…
 You’re useless.
 How long you think you’ll be doing this?
 Amachi…
 He’s just a kid.
 Why can’t you finish him off right away?
 Sorry. But…
 I can’t take it anymore. Get out of my way!
 Bring it on. I’ll kill a damn monster like you!
 Monster? Me?
 That’s right!
 You so easily injure and kill people.
 You’re a monster wearing human skin!
 Hey! What’s so funny!
 If so, what then?
 I’m not some half-monster like Isaribi…
 I’m…
 further refined than her and fully integrated for combat use!
 You…!
 Amachi…!
 Get out of my way!
 You’re an almost-dead guinea pig…
 What are you doing?!
 Even though we were supposed to dissect and use her as material for experiments,
 we took pity on her and kept her alive.
 But after all, she’s terribly ungrateful and useless.
 What’s wrong…kid?
 You! You’re not only a monster in body and soul!
 In truth, you’re scum!
 C’mere… I’ll play with you.
 Bastard!
 Idiot!
 Hah, amateurish…
 Not over yet!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu
 No matter how many times you come at me,
 you’ll get the same thing!
 Well, what’s wrong, little guy?
 You’re going to come again, huh?
 Yeah, of course! Until you change Isaribi back…
 I’ll come at you again and again.
 Water Style: Great Cannonball Jutsu!
 What’s wrong, you’re done already?
 Give it up already, kid!
 I told you!
 Until I take Isaribi back…
 I absolutely will not…quit!
 Why…
 would you go that far to save me?
 I can’t keep up with the farce.
 Come on! Sea Monster!
 Do it…Sea Monster!
 Hey! Let go of me, you!
 Let me tell you that almost all of Sea Monster’s body is made of water.
 You can say it's like a moving Water Prison Jutsu.
 Naruto!
 Damn…
 You’re stupid.
 Do you think something like that will affect it at all?
 Do you understand, Isaribi?
 I am the only one who can save you.
 Now, finish them off!
 What’s wrong?
 You want to turn back into a human, don’t you?
 Then do as I say!
 It’s no good…
 It’s no good…
 I can’t let Isaribi… go to…that world…
 This feeling…
 SEAL
 What?! What are these extraordinary Chakras?
 S-Sea Monster!
 Isaribi…
 I will never let Isaribi go over there!
 What are you…?!
 Naruto…?!
 He’s the same as you.
 Same as me…?!
 Yes…
 The Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit, who long ago attacked our village,
 is sealed inside Naruto.
 And there was a time
 when everyone in the village treated him like a monster.
 And…
 And even so, he works so hard, everybody approves of him.
 I understand painfully enough how you feel…
 But…doing that… lt's not good.
 Those words…were true…
 Naruto!
 You bastard!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.

 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Oh, I was able to do the Chief Toad summoning
 for the first time in a while!
 Now, prepare yourself, you flabby jerk!
 Tomorrow will never come for you again!
 This itches!
 What? It’s not a good time to be getting scared now!
 It really itches.
 Now, Chief Toad, take him out good.

 I could take your life for this!

 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left

 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears

 Are you going to run away from me?!
 Yo…loser.

 It’s you this time, huh?
 I couldn’t do it. I was not able to stop Sasuke…
 I think… the one who can stop Sasuke…
 the one who can save Sasuke is…
 Naruto…you are the only one.
 Naruto…this is my… once in a lifetime…favor to ask…
 Please… Please bring Sasuke back!
 I also told this to Sakura, but…
 Don’t mind me anymore.
 What's with that face?
 Iruka Sensei, why on the earth does an outstanding person like me
 have to be on the same team with him?
 Sasuke graduated with the highest grade out of all students…
 Naruto, you are at the bottom!
 When you even out the team’s strength,
 then it naturally becomes like this.
 Try your best not to slow me down, you dunce.
 I am fine without eating! I am absolutely fine.
 I’m…fine…
 Here.
 You asked Sakura for a hint the other day, what did she tell you?
 Shall we go?
 Yup.
 Wh-What’s with that face…?
 You loser…
 Why…?
 You… I hated you, you know.
 It’s none of your business!
 Who knows, my body moved on its own.
 You rescue Sakura, no matter what!
 Sasuke… You…
 I could still distract him for a little while…
 I lost everything once.
 I don’t want to see my precious comrades die in front of me anymore.
 Why…?
 Why is it…Sasuke?
 Why did you become like this?!
 You!
 Whatever happens to me, what does that have to do with you?
 I have my own way.
 No matter who it is,
 nobody has the right to tell me what to do.
 I will tell you the truth.
 I’m done fooling around with you guys of the Leaf.
 Go home.
 I’ll take care of him!
 Choji…
 Go everyone!
 Go, quickly! I’ll catch up with you.
 Neji…
 Okay!
 Hold on!
 Kiba…
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Now! Naruto!
 Shikamaru…
 The strategy…a success!
 What are you doing? Please go quickly!
 You also promised Sakura with a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.
 Bushy Brow…
 I’ll defeat this person.
 It’s a promise.
 Everyone…
 Everyone risked their lives to come after you, you know!
 Good job for them.
 Lastly, I will tell you the most important thing.
 Sasuke is neither a close friend of mine nor is he someone I like.
 But Sasuke is a Shinobi of the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 A comrade.
 That’s why we will rescue him by risking our lives.
 This is the Leaf way.
 How do you take your comrades of the Leaf ?!
 Comrades, you said…
 Did I become stronger staying with those so-called comrades?
 I am going to where Orochimaru is.
 Orochimaru is the person who killed the Third Hokage
 and tried to crush The Leaf Village!
 Do you think he will give you the power freely?
 He just wants your body as a vessel!
 You might not be able to come back. You might get killed.
 You think I’d easily let you go to such a place?!
 That doesn’t matter to me…
 If my goal is accomplished, then that’s all that matters.
 If you intend to get in that way…
 Then it can’t be helped…
 You’re not gonna be able to! I’ll take you back even by force!
 Why are you laughing?!
 You were laughing at that time too.
 That time…?
 What’s funny?
 It’s not funny. I am happy.
 Thinking about… how I can finally defeat you here.
 That time you wanted to fight me, right?
 You were thrilled weren’t you?
 At first!
 But, you were different.
 That was…
 Hurry up and come.
 But first, put on your Headband. I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just put it on!
 You won’t be able to put one scratch on my face.
 That’s not it!
 I’m saying that this is a sign that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.
 That is what I call a stuck up!
 You think you and I are equal?
 Yeah, I think so.
 I’ve never thought I was inferior to you.
 You’re so obnoxious!
 Stop!
 That was…
 That was not the kind of fight I wanted.
 Even now…this is not…
 I don’t care about your circumstances.
 What…is this power?
 Power is flowing out…
 So this is the power that the guy was talking about.
 Furthermore, the power is growing into my body.
 If it is like that now… if I release this curse mark…
 I wonder how much power…
 Wh-What power…
 He’s not the same as before…
 Wake up already!
 I awakened long ago…
 From my idiotic self who dreams about a lax peaceful future…
 hanging out with comrades.
 That’s why I left the village!
 That’s why I sought power!
 My dream is not in the future.
 My dream is in the past…
 That’s the only place it exists.
 Wow, Brother!
 You hit the target right in the middle, even the one behind the rock!
 All right, me too!
 Sasuke, let’s go home.
 Geez… You said that you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.
 There is an important mission tomorrow and I need to prepare for that.
 Liar…
 Forgive me, Sasuke… Another time.
 Brother, watch me!
 Hey! If you push yourself…
 Why is the one who twisted his ankle laughing?
 Could it be that you are trying to take the easy way?
 That’s not true...
 I’m happy thinking about
 how I’m finally going to the Academy starting tomorrow.
 I’m going to do my best when I enter the Academy.
 So even that father will approve of me.
 He will count on me like he does on my brother…
 Sasuke… You really are…
 I told you…
 I don’t need a future with you guys anymore.

 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you

 For the first time, I was able to speak

 For the first time, I was able to speak

 Oh, thanks.
 Wh-What’s this?
 What the heck’s the idea, you guys…? This isn’t a picnic.
 I’m sorry.
 Come on, it’s okay, right?
 A cinch mission just the three of us can manage.
 You yourself said you weren’t fired up, right?
 I’m not fired up!
 It’s a mission to catch a petty thief.
 It’d be the same no matter who went on the mission.
 Look. Under normal circumstances,
 a three-man team of Kiba, Hinata and Shino would be fundamental.
 But unfortunately, Shino is absent as he’s off on a different mission.
 It’d be better if even you were there than not, right?
 What, Old Lady?! That’s taking it too far!
 I’ll do my best.
 This is a mission I kind of can’t get into, though.
 There’s probably no need to take the trouble to determine a troop leader.
 Anyway, your mission is to capture the man who stole…
 the Misogi tea jar owned by the feudal lord of the Land of Tea.
 This man, Gosunkugi.
 According to sources, he’s now hiding in the Land of Stone.
 Get over there lickety-split and catch him lickety-split.
 Hearing that makes me feel less fired up than ever.
 Here, Akamaru.
 Well, missions like this are okay once in a while, right?
 Let’s take it easy.
 It's a cinch mission, so all the more reason I want to finish it up quick.
 What’ll happen if the Pervy Sage comes back while I’m gone?
 I’m sorry, Naruto.
 I…um, I was so happy to be on a mission…with you.
 Huh? What did you say, Hinata? I can’t hear you.
 What’re you blushing for? You’re a weird one.
 Well, hold your horses… Look.
 We’ll be in the Land of Stone once we cross that mountain pass.
 Be sure to fortify yourself with food by then.
 It’s kind of complicated when it’s like eating myself.
 Hey, this is good!
 Hinata, you’d make a great wife!
 What?

 This doesn’t feel like we’ll be able to do this lickety-split.
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Could it be that Gosunkugi guy is among them?
 Got you, Gosunkugi!
 It’s a photo.

 Three million ryo?
 What’s the meaning of this?
 Look…They’re hanging over there, and here, too.
 All right, I’ll try asking someone.
 Asia Saloon
 Hello!
 Can I help you?
 I have something I’d like to ask you.
 What, if you’re not a customer, beat it.
 Then I’ll order something… I’ll have ramen.
 I’ll have a hamburger steak with cheese. He’ll have milk.
 This is funny. Milk? Hamburger steak with cheese?
 And ramen on top of that?
 Are you making a fool of me? Get out, brats!
 If it’s the money, we have some.
 That’s not the issue.
 Oh… It’s dangerous for kids to carry such a large amount of money…
 I’ll take charge of it for you.
 After all, there are lots of bad men in this town.
 Hey, what’re you doing? Are you still in?
 Oh, just a minute. I got the money. I’ll be right over.
 Huh? What’s with you? Hey, let go!
 You’re the one who’ll let go.
 How about that?
 You brat… You want to fight?!
 That’s the plan… Bring it!
 You punk!
 Hold it, Naruto.
 Naruto, look around.
 This is bad.
 Master, milk.
 Who the hell are you?
 O-Okay, coming right up!
 Here you are.
 Thanks.
 Now, no need to hesitate. Drink up.
 It’s a treat from old billiard-ball head over there.
 ""Billiard-ball head"" means me? Knock it off, you jerk!
 Who would treat some puppy milk?
 You want to get killed?!
 Bounty, Michizo Manaka.
 You can take the credit, Master.
 Take the money for the milk from his bounty…
 And the money to repair the table, too. I don’t need change.
 He’s strong.
 Are you in the same trade as I am? Sorry about that.
 Wait!
 Something you want?
 Who the heck are you, old man?
 ""Old man,"" you say?
 I’m Sazanami, a bounty hunter.
 How cool!
 Old man!
 Say, say… That thing earlier was cool.
 Hm? The iai-nuki?
 It was so fast I couldn’t see when you drew your sword.
 It was really surprising…
 I bet that’s what they mean when they say “In a blink of an eye.”
 Life and death is on the line for us bounty hunters…
 No matter how many lives we can have, it wouldn't be enough
 if we couldn’t draw our sword faster than others.
 Say, say! Say, say! What’s a bounty hunter?
 Let’s see…
 There are people who offer a bounty in order to capture bad guys.
 And a bounty hunter catches those bad guys and receives the bounty.
 Hmm.
 Then this guy has a bounty on him, right?
 Boy, that’s…
 Why’s there so much money on his head?
 This guy’s just a simple thief…
 A simple thief, you say?
 Boy, this guy’s a super A-rank bounty
 who has killed dozens of people for the sake of stealing.
 What?!
 No way.
 Say what?
 What’s the meaning of this? I haven’t heard about that.
 The feudal lord who commissioned this mission
 might not have known about that.
 Mission?
 Yeah. We’re Hidden Leaf Ninja
 and we came to this town to capture Gosunkugi.
 Leaf?
 So you’re Ninja, huh?
 This is interesting.
 So even kids like this are qualified to be Ninja?
 What?! Don’t make fun of us!
 Well, don’t get so mad. Sorry about that…
 I’ll treat you guys to something. Milk?
 We’re not Akamaru. I want ramen!
 Then I’ll have a hamburger steak with cheese.
 I-I-I guess I’ll have ramen, too.
 Okay. Come with me.
 Jeez, no way would there be ramen in a bar.
 Hey, old man. Would even miso ramen topped with pork be okay?
 Sure, have anything you like.
 What is this? We’re rapidly moving away from town.
 I don’t see a ramen shop anywhere.
 Now then…
 I don’t see any ramen shops.
 So what I said earlier about treating you guys is canceled.
 Sorry, but you guys are going to die here.
 O-Old man…
 You guys are going to die here.
 Hey, old man…What’s the idea?
 To think you guys would know that Gosunkugi is in this town.
 So what if we do know?
 Gosunkugi is my prey… I can’t hand him over to you.
 Knock it off! You should just go get him yourself.
 No, even if you guys are kids,
 it’s a different story when it comes to Leaf Ninjas.
 It’s better to have fewer… wait, no competitors.
 Old man.
 Here I go.
 Hinata!
 That’s dirty!
 Naruto!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry: All-Four Jutsu!
 Interesting.
 Bring it.
 I won’t lose at speed!
 Damn it! Where are you?
 Too slow.
 Boy…
 Now you’re the last one.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Oh…
 I won’t let you do as you please!
 Over here!
 You’re mine.
 Almost.
 Forgive me, boy.
 I’ll be the one to defeat him, no matter what.
 Akamaru.
 Damn it! He got us good.
 Hinata, you okay?
 Y-Yeah.
 Where’s Sazanami?
 Could it be he went after Gosunkugi?
 I can’t just sit here like this! He’ll beat us to the draw.
 Damn it! Where is that old man?
 Did he leave town?
 Going after Gosunkugi?
 Akamaru, we’re counting on you!
 The most crucial treasure is missing here.
 Filthy hyena.
 I waited a long time for you to make your move.
 Unfortunately, I have an important job to do.
 Time is valuable. I’ll get right to taking care of you.
 Ninja Art: Torpedo Nail.
 Gosunkugi, here I come!
 You can’t move anymore.
 It’s over.
 Finish him.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Gosunkugi, you’re under arrest!
 Damn it. Reinforcements, huh?
 Retreat!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Wait.
 Boy…
 You must not go.
 Old man!
 H-Hey, Old Man Sazanami.
 Stay away from him. He’s too much for you guys.
 How could such a strong guy be beaten?
 Gosunkugi isn’t a mere thief.
 He’s a Shinobi, same as us.
 Shinobi.
 Sazanami!
 Is this one of Gosunkugi’s comrades?
 You! As I recall, you were in the bar before…
 Damn!
 Who was that guy?
 Hm, what?
 A wanted flyer.
 Did he mistake us for Gosunkugi?
 No, that’s not it.
 ""This man who calls himself Tokichi is a major criminal
 who has killed a family of three…""
 ""He has a bird-shaped birthmark on his chest.""
 A bird-shaped birthmark…? lt couldn’t be…
 What is it, Hinata?
 I can't tell because his face is covered with scars…
 But he has…a bird-shaped birthmark.
 Oh!
 He has a bounty on his head, too?
 What the heck is going on with everything?
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 A long, long time ago just recently, on an overcast clear day…
 It was night since morning.
 The righteous rogue Sazanami’s string of his past unwinds and frays.
 Ah, the fatal foe Gosunkugi!
 Although the situation is now clear to me,
 there are times when a Shinobi cannot back out!
 Hey, hey, hey, Gosunkugi!
 Give it up and submit to arrest!
 Next time: “Hunt or Be Hunted?! Showdown at the OK Temple”

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart

 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,

 Sakura's Determination
 Where’s Sasuke! Where did you put him?!
 Heh! You’re Naruto, right?
 You wouldn’t believe anything I said anyway, would you…?
 That’s right! I won’t believe that Sasuke’s dead!
 Naruto…
 That’s right. Sasuke is alive.
 I’ll bring Sasuke back!
 I made that promise!
 Naruto…
 In that case, take me down!
 If I were the wimp I was in the past,
 I would probably have told you the truth.
 Arashi!
 No! The old Arashi is dead!
 The person you see here is just a block of flesh
 kept alive by Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!
 Sakura, please look after Sasame!
 Stop it, Naruto! Don’t fight with Arashi!
 No!
 This guy isn’t the same gentle Arashi you once knew, Sasame!
 Jigumo! Go!
 No!
 Sasame! I'm sorry!
 Over here!
 Naruto!
 Don’t, Sakura!
 Kamikiri…!
 Finish him!
 Naruto!
 You’re…next…!
 Sakura!
 That was close…
 I almost let my guard down.
 Just when you had a chance to launch a sneak attack.
 You blew it, didn’t you, Naruto?
 Naruto!
 All because of that ball and chain…!
 Ball and chain…?!
 Naruto… I'm sorry!
 That’s not true at all!
 This kind of injury…
 is nothing…at all!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 If there’s three on your side,
 I'll go with five on mine!
 Kamikiri!
 Naruto!
 Are you all right?!
 You’re badly hurt…
 Sakura… This injury is nothing!
 “Sakura…This injury is nothing!”
 Stop it! If you say more than that…!
 I won’t say more! I’ll bring this to an end.
 Kamikiri! Jigumo!
 Give me your Chakra…
 Boar, Dog, Rat, Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,
 Dog, Monkey, Dragon, Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon…
 Why does Arashi know that technique?
 It’s a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs of the Fuma clan could use…
 What was that?!
 Fuma Ninja Art:
 Spell of the Mandala!
 This ain’t good!
 Naruto!
 What the heck is this?!
 This is the end!
 What?!
 Naruto!
 The Chakra cage gradually shrinks…
 And the human enclosed therein is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.
 You can’t break it.
 As long as I myself do not dissolve the Jutsu.
 Naruto!
 I’m incapable of doing anything…
 There’s nothing I’m capable of doing…
 The person I am now isn’t…
 capable of doing anything!
 Arashi!
 Sasame…
 You!
 Sasame!
 Please…come to your senses…
 Become the old Arashi again!
 I told you, already!
 The old Arashi is dead.
 Arashi…
 I’m sorry, Sasame…
 I wanted power…
 I wanted the Fuma Clan to find a place in the sun once again…
 Yes! I understand that! I understand that!
 But, enough now… Let’s go home.
 Let’s go back to the village.
 But, I’m just a mere monster now…
 That’s not true!
 This is agony…
 Sassme…
 Please… kill me…
 Please…kill…
 How dare you try to kill me!
 Arashi!
 You’ll…die!
 Sakura!
 Sakura?!
 You wanna be… the first to die?
 Sasame taught me that…
 dying isn’t anything to be scared of!
 I see…
 But what’s scary is to live one’s life without having been able to do anything…
 I’m not afraid to die in the service of someone who is important to me!
 Don’t!
 I’m telling you…
 Whatever happens, you mustn’t die… No matter what! Sakura!
 Naruto!
 Give it up!
 What is it you think you’re capable of doing the way you are now?!
 That’s so useless!
 Vanish from this world get crushed into nothing…!
 Sasame!
 Stop that, Arashi!
 Sasame…you!
 Naruto!
 Hey! Let go!
 No!
 Arashi?!
 I’m sorry, Sasame…
 I caused you so much hardship…
 No, you haven’t!
 The person who experienced the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!
 Is there anything I can do for you?
 What should I do for you?!
 You’ve already helped me more than enough…
 See… Thanks to you, Sasame,
 I was able to return to being the person I was in the past…
 Naruto!
 Sakura…
 Even if it’s to be of service to someone…
 There’s no life that should be lost for that!
 Yeah!
 Run! Sakura!
 Pervy Sage!
 Sorry to be late!
 I was faced with a number of obstacles on my end too!
 Gimme a break…
 Now then… Climb on, climb on!
 Hurry! Let’s get back above ground!
 Oops!
 Sasame!
 She’s fine… She just fainted.
 Naruto!
 Orochimaru assigned us a mission…
 To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back
 to the Village Hidden in the Leaves under any circumstances!
 Then, Sasuke is…?!
 Yeah… He’s alive!
 Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke
 because he is his vital vessel which he will possess in three years!
 Arashi…
 Arashi… This place is gonna collapse!
 Hurry up and come over here!
 I’m already just a puppet…
 I cannot live my life anywhere except here.
 Arashi…
 All right!
 No! Arashi!
 Sasame…
 Thank you.
 Including Arashi, we’ve paid an extraordinary price but…
 The Fuma Clan has been able to cut itself free
 from Orochimaru’s spell…
 You can start again anew.
 I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!
 With this life… that Arashi protected.
 Yeah!
 I am truly indebted to you.
 Sasame…
 Hanzaki, I’m leaving these two in your hands!
 Yes, sir! Please take care along the road!
 I will.
 – Thank you! – We thank you!
 – Take care! – See you again!
 Hey! Hang in there!
 Well, we weren’t able to find Sasuke,
 but at least we now know that he’s alive somewhere…
 We’ll have to settle for the fact that we were able to ascertain
 the new information that we still have a grace period of three years
 before he becomes a vessel to be possessed by Orochimaru.
 Yes…
 Sasame knew what she needed to do for her clan…
 But this time again all I did was cry.
 All I did was depend on Naruto…
 Sakura!
 You gave your best effort too!
 No, I was just a ball and chain to everyone…
 I wasn’t capable of doing anything alone…
 That’s not true!
 Seeing you give your best effort like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.
 If you hadn’t been there, Sakura, I’d have been crushed just like that.
 It’s thanks to you, Sakura!
 Naruto…
 Wow, you’ve grown into someone who can say that sort of thing!
 Oww! I’m an injured man! Treat me with a little more care!
 Oh yeah, that’s right!
 All I was thinking about at that time was protecting someone I cared about…
 What I’m capable of doing right now…
 I was thinking…
 What?
 There are many variables such as mission level,
 or platoon’s member structure…
 But no matter how small a platoon might be,
 I think it’s important to assign one Medical Ninja to it…
 I know that already…
 I wrote exactly the same thing in a report long ago
 regarding the survival rate and mission achievement rate of small platoons.
 But it’s not that easy to nurture Medical Ninja.
 They require a different set of skills than that of fighting types Ninja…
 The minute perfection of Chakra control,
 the ability to assimilate a huge volume of specialized knowledge,
 the brains to apply that in a broad way… patience…
 And there is the most important thing
 for Shinobi who are to develop into a Medical Ninja…
 Well, I’m busy right now, so…
 The most important thing…huh?
 Hidden Leaf Hospital 		 I’m all wrapped up in bandages again…
 This way I can’t even hold chopsticks…
 Sakura, when it’s time for my meal, feed me, okay?
 I’ll open up my mouth just like this and…
 Huh? Sakura?
 I’m sorry! I was just joking!
 I’m sorry… Naruto…
 Huh?
 This is gonna mean that I’ll keep you waiting a little but…
 Next time, I definitely won’t…
 be a ball-and-chain to you!
 Huh?
 Enter!
 I came here with a request!
 What is it?
 Please make me your apprentice!
 You’re very desperate, aren’t you?
 Sakura Haruno,
 I heard from Kakashi that you have a brilliant mind as well as will power!
 All right.
 But in exchange, I’m not gonna be easy on you!
 Yes, ma’am!
 This recent mission…
 looks like it wasn’t wasted on her, after all.
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 He makes me so angry, that Pervy Sage!
 Didn’t he say “I’ll make you my disciple and hone your skills”?!
 When Sakura’s already become the Old Lady Tsunade's
 and is working so hard!
 And he just leaves me to my own devices! Hey!
 All because he was assigned a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!
 If things come to this,
 I’m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade a piece of my mind!

124,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Is this the first time you have faced a friend's death?
 This is the way of the Shinobi…
 I won't forgive you…
 I'm going to kill you!
 White Past: Hidden Ambition
 There's murder in his eyes!
 He looks nothing like he used to!
 He's coming!
 What?
 His Chakra repelled my attack!
 Then…
 This should do it!
 Why?!
 It can't be!
 Could... Naruto's seal have been broken…?!
 No.
 This feeling…
 True, the seal is almost off
 and the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit is escaping, but…
 Fortunately, the seal is not completely broken!
 I still have some time!
 Do you hear me, Zabuza?
 We're both busy people.
 I know it's against your style,
 but I think it's about time we stopped playing around.
 Why don't we settle this once and for all with the next move?
 Interesting.
 What can you possibly do in this situation?
 Kakashi, go ahead. 					Show me.
 No good…
 I can't hold his aura down!
 Zabuza…
 I can't defeat this boy.
 Zabuza…
 I'm…
 You…from that time…
 Why?
 Why stop?
 Even though I killed your dear friend, you can't kill me?
 Damn it!
 What happened to the force from moment ago?
 You can't defeat me with that kind of strength.
 Wasn't he someone special to you?
 Is there someone special in your life?
 I want to protect someone special to me.
 I want to make that person's dream a reality…
 That's my dream.
 Many people misunderstand.
 They pity and don't finish off the enemy they ought to finish.
 They let them survive.
 To me, that isn't compassion or anything.
 Do you know?
 How it feels to not be needed by anyone?
 To live day to day without a dream. The pain of it all.
 What are you saying?
 Zabuza has no use for a weak Shinobi.
 You took away my reason for existence.
 Why?
 Why do you have to serve a guy like that?
 He gets the money from thugs to do bad things!
 Is that No-Brow the only person special to you?
 A long time ago, I had other people special to me.
 They were…my parents.
 I was born in the Land of Water, in a small village heavy with snow.
 My parents worked on a small farm.
 We were very poor,
 but my parents seem to be satisfied with it.
 I was happy then…
 They were loving parents.
 But…
 When I was old enough to understand things,
 something happened.
 Something?
 What happened?
 My blood…
 Blood?
 Go on!
 Tell me what happened.
 My father… He killed my mother.
 Then he tried to kill me.
 Huh?!
 After the experience of the ceaseless civil war,
 people with Kekkei Genkai were hated and feared in the Land of Water.
 Kekkei Genkai?
 It's special powers or Jutsu passed on through certain clans,
 from parent to child, or from grandparent to grandchild.
 Because of their special powers,
 those of the clans were exploited in all sorts of battles.
 As a result, all Kekkei Genkai were feared
 as harbingers of disaster and death.
 After the war was over,
 they decided to hide their special powers.
 If anyone knew of their secret, only death could be expected.
 I'm sure that boy went through so much suffering as well.
 The greater your power, the more you were feared.
 My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.
 She kept it secret from my father.
 She hoped that for a while…
 No, she must have thought that they could have a simple life forever.
 Look, Mommy! Look!
 Isn't it fantastic?
 Not you, too!
 Why? Why him, too?
 That hurts, Mommy!
 Sorry…
 I'm sorry, Haku…
 I'm sorry!
 However…
 Father had discovered our secret.
 When I came to…
 I had killed my own father.
 And that moment, what I thought of myself was that…
 no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 The most…painful thing…?
 That I…
 that my existence didn't matter to anyone else in the world.
 Same with me.
 You told me that...
 You'll be the best Ninja in the village, and make everyone respect you.
 If someone comes along and accepts you for who you are,
 no one could be more important to you than that person.
 Even though he knew I was from a clan with Kekkei Genkai,
 Zabuza took me in.
 My power that everyone hated... He wanted it, needed it.
 Brats like you won't be needed by anyone and die like dogs.
 You have the same eyes as I do…
 Brat…
 Do you want… to be needed by someone?
 Are you willing to give everything for me?
 From now on, your power belongs to me.
 Come with me.
 I was so happy…
 Haku, bad news.
 I have to leave the Land of Water as of tonight.
 However, I'll be back in this land some day.
 I will rule over this land.
 To do that...
 what I need isn't consolation, encouragement or empty words.
 What I really need is…
 I already know.
 You have nothing to fear.
 I am your weapon, Zabuza.
 Keep me by you as a mere tool that heeds your every word.
 You're a good boy!
 I apologize, Zabuza.
 I wasn't good enough to be the tool you were looking for.
 Naruto!
 I want you…
 to kill me.
 Ninja Art, Summoning, Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
 Whatever you do won't work!
 You have absolutely no idea where I am now.
 However…
 I know exactly where you are and what you're about.
 Kakashi…
 You are completely in my hands now.
 W-What is that racket?
 What... Just what's going on out there?
 If you can't use your eyes or ears, simply use your nose.
 That's what happens
 when you're closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
 This is the Summoning Jutsu specialized for pursuit.
 I deliberately shed my own blood
 to stop your attacks both times for this.
 Your weapons have a thick scent of my blood on them now.
 Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.
 And their sense of smell is without equal.
 You're the one who was playing into my hands.
 The fog has lifted already.
 And your future is… 					death.
 I've had enough of your bluffs!
 Don't act tough!
 There's nothing you can do in this situation.
 Your death is certain.
 Zabuza.
 You were too full of yourself.
 You're too ambitious for your own good.
 You assassinated the Mizukage, but failed to pull off a coup.
 You left the service with few men under you,
 and became a Rogue Ninja.
 Soon after, your name reached our Hidden Leaf Village.
 You needed to raise funds to strike back.
 And you needed to hide from
 the Tracking Unit's pursuit and retaliation.
 Isn't that about the reason
 why you hired yourself out to scum like Gato?
 Zabuza.
 Do you really believe I've managed to survive with just Sharingan?
 Here's something I didn't copy, a Jutsu of my own…
 To enlighten you!
 Lightning Blade!
 What the…?!
 His hand is visibly overflowing with Chakra!
 You are too dangerous.
 Tazuna, the man you are trying to assassinate
 is the symbol of courage in this land!
 The bridge he is building is the hope of this land!
 And your ambitions will sacrifice countless lives.
 That isn't how a Shinobi is supposed to behave.
 Who cares?
 I have always fought for my own ideals.
 And that will never ever change!
 I'll say it again.
 Huh?
 Give up.
 Your future is… 					death!
 Please kill me.
 What are you hesitating for?
 No…
 What you said is ridiculous!
 You're a weapon? Just a tool for him?
 How can you call him special to you?
 Are you really okay with that?
 Is that wrong?
 Huh?
 Tell me, what is wrong with that?
 Well, uh…
 It's not…
 Zabuza counts on me, even if I'm worthless.
 He made me feel needed.
 But now, I've lost my usefulness that affirmed my existence.
 Zabuza no longer needs me.
 That's why, I am now appealing to you.
 Please, make it quick
 W-Why did this happen?
 Is this what it means to be a strong Ninja?
 To protect someone?
 Are you okay with that?
 Are you really okay with that?
 I don't get it. I can never accept that!

 Kurenai's Top-Secret Mission: The Promise with the Third Hokage
 The two who went in first haven’t come back, huh?
 Sure enough, is Yakumo in a state of awakening?
 You two handle Yakumo and Kurenai…
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 You handle the nuisance that’s heading this way.
 Yes, sir!
 What?!
 Leave it to me…
 That emblem…!
 You’re with the Kurama Clan…?!
 Yuhi Kurenai… Hand over Yakumo quietly.
 What does the Kurama Clan plan to do with Yakumo?!
 This is a clan issue.
 It doesn’t concern you.
 Yakumo is the child I’ve taken custody of,
 from the Third Hokage.
 Then, by force…
 No!
 You can’t escape now!
 What’s this?!
 To think she’d make it look like she got caught in a Genjutsu
 and then trap us in a Genjutsu…!
 Damn it! Where’d she go…?
 It hurts…
 You okay…?!
 Wha--?!
 You jerk!
 Oh, Naruto!
 – Hey! Hold it. 					– H-Hey!
 Take this!
 What?!
 Ow-ow… Hm?!
 This bean stalk is too damn big!
 I-I can’t move…!
 This is not good!
 Naruto!
 Die!
 Shino!
 What?!
 Genjutsu doesn’t work on the insects…
 Damn it.
 Wh-What…?!
 He vanished?!
 There!
 No matter where you hide, you can’t cover up your scent!
 Man-Beast Clone!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Yes!
 Severe Leaf Hurricane!
 No chance a half-baked Genjutsu would work on us fully trained Ninja!
 Stop!
 – Huh? – Let go, let go! Let me go!
 Jeez!
 – Naruto! 					– Let go!
 Release!
 What?! Sakura…
 Morning…
 It’s because you charge right into an enemy’s Jutsu on your own.
 Oh! Kurenai Sensei and Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Who’re these people?!
 All four of them have been caught in a Genjutsu and are unconscious.
 Kurenai Sensei!
 S-Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 She’s nowhere to be found!
 Byakugan!
 What is it?!
 K-Kurenai Sensei has…
 There's one left…
 Just like that… To think they’d cast a Genjutsu on me.
 Release!
 What?! It won’t wear off?!
 It’s Unkai who served as the replacement leader
 of the Kurama Clan after my father died.
 Unkai from the Kurama Clan… I see.
 Things won’t go as they did with the others, eh?
 Kurenai Yuhi, Genjutsu user.
 I’m embarrassed to be praised by you…
 I’d like to avoid needless battle.
 Hand over Yakumo.
 Hang on tight.
 You may very well be Kurenai Yuhi,
 but how do you intent to fight within my Jutsu?!
 Oh, no!
 Damn you!
 I smell blood!
 Heh. I won’t let you escape…
 There!
 Next, I’ll pierce your heart…
 Hand over Yakumo. Why do you protect her?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 I won’t let you touch Kurenai Sensei!
 Look out!
 Wha--?! Not again!
 Geez, when will you ever learn, Naruto?!
 Byakugan!
 Naruto! The enemy’s above you!
 Huh?!
 Byakugan, huh?!
 If you’re coming at me with Genjutsu, then…
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Go!
 Clones, huh?!
 Heh! Mine aren’t just illusions.
 Let’s go!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 U-zu-ma-ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 I’ll definitely get Yakumo…
 Byakugan!
 Yakumo has been sedated to calm her nerves and is asleep now.
 But it would be best for her
 to have a complete examination back at the village hospital.
 It was a big help having you here, Sakura.
 You should also get some first-aid treatment, Sensei.
 Right… Thanks.
 Okay, please show me.
 They’ve been like this the whole time.
 It doesn’t look like they’ll wake up from the Genjutsu
 for quite a while…
 Well, I guess that serves our interests better. Hm?
 It’s…!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Oh! Thank goodness you look okay!
 Y-Yes…
 She’s not okay!
 Wha--?!
 I gave her some first-aid treatment, but she has a deep wound.
 We must get back to the village quickly…
 Don’t worry about me.
 I’m more concerned about Yakumo’s instability.
 Yeah, their comrades could very well return.
 I’m also concerned about
 how we haven’t seen the three people who were assigned to guard Yakumo.
 All right!
 Leave this to me and all of you head back to the village
 with Kurenai and Yakumo!
 Organize a back-up unit.
 Your opponents are practitioners of Genjutsu.
 Will you be okay alone?
 What?
 This fully…
 …trained body!
 I would cram by the likes of the Kurama Clan’s Genjutsu!
 A pun?
 Oh?
 Are you awake?
 Hey, do you resent Kurenai Sensei for sealing your Genjutsu?!
 That person hates me…
 She didn’t want to make me into a practitioner of Genjutsu.
 It’s not like that!
 Then…why?!
 I’m sure she had some kind of reason!
 You would’ve been in trouble had Kurenai Sensei
 not risked her life to save you before!
 That was the Kurama Clan… People from the same clan as me.
 What?
 Why would people from the same clan as you…?
 Kiba, could you take Kurenai Sensei back to the village?
 I’m fine… I can at least do that myself.
 Kiba?!
 Hey, Kurenai Sensei?!
 Tell us the truth!
 Isn’t this incident and you quitting our squad…
 somehow related?
 The Kurama Clan into which Yakumo was born…
 was once a force in the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as a family of Genjutsu users.
 However, they had been brought to ruin in recent years,
 unable to turn out Chunin and Jonin.
 Then a rising star brimming with talent appeared in the clan.
 And that was Yakumo.
 My parents and relatives placed their hopes in me,
 the only daughter of the head family.
 But I was in poor health and my official entrance into the Academy
 was not acknowledged.
 I had wanted to live up to the expectations
 of my parents and the clan…
 and I got really depressed.
 My father saw me like that
 and negotiated directly with the Third Hokage for me.
 The Third Hokage whom Murakumo consulted
 realized the high level of Yakumo’s latent power
 and decided to leave her in my custody.
 By the order of the Third Hokage,
 Kurenai Sensei became my personal teacher.
 But…
 Y-Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei… She…!
 Why?!
 I don't know.
 Maybe since I’m a Genjutsu user too,
 I got jealous of the high level of Yakumo’s latent powers.
 Jealous…?!
 Genjutsu practitioners with higher powers than mine
 are not necessary in this village.
 No way. You’d do that for a reason like that…?
 You understand, don’t you?
 A selfish person like me can’t continue to go on missions
 with your lives entrusted to me.
 I can’t believe that!
 It’s not just her… I’m a hindrance to the Leaf Village.
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I just can’t believe it.
 Isn’t Kurenai Sensei still hiding something from us…?
 I also…get that feeling.
 Exactly.
 It’s because…
 Kurenai Sensei’s hand shook with heartache
 when she talked about events in the past.
 But the shaking stopped… when she talked about her motive.
 What do you mean?
 That motive is a lie.
 The heart is not affected by a made-up story.
 Then her being jealous of Yakumo…
 Perhaps she’s protecting someone.
 Someone so important Kurenai Sensei would protect?
 That would be, for example…
 I overheard Kurenai Sensei and the Third Hokage talking.
 Yakumo’s powers probably will not awaken for a long while.
 I see. But the time will eventually come
 when the dam bursts and her powers will pour out.
 That power of the Kurama Clan will eventually threaten
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 At that time, we’ll have to eliminate it.
 Even the Third Hokage was involved with the sealing of my powers.
 The Third Hokage would never order something like that!
 My parents died just before
 I started training under Kurenai Sensei.
 There was a sudden fire.
 It seems the fire spread quickly and they couldn’t be saved…
 But my parents were even Jonin!
 To think they would die just in a fire.
 And a fire in broad daylight on top of that…
 And after that, although I was told there was no foul play…
 the autopsy reports were classified and sealed.
 No way?! lt wasn’t just an ordinary fire?
 My parents were killed on order of the Third Hokage…!
 No way…! No way could that ever be true!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 The story I heard from the girl.
 The story I heard from Kurenai Sensei.
 Which one is true? lt’s unlikely that they’re all lying.
 But I can say this.
 There’s no way the Third Hokage would think about eliminating the girl.
 For the time being,
 I’ve got to get Sensei and the others to the hospital quick--!
 What’s this?!
 Next time: “Genjutsu or Reality?”

126,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Mess up the village…you say?!
 I won’t let you do that no matter what!
 I mean, there’s no way just the four of you can do that!
 But, we can…
 A person who knows village matters very well gave us information
 on where and how to attack.
 Knows village matters very well…
 It couldn’t be!
 You mean Orochimaru?!
 Who knows…?
 Well, that’s how it is, so we can’t have you guys living.
 Umm, can you see this?
 Paper Bombs!
 We’re going to detonate the Paper Bombs
 after we’ve left here…
 There’s nowhere to run…
 There’s no chance of someone coming to save you.
 Prepare yourselves.
 It’s better than going back to the Academy, isn’t it?
 Umm, rest in peace.
 H-Hey! Just a minute!
 Farewell, real me.
 Run, Dodge, Zigzag! Chase or be Chased!
 It should’ve just been hunting for treasure,
 but to think this would happen…
 Sure enough, nothing good comes
 of being together with you on missions, Naruto!
 This isn’t the time to be saying stuff like that!
 They’re attempting to mess up the Leaf Village by impersonating us!
 Then how’re we going to get out of here?!
 Well…
 If I use the Rasengan, I could somehow…
 They’d notice that!
 It’d be the end if we were to get ambushed outside.
 Then, with your Fang Over Fang…
 That’d be the same, the same!
 You moron!
 Then what should we do?!
 – Umm… 					– Huh?
 If I use my Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms…
 I get it!
 With that we can weather this crisis without the guys outside noticing!
 If I could just loosen these ropes a little…
 Leave that to me!
 N-Naruto?!
 All right!
 Me, too!
 Kiba…
 Akamaru…
 Just a little more…
 It snapped…
 Protective 8 Trigrams…
 64 Palms!
 Now then, shall we go as arranged?
 – Kiba! 					– Yeah!
 – Hinata! 					– Yes!
 Naruto!
 I know!
 Hinata!
 You okay?
 Oh…!
 What…?
 Hey, Hinata! Cut our ropes before you faint.
 Right.
 It seems the guys outside are gone.
 It doesn’t look like this place is going to hold up now.
 It looks like it’d be best for us to escape as soon as we can.
 What’s that?!
 It’s the buried treasure chest.
 Leave it be!
 It’s a fake anyway.
 And there might be some kind of trap set.
 But it’s our mission to take this back with us, so…
 There really might be buried treasure in it, right?!
 Byakugan!
 It looks empty inside… Wait, there’s paper inside.
 Isn’t it a Paper Bomb?
 It doesn’t seem to be anything dangerous…
 Then I guess I’ll take it for now.
 Come on, there’s no need to go to the trouble of…
 But it might make for a good mark to distinguish him from the imposter…
 I get it.
 Akamaru, you’re the mark for the real me, so stay close to me.
 There’s no time.
 I’ll be going with our Fang Over Fang. Make sure you keep up!
 R-Right.
 Man-Beast Clone…
 Fang Over Fang!
 You okay, Hinata?
 I’m fine… I just have to follow after Kiba, so…I’ll be o…
 Hinata!
 All right!
 You okay, Hinata?
 Naruto!
 Does your leg hurt?
 Kiba…
 If your leg hurts, say so first.
 I was thinking I must not cause trouble, so…
 Actually, that is trouble.
 I’m sorry…
 Surprisingly, this might be the weakness of our team.
 Huh…?
 Hinata shows too much concern for us.
 Naruto and I speak too bluntly to each other and we get into fights…
 N-Now that you mention it…
 If we’d take on our missions while being a little conscious of stuff like that,
 we might… become a pretty good team.
 Got it!
 I’ll try…
 All right. Then Naruto and I will go after those guys.
 Hinata, you come later. Your leg’s hurt, so don’t force things…
 Got it.
 Listen up. You’re hurt, Hinata. So you follow later.
 I just said that, didn’t I?
 Huh? Did you?
 Right…Thanks…
 Let’s go, Naruto!
 I have to hurry, too…
 I’m back!
 You’re back, Naruto?
 We couldn’t catch up with them, huh…?
 Naruto? Kiba?!
 Was I here just now?!
 Y-Yeah.
 That one was an imposter!
 Say what?!
 But the dog didn’t notice anything…
 He can’t be sniffed out even with the nose of a Ninja Hound!
 Akamaru was fooled, too!
 We’ve got trouble! To the Hokage, immediately.
 Right!
 Akamaru! You remember the smell of that Agari old man, right?!
 After him!
 Lady Tsunade!
 We’ve just received a communication…!
 Nobody realizes it.
 Stay sharp. Our mission isn’t over yet, so.
 That’s right. The crucial part comes now.
 Someone’s coming!
 We found you, imposters!
 We’ll kick your butts!
 Oh-ho… So you’re alive…
 Naturally!
 This time it’s your turn to prepare yourselves…
 After all, this is our home field.
 There are times when you lose
 even when fighting on your home field!
 We won’t let you get away!
 H-Hinata?!
 I’m going to inform the Hokage!
 Naruto, you go after the imposters!
 Got  …it.
 Hey…
 Upon careful thought, the real Hinata hasn’t come yet…!
 You imposter!
 What the…?!
 What’re you doing to Hinata?!
 It’s just like I’m the imposter.
 Naruto!
 What’re you doing?!
 W-Well…
 He’s an imposter!
 What?!
 Prepare yourself, imposter!
 Hey! Wait a minute…!
 Hey, you’re also an imposter!
 Even if you can copy the appearance and scent,
 you can’t go so far as copy Ninjutsu, right?!
 Let’s go, Akamaru.
 Fang Over…?
 Knocked out…?
 No way. It was just a punch, and I didn’t even use a Jutsu…
 Come to think of it…
 I was slugged good and hard, but I didn’t feel it at all.
 Hey! Weren’t you going to mess up the village?!
 You guys are utterly weak!
 Damn it!
 I’ll catch the fake Hinata, so you handle yourself somehow!
 Leave me to me!
 Hold it!
 Hold it!
 I wonder if I got overly ambitious and borrowed too many books…
 Hey, Naruto!
 You…
 You moron!
 You’re butt is so heavy you fell right on it!
 Ugly! Ugly!
 Forehead girl!
 I’ll kick your butt the next time I see you!
 I’ll kick your butt, no matter what!
 Sakura, get out of the way!
 Naruto.
 I’ll kick your butt!
 Wh-Why?!
 What?
 Why’s the Naruto who ran that way coming from over here?
 I’m off on a delivery.
 Right. Take care.
 What is it?! You okay, Ayame?!
 Y-Yeah. Naruto suddenly flew in…
 What…?
 Na-ru-to!
 How dare you do that to my daughter…?!
 Wh-What…?
 I’m okay, Dad.
 No, you rest a bit.
 I will have Naruto take the responsibility and make the delivery!
 What?!
 But, but I…
 If you refuse,
 I’ll never let you eat my ramen ever again!
 This isn’t the time for me to be making a delivery!
 I finished the delivery!
 Okay! Good work!
 Where did he go?!
 My…imposter!
 This jerk was also weak…
 Kiba… Stop… 					Forgive me…
 That might’ve worked on Naruto. But I hate soppy stuff…
 like that!
 Did these guys seriously intend to attack the village…?
 Where are you, imposter?!
 Come out!
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Could it be that I came here?
 Yeah, you did.
 You’ll be paying me for what you ate earlier.
 That jerk…!
 Forty-five plates…
 Here.
 Eating and running with someone else’s face…
 That imposter…
 He’s not messing up the village, he’s messing up my reputation.
 Hey…
 No way…!
 My Golden Delicious Ninja Way Ramen Pure Heart of Fire
 I’d been setting aside!
 I won’t allow it…!
 No matter what, I won’t allow it…!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Go! 					– Go!
 – Where is he?! – Where’s the imposter?!
 – Where are you?! – Imposter!
 Where are you?! Come out!
 I’ll kill you, imposter!
 I’ll pay the bill later!
 – Find him! 					– Where is he?!
 There he is!
 Hey!
 – I won’t let you get away! – Got you!
 – I’ve got you! – You're wrong!
 – Is it you?! – I’m not an imposter!
 Calm down, guys!
 The imposter isn’t carrying a chest on his back!
 – What? 					– It's not him?
 – Now that you mention it… – That's right.
 That’s right!
 Then…
 It’s him!
 Yikes!
 At the end of the day, these guys were nothing special.
 Hey, are these guys really Orochimaru’s henchmen?
 Who knows?
 The Hokage will look into the details for us.
 That’s right.
 Man, I’m tired.
 My shoulders got stiff from carrying this thing around the whole time.
 Naruto! Kiba!
 Oh, the real Hinata’s come back.
 Hey, Hinata! Over here!
 Naruto!
 He’s not carrying the chest on his back… Then this Naruto…
 He’s the imposter!
 Gentle Fist!
 Oh, boy. I feel bad for that Naruto…
 – What?! 					– What?!
 A test?!
 This mission was a test
 in order to see the teamwork of you three.
 A Shinobi will often have to form teams with various others
 in response to the qualities and conditions of the mission.
 At such times,
 failing if teamed with a certain other person is a problem.
 And so I gave you a mission that was easy at the start.
 And I made it so along the way…
 something would happen involving a village crisis.
 At that time,
 I wanted to see whether you could handle it as a team.
 So that’s what it was…
 That’s harsh!
 We would’ve died if we’d made the slightest mistake.
 It’s okay. I got the story about you guys from Lady Tsunade.
 It was set up so even if you were to make a mistake,
 you would only be injured.
 Since this time around you had the Ninja HoundDog Akamaru,
 I enlisted the help of the Kedouin Clan…
 so you wouldn’t be able to distinguish the enemy.
 And?
 How did these three do?
 Let me see…
 They floundered part of the way and I was worried about the outcome…
 But I shall pass them.
 In terms of results, they did capture us, so…
 Oh yeah.
 That’s…!
 It was more or less our mission to bring this, so.
 With this, our mission is complete.
 There’s no point in going to the trouble of bringing…
 No, no.
 There is something important inside that I must give to you, Lady Hokage.
 Farewell, Naruto. Take it easy.
 You, too.
 See ya.
 Yeah.
 Are they going to look like that forever?
 It seems they’ll get their own faces back naturally in a few days.
 I see…
 Wh-What’s this…?!
 A bill for the recent training…?!
 Here…he said he’d be glad to cooperate…
 It comes to this much?
 This is a hard world to live in, isn’t it?
 My name is Tsunade…
 My concern now is a debt that absolutely will not go down.
 More like, it’s growing, isn’t it?
 I shouldn’t have become… the likes of Hokage…!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 No, it’s gone, gone, gone! Where’d you put it, Naruto?
 Oh, if you mean that, I wrote it.
 You wrote it?
 And I gave it to a Delivery Ninja.
 You gave it?
 So it should reach the other party today.
 You idiot! At this rate, my life as a writer will…
 More importantly, let’s get the training started.
 Shut up and come with me, Naruto!
 We have to get that back at any cost!

 No way… What happened to Iruka Sensei?
 Iruka’s scent ends right here…
 In any case, all we can do is search for him.
 Damn it. Where’s Iruka Sensei?!
 Iruka Sensei!
 What a relief!
 You’re safe!
 Somehow…
 Damn…that Mizuki…
 Iruka Sensei…
 That injury…
 Huh, this injury is nothing…
 Iruka Sensei!
 I’m all right… I just had a little rush of pain…
 Somebody’s approaching!
 What a relief the wound’s not deep.
 Yes…
 The atmosphere feels kind of heavy…
 Hmm…There must be something between those two…
 Well, what I think is…
 What’s up with the paw pad?
 Idiot! Look carefully! The little finger, the little finger!
 Little finger? Huh?! lruka Sensei’s?
 Well, my intuition tells me that it’s positive…
 Naruto, what are you two talking about?
 Uh, nothing!
 Huh? Let me make an introduction.
 This is Tsubaki… Mizuki’s fiancée.
 Fiancée? Mizuki’s…?
 Ah, it’s negative…
 What’s up with that reaction?!
 Mizuki has caused problems for you again…
 I sincerely apologize for that.
 So you know about Mizuki’s prison break…?
 Yes…
 He came by my house once…
 I became aware of that immediately and tried to stop him.
 But ultimately the result was that I allowed him to go…
 It really couldn’t be helped in light of the situation…
 No. I should have tried even harder to stop him.
 But I…
 Iruka, Naruto, I beg you!
 Please take me with you!
 Tsubaki…
 I understand that I’m making an impossible request!
 But I want to stop him, no matter what!
 Iruka Sensei!
 Tsubaki, I understand how you feel.
 In that case…
 I’m sorry, but I cannot allow that.
 But why…?
 Why can’t she?!
 Naruto, we must hurry up and search for Mizuki!
 If she’s with us, she’ll interfere with our mission!
 But… But…!
 Iruka… If that’s the case, I think I'll be of service to you.
 I have an idea of where he might be heading!
 Is that true, Tsubaki?!
 There’s probably no mistake…
 But…
 I beg you!
 I think it’s certain
 that he’ll use various tricks to camouflage his tracks as he flees…
 If we spend time on that… it will all be too late!
 Please take me with you!
 Regarding the matter of Nara No. 23…
 Huh, what was the result?
 The Ninja Herb: Creeping Saxifrage…
 Huh?! Who are you!
 Dragon, Rooster, Dog…
 The lookouts have been taken down!
 It’s an intruder!
 What?!
 The Nara Clan’s research lab was attacked?!
 Yes… I just received a dispatch from the Nara Clan…
 According to the dispatch,
 the insurgent’s physical characteristics match those of Mizuki.
 Mizuki’s…?
 Yes!
 What is that Naruto doing?
 But it’s something to have come up with the idea of the Nara Clan’s institute…
 Notwithstanding the abundance of narcotic substances that are stored there,
 due to its remote mountain location, security is comparatively lax.
 And what substances were stolen?
 Well… Because of their thorough control of the substances,
 they were able to determine immediately which substances were taken…
 So the description matched after all, huh…
 But even if a mere Chunin were to remove those narcotic substances
 what would he be able to do with them?
 Oh… Thank you. You may go now…
 Yes ma’am!
 In any case, I can’t take any chances…
 There’s nothing I can do if I don’t know what his objective is.
 If I can’t discern that from the actual materials…
 there may still be some means…
 Perhaps the proportions of the formula,
 or possibly the order in which they’re blended…
 There’s no mistake that it’s this direction, right?
 Yes… Please continue to proceed just like this.
 Tsubaki, you said “It will all be too late.”
 But do you know what his objective is?
 Probably… Although maybe not totally.
 Tsubaki, please tell us!
 In the past, he told me…
 ""I will get my hands on Orochimaru’s power and go to where Orochimaru is.""
 What was that?!
 The reason he stole the Scroll of Sealing
 was simply because he had chosen it as a hospitality gift…
 Tsubaki… You knew that?
 I didn’t convey it to the village…
 Just removing the Scroll of Sealing is a serious felony…
 And moreover, I was scared for what’d happen
 if his real objective had come to light…
 I believed that he would mend his ways.
 In that case you cannot avoid retribution either.
 I am prepared for it.
 I thought it was strange…
 If you knew where Mizuki was going,
 you should have pursued him alone in the first place.
 But you…
 I may not be able to stop him alone…
 I want to stop him at any cost…
 I don’t want him to commit any more crimes.
 Unbelievable!
 That Orochimaru… So this was his plan!
 However, could an ordinary Ninja really manage to do this…?
 It’s something only within
 the realm of an experienced artisan’s technique…
 I’m busy!
 I have a progress report on the inmate prison break incident!
 All right… Enter!
 Yes, ma’am!
 We have just finished recapturing all inmates
 with the exception of three – Mizuki, Fujin and Raijin.
 Good work…
 We are now continuing to investigate the other three…
 But, the last inmate we captured said something that concerned me…
 Something that concerned you?
 Yes… He apparently saw the three of them fleeing together…
 Fujin and Raijin were fleeing with Mizuki?!
 Damn it!
 Lady Tsunade…?
 I’m going out!
 Where are you going?
 There’s no need for you to come…
 If what he said is true,
 the guys I sent out won’t be able to deal with the situation alone…
 Hey, Shikamaru… lf things continue like this…
 we’ll be in trouble!
 We’re already in trouble…
 Shikamaru… All the Chakra is…
 I know that…
 I’ve thought of several methods,
 but if I let go of these guys we are gonna find ourselves in trouble…
 You insolent jerk!
 Having said that,
 I can’t take them down simply by catching them,
 so that’s why I’m doing this…
 I won’t let you leave here alive!
 These guys have monstrous stamina…
 And what’s more,
 although their bodies look like rubber at first glance,
 with that much muscle strength their instantaneous reflexes
 are probably quite something too…
 In other words,
 you’re saying that this is the only possible method…
 Let’s do our best, everyone!
 Sorry about this…
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 It’s no good… lt’s unfortunate but, he can no longer…
 I see… All right! Let’s withdraw!
 Hurry up!
 Yeah…
 It’s unfortunate but…
 guys who are of no use on the battleground
 only become a ball and chain…
 Even though it’s just a minor injury,
 you won’t be able to move from this place, can you?
 Who’s that?!
 Oh no! Is it Genjutsu Paralysis?!
 I saw that…
 No way… This can’t be, you’re…
 Orochimaru?!
 You are correct…
 This can’t be… Why are you here?
 Your whereabouts are supposed to be unknown!
 It doesn’t matter why…
 More importantly,
 I witnessed something very interesting earlier on…
 You took the life of an injured comrade, didn’t you?
 You saw that…?
 That piqued my interest…
 That’s not a sight one sees very often among the Leaf Shinobi
 who devote their entire time to playing house in the village…
 So what are you trying to say?!
 I didn’t do anything wrong! I had no choice but to do what I did!
 You’re a short-tempered child, aren’t you…?
 I’m not reproaching you. You were just carrying out your mission.
 That’s right…
 But… Is there anybody in the Leaf Village who acknowledges you?
 What did you just do?!
 What in the world is this…?
 This is my present to you…
 Go visit that place if you feel like it.
 Here it is…
 Looks like there hasn’t been a trespasser here before me…
 The eighth one on the right…
 What’s happening?
 What is that power of Orochimaru’s anyway?
 I don’t know either.
 And I don’t know when he encountered Orochimaru either…
 But I’m positive that the answer to those questions is waiting just up ahead!
 That Scroll of Sealing incident…
 You must be angry about it, aren’t you, Naruto?
 I don’t care about that in the least anymore…
 Because I repaid my debt to that jerk Mizuki right there and then.
 But…
 But?
 If that guy is still connected to Orochimaru,
 I need to ask him about something!
 Because there’s someone I need to find at any cost!
 Sasuke…!
 It’s up there…
 All right!
 That’s everything…
 With this all…
 This will …
 This will make me perfect!
 This place is…
 That guy has done something…
 That smell gives me the shivers…
 Smell?
 I was wondering who that was…
 You guys are really persistent, aren’t you?
 Well, this is very convenient.
 Because I was intending to take you guys down anyway.
 Mizuki…
 You jerk!
 Mizuki… Your ambitions end here!
 Impudent as always, huh… However, you’re too late!
 Just like you always are…
 What is that?
 Beautiful, don’t you think?
 Damn it!
 You guys…should feel honored to be my first prey…
 What?!
 That’s…almost like…
 But that’s they way it is, isn’t it, Naruto…?
 It’s true, you were actually special.
 But…
 Then that’s…
 Orochimaru’s power!
 Mizuki…
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 That’s what you meant by the “invincible body”?
 No matter how much strength you gain,
 the kind of strength dependant on drugs can never be a true strength!
 Hah! Just like Iruka Sensei says! Orochimaru’s Drug?
 I’ll crush that kind of nonsense, so be prepared!

 Hey…don’t you want to see it?
 It’s about time.
 What?
 You know what I’m talking about.
 Kakashi Sensei’s…real face!
 What are you doing?!
 That’s stupid!
 I’m not interested.
 Today’s mission is over, so I’m going home…
 Yeah, I agree…
 Aw geez… It sounds like fun.
 Maybe he has…
 lips like cod roe?
 Lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,
 lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe…
 Take one more push!
 Or maybe a buckteeth?!
 Buckteeth?!
 Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?!
 Gotta See! Gotta Know! Kakashi Sensei's True Face!
 But this is rare…
 Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
 All three of you treating me…
 Snow might fall--
 – Great success! – Great success!
 You know what I mean?
 Here! Thanks for waiting!
 All three of you treating me…
 Snow might fall today?
 Or if it’s not that…
 – Great success! – Great success!
 Maybe it’s that…
 Here! Thanks for waiting!
 All three of you treating me…
 Snow might fall today?
 Or if it’s not that…
 are you guys up to something… or not?
 – Great success! – Great success!
 …like that.
 Or if it’s not that, are you guys up to something?
 Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!
 K-Kakashi Sensei, we’re celebrating your release from the hospital!
 N-Now! P-P-P-lease eat, eat!
 All right… Then I’ll eat it without hesitation.
 Thank you for waiting.
 The pork slices are our treat.
 Thanks for the treat.
 Oh! Sasuke… What a coincidence!
 Get away! Ino Pig!
 Wha--?!
 Aw man! I can’t see at all!
 I’m finished! That was good…
 – So fast! 					– So fast!
 Huh? Something wrong?
 N-Nothing’s wrong.
 Hey!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 – Wow! I'm really curious! – Wow! I'm really curious!
 Now, I will not allow myself to be denied a glimpse of him!
 But how are you going to see it?
 That’s…
 We’ll see it somehow…
 I’m asking you how! You idiot!
 Then, then, do you have a good plan, Sakura?
 That’s…
 We’ll follow by completely marking him.
 If we do that, he’ll eventually take his mask off.
 Sasuke, you are really bright.
 What’s that big deal? That was so average!
 Did you say something?
 Well, that's fine.
 What's Kakashi Sensei doing?
 I’m disappointed in him.
 He noticed us!
 Stupid Naruto! We were found because of you!
 I tell you it’s not my fault!
 What?!
 I-It’s being made into a movie?!
 I’m going to go buy an advance ticket.
 Hey, he’s begun to move!
 We’ll follow his track!
 Yeah!
 What? He's gone!
 Darn, he got away…
 Darn it, where did he go…?
 What are you guys doing?
 Do you guys have some business with me?
 – N-Not really… – N-Not really…
 Hey, how did he find us out?
 Isn’t it because there are too many of us?
 If the presence is erased, the number of people shouldn’t matter!
 Or…have you forgotten the Jutsu? Sakura…
 That’s you!
 It will be good training to shadow him.
 From now on, we’ll go about it individually.
 Y-Yeah, let’s just leave Naruto here!
 What?!
 And Junko then says… “Oh, I am losing you.”
 What? What?
 He got away…
 Clumsy as usual…
 You idiot…
 Sorry.
 Gosh, what is Kakashi Sensei doing?
 He hasn’t moved for such a long time…
 No way!
 Sasuke! How did it go?!
 No more shadowing.
 Off we go!
 Today’s mission is to help at a farm.
 The mission itself is not a big deal.
 We’re definitely going to look at it…
 – Kakashi Sensei’s real face! – Kakashi Sensei’s real face!
 What’s the matter?
 You guys seem to have lots of energy today.
 – I have lots of energy! – I'm ready to go!
 Oh, that’s excellent.
 I’ve finally found you…
 Kakashi Hatake!
 Kakashi…
 It has been a long while,
 but I will settle my long-standing grudge!
 Boss, what is your grudge?
 Fool! Have you forgotten?!
 I cannot forget.
 It happened in the spring of three years ago…
 No!
 You don’t need to be that scared.
 No!
 Our boss says he has something to talk to you about…
 Your boss?!
 I love you… Please marry me!
 – Boss is so cool! – Boss is so cool!
 No…
 There’s no need to be embarrassed.
 You can be honest and fly into my arms.
 No…
 Don’t worry. Even though I look like this,
 I have a tidy sum of money!
 I am telling you, no!
 What? You’re turning me down in these surroundings?
 When I say no, I mean no!
 I made it such a romantic setting, but why?
 I don’t like what I don’t like!
 Why don’t you stop it around there?
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Hey, the girl doesn’t like it and no matter how you look at it,
 you’re being rejected, buddy.
 Yeah, yeah.
 You're pretty gutsy.
 Do you understand who we are?!
 Are you challenging us, knowing that we are the Moya Ninja Threesome…
 fearsome enough to silence a crying child?!
 Moya Ninja? Never heard of it.
 You don’t know Moya Ninja?!
 How dare you make fools of us!
 Who the hell are you?
 It’s not worth enough to introduce, but…
 Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.
 – You’re introducing yourself! – You’re introducing yourself!
 Hey you…
 You’re going to regret it.
 For getting in the way of someone's romance!
 Romance?
 Isn’t it just an annoying, one-sided love?
 Enough!
 Men! We’re going to attack!
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 4…3…2…1…
 – Hustle! Hustle! – Hustle! Hustle!
 Please! Somebody help me!
 Hey! I can't stand heights!
 I’ll take you back to the village.
 Stop talking! Hey!
 Hey, quit sighing! What, are you just leaving us here?!
 That's how it went…
 – Don’t be so proud! – Don't be so proud!
 – You lost! 					– You lost!
 So it means revenge from three years ago!
 Boss has become stronger in the last three years,
 and he’s going to beat him up in a face-to-face match!
 That’s so dramatic!
 Fool! Who would take such risk?!
 Huh?
 If we’re going to do it,
 we’ll do it stealthily from the shadows! Stealthily.
 – D-Dirty! 					– D-Dirty!
 Welcome!
 Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
 Welcome!
 Incredible!
 Looks delicious!
 How extravagant.
 Please take your time…
 Kakashi…
 Now eat, this will be your last dinner party.
 That meal contains a tasteless and odorless medicine
 that causes uncontrollable hiccups.
 Just keep on having the ceaseless hiccups and die suffering!
 It’s a fitting end for you!
 Something wrong?
 Not one of you has even laid chopsticks on the food.
 Not really, but why don’t you, Kakashi Sensei, hurry up and eat?
 Well, I'm on a diet.
 Figured he'd say something like that.
 Then I’ll strip off that mask if it kills me!
 My hands slipped…
 How could you!
 Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally…
 – What do you mean ""unintentionally""?! – What do you mean ""unintentionally""?!
 What a pity! The meal…
 – How could he do such a thing?! – How could he do such a thing?!
 Hey, what’s the next move?
 Don’t worry. I have an idea.
 – An idea? 					– An idea?
 I see, this is pretty good thinking for Sasuke.
 A person would normally take off the mask here.
 Never mind that. Just be quiet, you idiot!
 Kakashi, you will die here!
 From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,
 coated with medicine I prepared that will make you laugh uncontrollably…
 You’ll die laughing…
 That is the fitting way for you…
 Darn…
 I wanted to see it too, but this is a hot spring…
 But I want to see!
 Kakashi Sensei! Aren’t you ready yet?
 All right, I’m coming in now.
 I do want to see it!
 Here he comes!
 Great!
 Oh, I can’t see at all!
 Thanks for waiting. I'll just soak for a little while.
 – Why is it like this?! – Why is it like this?!
 Now!
 Huh? Something wrong?
 And slowly, I sink in.
 What the--?!
 What happened? I want to know!
 What in the world is Kakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?
 Darn, I’m completely flushed… Huh?
 – Our clothes are gone! – Our clothes are gone!
 Please come again! Please come again!
 Thank you for coming!
 Please come again! Please come again!
 Crap…I’m going to definitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.
 But it was great that we brought spare clothes.
 I wonder who took them away…? Our clothes!
 All right, each of you work at your own posts.
 Now, break up.
 I can't stand it anymore…
 I have too much stress stored inside.
 I’m almost at the end of my patience as well…
 Sasuke…actually, me too…
 Then, it’s the last resort!
 – Last resort? – Last resort?
 What is this?
 Can’t you see? It’s Shinobi outfit.
 When did you get this ready?
 Well, well, never mind that, never mind that.
 What do you do with this?
 We’ll strip away the mask. Even if we have to use force!
 Darn Kakashi…
 Boss! Look at that!
 Hey, Kakashi Hatake!
 Hey, what are you guys up to?
 W-What are you talking about? We are simply Ninja.
 It is not that we want to see what is behind your mask--!
 Fool! Don’t say unnecessary things!
 That’s…!
 Boss! There’s somebody else besides you who holds a grudge on Kakashi!
 Now is the chance!
 Right! Let’s go!
 – Right! 					– Right!
 Stop right there!
 Kakashi! It’s time for you to pay for your crime!
 You shall die!
 With this medicine I prepared that will make you cry… What?!
 Oh, just when I thought how long you guys were going to sneak around…
 you finally come out.
 Ah, well, you know…
 But before that, Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!
 Why are you guys dressed like that?
 Huh?! Well, yeah, so…
 Oh no…
 We have to make up an explanation, whatever it is!
 Caught you!
 We were well aware that you three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!
 What?! Then our plot was exposed from the beginning!
 Of course! This was a trap to lure you guys out!
 We caught you off guard!
 So we were completely caught in the trap.
 Darn! We underestimated you, thinking it was kids!
 I never heard that story!
 Nice, Sakura!
 I don’t quite get what’s happening, but oh well…
 – Please forgive us! – Please forgive us!
 There’s no use talking…
 – O-Oh no! 					– S-Stop!
 It’s the same as three years ago!
 This time, we're hung by just one rope, combined with the same movement.
 By the way, who are you guys?
 – And he doesn’t even remember us! – And he doesn’t even remember us!
 Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
 Yeah?
 What is behind that mask?
 What? You wanted to see what’s behind this mask?
 Yeah!
 Then you should have said that from the beginning…
 Well, can you show us?
 I don’t mind…
 What the--?!
 Sure thing.
 All right…
 Is it like cod roe?
 Buckteeth?
 Or a tiny mouth?
 Behind this mask…
 – Behind that mask… – Behind that mask…
 There happens to be another mask!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 What--?!
 What in the world is that ?!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Begging your pardon! Begging your pardon!
 I was born and raised in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
 My given name is Naruto, and the surname is Uzumaki.
 People call me--
 ""The No. 1 Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja""!
 I'm not ""the No. 1 Hyperactive Knucklehead Ninja""!

129,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Oh!
 Sorry, sorry.
 Was that some eagle poop just now?
 Nothing there, huh?
 Well, I worked up a sweat,
 so I guess I’ll go home and take a shower.
 A Legend from the Hidden Leaf: The Onbaa!
 I worked up a good sweat today too.
 What’s the deal, Akamaru?
 He says you smell bad, Naruto.
 Are you making sure to take a bath?
 Don’t be saying rude things!
 No, you seriously stink.
 Come to think of it…
 The poop from the eagle a moment ago might…
 Sakura.
 Oh, I found a slacker who can’t get a mission!
 That’s just… I’m not that much a slacker!
 So it seems. You must’ve done some reckless training.
 It’s ripped.
 Huh? You’re right. I didn’t notice!
 It can’t be helped.
 Bring it to me later. I’ll sew it up for you.
 Really?! Really?! Really?!
 Sakura, you’re such a nice person.
 It’s the first time in my life… you’ve been this nice to me!
 H-Hey, Naruto. You’re exaggerating.
 Naruto!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Sakura?!
 You touched my breast just now, didn’t you?!
 I didn’t do anything like that!
 Then, what’re those hairy hands sticking out from your armpit?!
 What’s…that?
 Huh? Huh?!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Your back.
 Huh?
 Wh-What in the world is this?!
 It’s a huge poop!
 Idiot! That’s some kind of creature!
 Is it a caterpillar?!
 What?! Get it off.
 No, this is an animal.
 Let go!
 Give me a break.
 You guys, have you ever heard of the legend of Onbaa?
 Onbaa?
 I’ve never heard of it!
 Shizune! You don’t know?
 Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?
 That’s what I thought, but…
 Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend…
 A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa
 who lived deep in the mountains near the village…
 One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest
 saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa
 for his summer vacation independent research.
 The Pervy Sage?
 Yes…
 Are you an idiot?
 Do you seriously think there’s an Onbaa?
 Well, you’ll get yours when you see my independent research!
 Who would?
 Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn’t deal with you…
 You said it! Flat-chested girl!
 Who’s flat-chested?!
 No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!
 You wanna bet on that?
 Yeah! I’ll bet!
 Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya.
 Huh?!
 Then, I’m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!
 And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?
 When he came back three days later,
 he said he won with a force-out move…
 which most likely was a lie.
 Oh! here it is.
 Huh? What’s this?
 What lousy writing!
 You’re one to talk, Naruto.
 Let’s see… The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.
 The Onbaa is scary.
 No one is a match for it when it gets mad.
 But I beat it at wrestling.
 What’s this?
 The Onbaa’s child likes being carried piggyback.
 They grow up on the parent’s back.
 What?!
 What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but…
 So there was an Onbaa…
 Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,
 it stays piggyback on my back and won’t get off.
 What should I do?
 According to legend, the child Onbaa considers
 the first thing it sees after birth as its parent
 and clings to the back of that person.
 It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,
 until they become an adult.
 It seems until then, they never leave the parent’s back.
 Then, there’s no other way but to wait until it grows up.
 You say that, but when it grows up…
 it’ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?
 What’s up with that straightforward reaction?
 Well, it’s a legend, so it’ll probably get off eventually…
 Don’t be so irresponsible!
 H-Hang in there, Naruto…
 We’ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.
 Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!
 What is it?
 I won’t lose, you know!
 This isn’t a weight, man!
 What is it, Hinata?
 Naruto… I heard a strange rumor.
 A strange rumor…you say?
 That you…umm…had a child.
 Oh. You mean this?
 Huh?! Hinata!
 Hey! You okay?! Hinata!
 Hinata, Hinata!
 Hinata?!
 What’s the deal? You’re sure an extravagant guy…
 Oh!
 Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?
 Ichiraku Ramen
 You know, we don’t allow pets.
 The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.
 I missed dinner because of him.
 Overlook it just for today.
 But now that I look closer, he’s cute, isn’t he?
 So, what’s his name?
 He’s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.
 Onbu, huh…?
 Doesn’t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?
 Here.
 Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!
 Coming right up!
 Ever since you clung to my back,
 I’ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.
 Well, I guess it can’t be helped…
 He’s gotten big…! And so quickly…
 This is bad!
 Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission
 for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!
 Removal? Hey old lady…
 Onbu’s gotten big,
 so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?
 N-No, it’s not like that.
 I was thinking you’ve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.
 Then, what about the other members?
 No…
 Since you’ve shown such remarkable growth,
 a solo infiltration should be fine.
 Sure enough, it’s getting rid of the troublemaker!
 This is also fate… Okay now, back to work.
 Thanks, mister!
 N-Naruto, Naruto.
 Things are fun when you’re around, Onbu!
 That Grandma Tsunade.
 Don’t think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.
 I’ll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split
 and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!
 Right, Onbu?!
 Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!
 Who’re you, creep?!
 Who’re you?!
 What do you want?!
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!
 Prepare yourselves!
 – Say what?! 					– Get him!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01	02:29:44:16	02:29:45:10	Onbu!
 Even knowing it’s a clone…
 I won’t forgive those who hurt Onbu!
 Heh! How was that?!
 Die!
 Onbu! You saved me!
 Onbu… I owe you my life.
 Let’s get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!
 Onbu! No way will I believe that you’re a dangerous creature!
 We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!
 What was that?
 It’s okay…
 You’ve got me with you.
 Onbu?! No, it’s huge!
 Could it be…you’re after Onbu?
 Are you Onbu’s mom?!
 W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him!
 Onbu! Say something, will you?!
 Y-You idiot, Onbu!
 No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea!
 Onbu, it’s your mom.
 It’s not my intention!
 Damn it! I had a rough time of it.
 If you're a mother,
 then take better care of your child, really!
 It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.
 Huh? My body got light.
 Huh? Onbu? You got so big!
 Huh, wha--? What’s the matter, Onbu?!
 What’s the deal?!
 W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me! Can’t you tell?!
 We were getting along so well just a moment ago!
 Please remember me!
 It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!
 Oh, yeah! Naruto!
 Naruto! Naruto!
 Onbu, look at this!
 Remember! Remember this spiral!
 Naruto, Naruto!
 You remember my back you clung to the whole time, don’t you?
 Have I…had it?
 Onbu…
 I’m tired…
 This feels kind of good…
 It’s like I’m being carried piggyback.
 Onbu…
 Onbu!
 Live in good health with your mom.
 All right!
 My sides…are splitting!
 Onbaa is now no longer a legend.
 They’re thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.
 The stupid eagles carried them in, so.
 Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?! Tell me!
 Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.
 Don’t be so mean!
 At this rate, the village will be crushed.
 Tell me! Naruto!
 Don’t look at me.
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Shino and I have been sent to a certain village to deal with
 a dispute over a family head who passed away.
 An old woman suddenly appears on the road and says this to us.
 “Even dead men laugh in Motoyoshi Village.”
 They were mysterious words. I never imagined it at this time.
 To think I would see with my own eyes,
 a sight in this village too frightening to even talk about…
 Next: “Laughing Shino.”
 I can’t even go to the bathroom alone at night.

 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

 We’re almost at the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Is everybody here?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Big Brother Omasa, we’re missing one!
 What? Who is it?!
 It’s Idate! Morino Idate!
 Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!
 What should we do? Shall we wait?
 We have no choice…
 What the--?!
 Who is it?!
 You people are from the Wasabi Family of the Land of Tea, correct?
 Who are you!
 You should know your place.
 Hooligans like you people are no match for a Shinobi!
 Please don’t worry. I won’t take your lives.
 If you’ve learned from this,
 you should give up the race at Todoroki Great Shrine.
 Blast it!
 I have to at least deliver this letter to the Hidden Leaf Village.
 OK! Mission! Mission! I’m so eager to do it!
 But Kakashi Sensei is not here.
 Is he late as usual?
 No, Kakashi will not be coming.
 It's Old Lady Tsunade!
 Don’t call me an old lady!
 Excuse me… Lady Hokage…
 What do you mean by Kakashi Sensei will not be coming?
 As you three already know,
 most of the Jonin including Kakashi are on different missions.
 This time, the three of you will have to execute the mission by yourselves.
 This is a B-rank mission, escorting an important figure!
 Escorting an important figure…
 Of course, depending on the situation,
 the mission has the possibility of becoming an A-rank.
 And, who are we protecting?
 Don’t know…
 What do you mean “don’t know”?!
 In the neighboring nation of the Land of Tea,
 they have a Dedication Ceremony at the Todoroki Great Shrine
 once every four years.
 We’ve received a request to escort the runner
 who will be participating in the race that will be held there.
 But an assailant from the opponent’s side
 attacked the messengers before they arrived here.
 Assailant?
 Excuse me, but I still don’t quite understand the mission.
 Well, you should get the details directly from Boss Jirocho.
 Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah! The boss from that time!
 That’s it.
 Now that you three understand, depart immediately!
 Get to the Land of Tea by today. Snap to it!
 – Yes! 					– All right.
 Okay!
 Roger that!
 I’m counting on you.
 Mission! Help an Old Friend in the Land of Tea
 Hey Sakura, aren’t you hungry?
 Well, a little bit…
 Then it’s decided!
 And perfect timing! There’s a teahouse right over there!
 Hey, Naruto.
 You’re here…?
 Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.
 I had you go through all that trouble,
 but Jirocho of the Wasabi does not know when to give up.
 Is he still trying to take part in the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?
 That’s right.
 And there’s new information that they have also hired Shinobi.
 I see…
 Then next time, let’s beat them to a pulp at the race…
 Welcome!
 Ma’am, I’ll have sweet bean soup.
 Then I’ll have dumplings.
 How about you, Sasuke?
 Jelly…
 All right, please wait for a moment.
 Ninja from the Leaf…
 I’m gonna work so hard!
 Naruto, don’t take unnecessary action by yourself.
 Oh, okay.
 Having sweet bean soup when it's so nice outside.
 The Ninja profession sure is carefree!
 What did you say?
 Things must really be peaceful for the Leaf Village.
 Such a dense-looking bunch of guys…
 What?!
 Hey! I didn’t know there was such a cutie here.
 I take back that previous comment!
 Ah…pardon me.
 I'm Idate Morino.
 What’s your name, young lady?
 Don’t you talk to Sakura in such a familiar tone!
 Sakura… That’s a good name.
 Hey, even a chance meeting is due to karma from a previous life.
 Why don’t we talk about our future?
 Huh? Talk about…the future?
 I’m talking about you quitting the Ninja life and becoming my bride…
 Hey you! How dare you hit on her all of a sudden!
 Don’t be silly!
 Just joking.
 But hey, you fool!
 Idate here hates Ninja!
 If you wander around the Land of Tea anymore,
 there’ll be a price to pay!
 That’s amusing! Bring it on!
 Hey, Naruto!
 Ridiculous! We don’t have time to waste on a hooligan.
 Be quiet, Sasuke!
 I’m not going to forgive a guy who makes fun of Shinobi!
 I’m going to punish this guy…
 Huh?
 He’s gone…
 Impossible! I didn’t even notice…
 Where did that guy run away to?!
 Here, thank you for waiting.
 Dang it!
 Thank you for your patronage.
 What? Two bills?
 This is…?
 Oh, that kid who was here left, saying that you guys would pay.
 That guy! How dare he make fools of us!
 The sound of footsteps is far off… He has considerable speed!
 He made us look like idiots!
 I can’t stay quiet. We have to chase him!
 Missus, thank you very much. I’ll leave the money here.
 Thanks!
 All the customers today seem to be in such a hurry.
 He has incredible speed. He must have trained very hard.
 Who is he?
 Doesn’t matter, we’re definitely going to catch up to him!
 Stupid Ninja!
 There’s no way they can catch up to me!
 Owww!
 Darn it… Swift Runner Idate makes a mistake of a lifetime!
 Serves you right!
 You have some nerve, trying to run away from us.
 I’m so sorry!
 Huh?
 I’m sorry…
 I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss, then you guys showed up.
 So I did that…
 You kinda feel sorry after hearing his story.
 Then you should have said that from the start!
 Ow! Huh…?
 What’s this?
 Don’t touch it!
 This is mine!
 Wh-What the…?!
 On your mark.
 Get set…
 Go!
 Weights?
 Try to catch me now, you idiots!
 Hey! He escaped again!
 That guy!
 He simply doesn’t get it!
 Is he for real?
 What a speed…!
 No way! Even we can’t catch up to him…?
 That’s it. We don't have a chance of catching up.
 Dang it! He'll get it when I see him next time!
 All of you, thanks for coming.
 Begging your pardon! Begging your pardon!
 I was born and raised in the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
 I was bathed in birth water at “Ichiraku Ramen.”
 My given name is Naruto and the surname is Uzumaki.
 People call me--
 Loser!
 Loser…? Nah, not that!
 You’re funny as usual.
 Boss Jirocho, you're looking good yourself.
 Hey, Naruto!
 That's okay. A boy should be this spunky.
 The greetings seem to be done, so I’ll get to the main topic.
 The Fifth Hokage told us to get the details of this mission from you.
 Yes, in fact…
 Do you know of the Dedication Ceremony at the Todoroki Great Shrine?
 To…Todo…what?
 Well, make yourselves comfortable.
 The legend goes…
 A long time ago, in order to subdue a storm,
 Ryuko’s Jewels were dedicated to the Todoroki Great Shrine
 and the storm subsided.
 It became a customary event that happens once every four years.
 At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels, but several decades ago,
 it became a festival in which the first-place runner
 became the man of the year.
 In recent years, the festival has taken on another face.
 For ages now, in this port town of Degarashi,
 two families, the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,
 have controlled local operations and policed the town.
 It’s embarrassing,
 but conflict between the two families has never ceased and
 there have been numerous skirmishes over territorial rights.
 As the struggle intensified,
 the town residents became entangled and even got injured…
 In order to put a stop to the conflict, for the first time,
 there was talk of some kind of mediation in the presence of the lord.
 And it was agreed that the power holder of the town
 would be determined in a contest rather than through brawls.
 So that contest is…
 It is the Todoroki Great Shrine Dedication Ceremony
 that is held every four years.
 Four years ago, the Wagarashi easily won by hiring a Shinobi,
 and we have learned that they've hired a Shinobi again this year.
 In order to counteract that,
 we sent messengers to the Hidden Leaf Village with a request,
 but they were ambushed and attacked.
 I beg you guys!
 Please lend us your power.
 We cannot afford to lose this race to the Wagarashi Family!
 Leave it to me!
 And, who do you want us to escort?
 Oh, so you’ll take this job?
 Did you call for me, Boss?
 Oh, you guys know each other? Then that makes the story fast.
 That might not actually be the case…
 Boss Jirocho is an important person!
 By rights, he shouldn’t bow his head to Ninja like you!
 Even if he did bow his head, I’d flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.
 Oh yeah?!
 As if I’d go with some guy who came from who-knows-where!
 ""Some guy from who-knows-where""?!
 I am the brilliant Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki,
 who will eventually inherit the name of Hokage!
 Hah! Hokage is no big deal!
 Hah! The boss of hooligans is even less of a big deal!
 You idiot! Boss Jirocho is a very honorable person!
 The Hokage is a great Shinobi
 who puts his life on the line to protect the village!
 Boss Jirocho is a very, very, very honorable person
 who always puts his life on the line to protect the town!
 Hokage is more, more, more incredible!
 Even though it’s a tourist resort, everything seems so expensive.
 Sorry about that. lt sure is expensive, isn't it?
 Oh no, I didn’t mean…
 We actually don’t want to sell at this kind of price,
 but after the Wagarashi family came into power…
 P-Please forgive me!
 How dare you?!
 Do you know who you have to thank to do business?
 Are you actually thinking about turning against the Wagarashi Family?
 N-Not at all. But I have to get paid…
 You’re slow to understand.
 – Hey! 					– Yes, sir!
 P-Please stop!
 Huh! First of all, we’ll destroy you…
 Wh-Who are you?!
 Get out of here before you get hurt!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Please run away!
 These people are from the Wagarashi…
 It’ll be fine.
 – You punk! 					– Wise guy!
 We’ll let you go for today!
 If you’ve learned your lesson, never defy us again, kid!
 Or you’ll pay when we see you next time!
 – Y-You won’t get away with this! – Y-You won’t get away with this!
 Young man…
 Thank you very much.
 What a refreshing feeling!
 We definitely need Boss Jirocho's Wasabi Family to win the upcoming race.
 Sasuke…
 Yeah…
 Boss…
 Of all people, did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?
 Don’t sulk like that, Idate.
 I'm not sulking.
 It’s just that…
 Idate…
 I believe in you more than anybody else.
 The rest depends on you.
 Why don’t you believe in people a little?
 Idate…
 please run for this town.
 I beg you!
 Boss…
 Okay.
 Even in exchange for my life…
 Wow, I didn’t think it was going to be this big!
 But what kind of race is it?
 I’ll explain the course so a dummy like you can understand.
 The starting point is Degarashi Port.
 After the start, you head for Modoroki Shrine which is the midway point.
 This is Modoroki Shrine…?
 Yes… It seems the fastest way to get to Modoroki Shrine
 is to use a boat from here.
 Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewels from Modoroki Shrine and
 dedicate that jewel at the Todoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu Island.
 That's the only rule for the race.
 So shortcuts, obstructions, and secret maneuvers are all allowed.
 So hiring a Ninja is not a violation of the rule either.
 Who are the Ninja that the other side hired?
 They’re hiding somewhere and checking the situation.
 Don’t be careless, Naruto!
 R-Right!
 You guys can just relax and watch. Don’t follow me around!
 What?!
 I’m saying I don’t want an impediment.
 You!
 Calm down. Let’s join forces here.
 – Not with a guy like this! – Not with a guy like this!
 They seem to strangely be in harmony, these two.
 All right, everybody!
 The Todoroki Great Shrine Race will start soon!
 Wasabi Family's runner, ldate Morino!
 Idate…Morino?
 Wagarashi Family’s runner, Fukusuke Hikyakuya!
 On your mark!
 Start!
 All right! We’re going too!
 Wh-What the--?!
 Is he running away?!
 Where are you going, Idate?!
 Hey, wait!
 Wh-What is he doing…?
 Wait!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 What the heck is he thinking?! That idiot!
 So fast. He's moving at an incredible speed.
 Darn it! The opponent's already far out at sea!
 This is bad!
 If the distance between them gets any greater, it'll be impossible to win!
 That idiot!
 – Kick it up a notch, Sakura! – Right!
 We're gonna bring him back at all cost and make up the difference!
 Next time: ""The Race is On! Trouble on the High Seas!""
 Don't miss it!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears

 Yahoo!
 Roar and Howl! The Ultimate Tag-Team!
 Got you!
 Damn!
 What’s going on?!
 I felt a response to my attack, but it didn’t work.
 And where did his attack come from?
 Listen, Akamaru.
 We’re gonna attack from both sides with Fang Over Fang.
 Here we go!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 This doesn’t look so good.
 I’ll play a melody of death for you.
 What’s with this guy?
 What?!
 Two on two is perfect, right, Sakon?
 How could the Sound Ninja Four take so much time?
 Did they send such strong people after them who could hold them up…
 or are they playing around too much?
 Well, the one that’s probably delaying things is…
 either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot, or Kidomaru who likes to play.
 But the one that’s the most dangerous
 when he loses his temper is Sakon.
 He’s not satisfied until he kills his opponent,
 even though he should just leave things be.
 He thinks he’s the strongest of the four, so he shows off.
 I wonder if that’s so…
 Tayuya has a personality that’s neck and neck with Sakon.
 But in any case, nothing bad will happen
 since we sent that kid…
 Kimimaro.
 He’ll surely clean up anything that is not good for me.
 I will never let you take Sasuke!
 There’s a lot of trash scattered about.
 But after all, trash is trash.
 It simply needs to be cleaned up.
 Shut up!
 Come on.
 I’ll crush you!
 So this is the so-called melody of death.
 So she’s manipulating them with the sound of the flute.
 Damn! She’s getting further and further away.
 What should I do?! What is it that I should do?!
 Huh?!
 This is really looking bad!
 Akamaru!
 Oh, so you’re the real one!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 One more!
 My brother and I get along very well.
 Usually, my older brother Ukon sleeps inside of me,
 but when there’s a fight he comes out and helps out.
 This is this guy’s ability.
 Ukon can stick out his arms and legs, his head,
 from anywhere in my body and attacks or defends.
 Like this you see…
 Multiple Legs Barrage!
 It’s a three-legged kick. Works well, doesn’t it?
 So next, it’s…!
 There’s no time to waste, Sakon.
 We’ll finish this quickly! Get into the second state!
 All right, all right…
 You’re too impatient, bro.
 I see, you’re saying those horns aren’t just for display, huh?
 As soon as that right one came out,
 his Chakra increased by several tenfold.
 Shoot!
 It seemed hopeless before, but now it’s really bad.
 What’s your liking, bro?
 In pieces.
 So now, perhaps it’s time to get serious.
 I’ll take care of you all at once.
 Such confident words! But those are my lines!
 Shoot! These guys are persistent!
 But it’s starting to get clearer to me.
 But the problem is from here on out.
 Damn! Am I completely out of hands?
 What?! You’re saying we’re gonna do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 It’s too dangerous to do it here without our comrades!
 You understand, don't you?
 If we use that Jutsu,
 both you and I will use up most of our Chakra
 and won’t be able to move.
 If we miss, we’ll die here in vain.
 Akamaru…
 What a pitiful master I am… that you had to bite me.
 I understand, Akamaru.
 Just like you said, we only have that left!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Do it well…Akamaru!
 Show them the results of the training!
 It’s Dynamic Marking!
 Playing dirty like that!
 All preparations are done!
 Inuzuka-Style! Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 I wondered what it was going to be and
 it turned out to be a drooling runt of a dog.
 What can a dog like this do?
 Take this!
 Drool?!
 Sakon, what’re you doing! To the right!
 Damn!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Heh! How’s that!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speed is too fast.
 It’s such an intense high revolution that even our visibility becomes zero.
 Even without direct contact, flesh is cut…
 A direct hit from the blow and you’re in pieces.
 Really…getting carried away…
 This is perfect. We were just thinking of separating soon.
 What?! He divided into two people?!
 It’s true…
 Had we fully received the blow as one, it would’ve been bad, but…
 The real battle begins now.
 Damn it…
 Yeah… I know Akamaru.
 One more shot of Wolf Fang Over Fang.
 The next one is our limit.
 We’ll take them down with this!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 It’s no use hiding!
 I told you we don’t chase with our eyes!
 We attack by chasing smells we’ve marked with our noses!
 – A! 					– Un!
 – Summoning… 					– Summoning…
 – Rashomon! 					– Rashomon!
 That’s an impressive power…
 To turn Rashomon,
 the ultimate shield to protect Lord Orochimaru into this shape.
 But…
 – This is the end! – This is the end!
 Akamaru!
 Akamaru… To protect me, you…
 Damn! He did it again!
 My eyes…!
 Damn!
 Damn…! This time it’s not ordinary piss!
 It feels like my eyes are burning with strong acid!
 Where’s the other one?!
 Hey…
 Who are you looking for?
 I’ll take care of the rest. Go wash your eyes in that river.
 This is my ability… specialized in assassination, of course.
 You can’t beat me by just having a good nose and nails.
 You can’t beat my ability!
 You know that the Chakra Network through which Chakra flows
 is deeply interwoven with each internal organ, right?
 The Chakra Network is interwoven in a variety of complicated ways
 and is linked to the tissues that make up each organ.
 Also to each cell that makes up the tissues,
 as well as even to proteins, which are the main component of cells…
 At the second state,
 I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells or proteins as I wish by using Chakra.
 To put it simply,
 I can turn my body into tiny pieces, enter my opponent’s body…
 return to my original form and come back out.
 Akamaru…
 I’m sorry… Akamaru…!
 We’ve always done things together…
 we were together, always and everywhere.
 Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!
 Yahoo! We’re lucky that the people who got into our trap had Earth Scroll!
 With our luck like this, we’ll reach the goal first.
 Akamaru is frightened all of a sudden.
 He can smell the strength of an oppoenent’s Chakra.
 I’ve never seen him this scared…
 The people fighting over there must be something..
 The Seventh Round Battle. Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.
 Hey! First of all, don’t you bring a puppy in here!
 He’ll get in the way of our battle!
 Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!
 Now then…
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Eat this!
 There!
 Naruto… I'm taking Akamaru back.
 Wh-What?! What did you feed him? His coating has changed to red!
 That’s why his name is Akamaru.
 Let’s go, Akamaru!

 However, this one time, I’m sunk…
 My cells can swim inside your body as I wish,
 and I can even create parts that are only you.
 In other words, a little bit of a fusion condition.
 A sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.
 A sharing?
 That’s right…and a cruel way of killing that only I can accomplish…
 The gradual scraping away of just your cells.
 I see.
 If that’s the case…!
 If I do this, what’s gonna happen?
 Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!
 Die with me…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you

 Grandma Sansho, the curry of life!
 One…
 Two!
 I'll look after Lee.
 So give Neji and Naruto some curry!
 Ranmaru, wait here.
 Right.
 I’m going to Naruto! Please look after Lee.
 You too, get your butt to Neji!
 Oh… right, Mom.
 Right… Open Lee’s mouth.
 Oh, right!
 Here!
 So even the curry of life won’t work, huh…?
 Oh my!
 Oh my…
 You little--! This isn’t the time to be passing out!
 Hot!
 What’re you doing, believe it?!
 Are you awake?
 Oh, Tenten? Didn’t you fall off the cliff?!
 You should’ve realized that was his trap!
 What?! I was totally snow-jobbed, believe it!
 Neji, Neji!
 It’s the curry of life! Eat this and get better.
 Neji?!
 Neji!
 Oh my, thank goodness he got better!
 What?
 The world is spinning…
 He’s acting kind of strange…
 Oh my…
 One, two…
 Put the curry of life in this, pot and all.
 Okay.
 Hot!
 Oww!
 Oh! The curry…
 This is bad!
 Don’t worry about it. Move it!
 On account of that wine…
 Will he be okay?
 Oh my, there’s a slight problem with the ingredients…
 But there shouldn’t be much difference in efficacy.
 But…
 Oh my…!
 He’s coming this way.
 It’s okay! I’ll go…
 You’re still alive?! I have to finish you off…
 Raiga…
 You’re alive, Ranmaru?!
 It’s Ranmaru!
 That kid gave Raiga his own Chakra and brought him back to life…
 What?!
 Raiga looked at Ranmaru who was unconscious
 and assumed he was dead…
 So that’s why he was saying all that gibberish
 about Ranmaru watching from high above.
 And I managed to get Ranmaru to the Curry of Life Shop.
 So that’s what happened…
 We’ll again be together forever, Ranmaru…
 Let’s kill them and have fun doing lots of bad things.
 Right, Raiga…
 Some fog has appeared.
 It’s okay. I’ll be your eyes again, Raiga…
 Right. There’s nothing to be afraid of if I’m with you, Ranmaru.
 Now, let’s go, Raiga!
 What about them?
 They’re dead now…
 Right…Shall we search for our next prey?
 But there’s a precipitous cliff ahead!
 That Ranmaru, what’s he going to do?!
 Could it be…
 he’s going to atone for the past sins together with Raiga?!
 He might be planning to lead Raiga over that cliff and die together!
 Wh-What?!
 What’s with you, jerk?!
 What?!
 Lee…
 Hey…
 Here I go…!
 What?!
 You…brat!
 He suddenly recovered!
 Knock it off!
 He’s fast!
 You okay, Ranmaru?
 You stay here!
 Take me with you…
 Oh! Ranmaru!
 Where’d you go, Ranmaru?!
 You little--! You’re going to pay for this!
 Ninja Art: Thunder Armor!
 Now…
 Bring it!
 Knock it off!
 Here I go…
 That was a heck of a blow.
 If I hadn’t put on the Thunder Armor; I’d be giving myself a funeral.
 In order to remember your hard work I’ll give you your funeral myself!
 Wait!
 What’s the idea…?
 I want to feed you… the curry of life, too.
 Huh?!
 You’ll realize that you’re not alone if you eat the curry…
 Everyone’s feelings are blended in…
 What’re you saying?!
 Let’s stop hurting people…
 Cut it out!
 You’re my eyes and ears!
 We’ll no longer be two people in one if you say such selfish things!
 Shoot your lightning…
 If I die, the strong Raiga will also die… We’re two in one, so…
 I…won’t be able to remember you from when you were cool…
 I must give you a funeral!
 Stop…Raiga!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 There are lots of Narutos…
 Did I get drunk?
 You little--! It makes no difference, no matter how many of you there are!
 Neji, wake up!
 What’re you doing, Neji?
 Eat this and get it together! We’ve got trouble here!
 That’s…
 What?!
 Now we’ve done it…
 You’re going to kill by your own hand the friend who risked his life to save you?!
 Wha--?! Ranmaru betrayed me…
 He broke the promise for it to be just us two forever!
 He’s not all alone anymore!
 He figured out that it’s more fun…
 to laugh with everyone than to cry with you!
 Naruto…
 Ranmaru, you were going to die with Raiga, weren’t you?!
 Don’t be thinking about something like that anymore!
 You’re free now!
 Don't worry. I won’t let Raiga give you a funeral, no matter what!
 Hey, don’t be shooting off your mouth, you shrimp.
 Say what?!
 Don’t underestimate me. I’m Raiga Kurosuki!
 I’ve been counted before as one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 I won’t take orders from the likes of you!
 Oh. That’s right. He’s a Ninja Swordsman, huh?
 If you’re one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,
 then I’ve got something to ask you.
 You know the guy called Kisame, right?!
 Kisame? I hate that guy!
 So I’ll give him a funeral for sure the next time I see him!
 What?!
 I hate him.
 I hate all the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist!
 Ranmaru. You’re the only one who’s a friend to me…
 But Ranmaru… you’ve made other friends…
 We’re not two in one anymore…
 Raiga…
 Impudent!
 Who do you think taught you about the outside world?!
 It’s a funeral for you!
 Clone Spinning Axe Kick!
 You little…
 Clone… Body Slam!
 Ranmaru…
 Now you're free…
 Raiga?!
 Thunder! Give me my funeral!
 One, two… One…
 Not loud enough!
 – You can’t make genuine curry of life… – One, two…
 – if you don’t stir it with all your heart! – One, two…
 Oh my!
 Ouch… What’re you doing, Mom?!
 Oh my, Karashi!
 It’s a hundred years too soon for you to be uttering the word ""genuine""!
 You too, start your training over again from the beginning!
 What?!
 Grandma Sansho!
 We’ll be leaving now!
 Thanks for your help.
 I leave Ranmaru to you!
 Oh my… I’ll train him mercilessly as a successor…
 to the preparation of the curry of life!
 Good luck, Ranmaru, Karashi.
 – Thanks! 					– Thanks!
 Oh my… It’s a long way to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 I made you guys some special curry
 that’ll give you guys ten thousand times the strength.
 Be on your way after having some.
 What’s this very spicy-looking bright red color…?
 It kind of hurts my eyes, believe it!
 Oh! That looks good!
 – What? Seriously?! – What? Seriously?!
 Lady Tsunade will get mad at us if we don’t get back soon!
 You're right!
 Unfortunately, we’ll have to be going now.
 Wait!
 Oh my, those kids were sure diffident and reserved…
 The curry… The curry…!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 One’s duty as team captain:
 ""Issue appropriate instructions to the subordinates,
 protect the lives of your men and promptly carry out your mission.""
 Awesome, that is so cool!
 This is so perfect for me, Naruto, the man who will eventually become a Hokage!
 All right, I’ll use this to instantly get closer to the title of Hokage, believe it!
 Next time: “Follow My Lead! The Great Survival Challenge!”

 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.
 Yes, precious things are never in shape

 Hey! Open up!
 Huh?
 What’s all this noise at this hour?
 Idiots! I told you not to let your eyes off him, didn’t I?
 Could Gaara have…?
 Where on earth did he go?
 I hope nothing bad happens, but…
 Hospital Beseiged: The Evil Hand Revealed!
 Wow, he’s sound asleep… I wonder if he’s dead?
 If that’s for Sasuke, he’s not back yet.
 Hmm.
 Ino…
 I’m way ahead of you on Sasuke information.
 Missed your chance on that one, eh, Billboard Brow?
 No! This is for Lee!
 Huh?
 The one from before should be wilted by now too…
 Oh.
 Lee! Stop it!
 191…
 Don’t touch me!
 I’m…not…done yet…
 Here.
 Thanks.
 I hope Lee’s better.
 Yeah.
 Huh?
 What the…?
 Oh man, it’s all clogged up. What a drag…
 Yo!
 You finally woke up, eh?
 Where…am I?
 In the hospital!
 They told me that you’ve been sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!
 Three days…
 Three days and three nights?!
 W-What?
 Shikamaru! When does the final competition start?
 T-Tomorrow.
 What?!
 Why didn’t you wake me up earlier!
 I can’t be just snoozing through in a place like this!
 And what about Pervy Sage?
 Where’s Pervy Sage?!
 I’ve got to have him watch over my training.
 Huh? What are you talking about, all of a sudden?
 I don’t know what’s got into you.
 Huh? My clothes are missing!
 Where are they? Where, where?
 – Sleeping away like you’re in a coma, – Gone!
 – then running around out of control. – Where're my clothes?!
 Settle down a little!
 You know what? lt isn’t gonna make a difference
 if you rush around one day beforehand.
 Resting is training, too, you know…
 Huh? Hey…Naruto.
 What in the world is going on?
 I’m…so…hungry….
 Don’t keep scaring me like that…
 Oh yeah.
 It’s such a drag but…
 I bought this fruit basket as a get-well present for Choji.
 But the doctor said he couldn’t have it.
 So let’s eat it together.
 Choji? Is he that sick?
 No, no, don’t be fooled.
 He got sick from eating too much BBQ.
 That’s just like him!
 Yeah well, and neither of you are the type to have female visitors.
 So here…
 Looks good.
 W-What is it?
 Since Choji can’t have any, let’s eat in front of him.
 What a drag this guy is!
 Huh?
 No one’s here.
 Out to lunch?
 Oh well…
 Okay!
 Hmm?
 Lee, I’m putting the flowers here, okay?
 I’m still hungry!
 Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?
 Oh yeah.
 Why…save him?
 He’s an important subordinate whom I care for.
 My body…isn’t moving.
 You jerk!
 What the hell do you think you’re doing?!
 Hey Naruto…
 During Shadow Possession Jutsu, it’s moving me too! Okay?!
 Sorry! Shikamaru.
 What the hell were you trying to do?
 Choji, are you better?
 Oh, Ino!
 All right! The age of the chubby has arrived!
 What were you trying to do to Bushy Brow here?!
 I was trying to kill him.
 What?!
 How can he be so calm?
 Especially when he is not able to move with my Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 Why’d you have to do something like that?
 You beat him in the match, right?
 Do you have a personal grudge against him or something?
 I don't have anything like that.
 I just wanted to kill him, that’s it.
 How can you say something so selfish, you bastard?!
 You…you had a lousy upbringing, didn’t you?
 All you care about is yourself.
 Or there’s something weird about him. lt gives me the chills!
 If he tries anything, it’ll be too much of a burden for me and Naruto…
 What the heck should we do?
 If you get in my way, I’ll kill you both too.
 What?! Go ahead, if you can!
 Hey Naruto, hold on!
 Should I try to scare him with a bluff?
 I know you’re strong from seeing you in the competition with him…
 But…we can keep up with you.
 We didn’t show you our best skills in the preliminaries.
 And it’s two against one!
 You’re the one who’s at a disadvantage.
 If you’re smart, you’ll do what I tell you and just get lost.
 I’ll say it again… if you get in my way…
 I’ll kill you.
 Where the heck do you get off…?!
 There’s no way in hell I’ll let you do that!
 I’ve been telling you to back off, haven’t I?
 This guy has the strength of a monster. You get it, don’t you?
 I have a real monster in me! I’m not going to lose to this guy!
 Huh?
 I heard Naruto was here too, so I came to see, but…
 What a mess…
 Well, I guess this means he’s okay.
 Huh?
 What’s worth making him mad, you idiot!
 A monster, huh…?
 Me too, actually.
 It’s just like you said. I had a terrible upbringing.
 When I came into this world,
 I took the life of the woman some might call my mother.
 So that I could become the strongest Shinobi…
 my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessed by a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 A Sand Spirit?
 It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of an old monk
 from Village Hidden in the Sand who was sealed inside the tea caldron.
 It must be a type of cacodemon possession Jutsu,
 performed to a baby before it is born.
 To go that far… they must have been totally nuts.
 Is it possible…that there could be something inside him too?
 What a thing for a parent to be doing! Such a twisted kind of love.
 Love?
 Don’t measure me by your standards.
 Family, huh…
 Let me tell you what kind of ties I have to my family.
 They’re ties of hatred, ties of murderous intent…
 My family’s just lumps of flesh.
 Nourished with the life of my mother,
 I was crafted as the ultimate masterpiece of the village…
 The Kazekage’s child.
 I was taught by my father the innermost secrets of the Shinobi…
 spoiled, over-protected, and left on my own.
 And I thought that was love…
 Until that incident happened.
 That incident…?!
 What are you talking about?
 Just what happened?!
 In the six years since the time when I was 6 years old…
 My real father has tried to assassinate me more times than I can count!
 But I thought you just said that your father spoiled you…
 What’s going on here?
 Those who are too strong are apt to become feared.
 Born through the Jutsu, my mind was unstable…
 I guess the idiots in my village
 finally realized that I had emotional problems…
 For my father, Kazekage,
 at the same time I was the ultimate weapon for the village,
 I was also a dangerous, fearsome presence.
 It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure as soon as I turned six.
 And I was treated politely simply because I was feared.
 To them, now I’m just a relic of the past that they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 When I asked myself that, I couldn’t find the answer.
 But, as long as you’re alive, you need a reason…
 If you don’t have one, it’s just the same as being dead.
 What’s this guy saying?
 I…can understand that…
 He…is the same as me.
 So this is the answer I came to…
 I am living in order to kill human beings other than myself.
 After living in the fear of never knowing when I might be murdered,
 finally I became calm.
 By killing assassins, I finally comprehended the reason why I live…
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myself…
 And if I see that all other people in this world exist
 only to make me realize that,
 there could be no world more wonderful.
 And as long as there are others to kill
 who can make me feel this happiness to be alive,
 I will never disappear.
 W-What’s this freak talking about…?
 He’s real gone!
 I was also alone…
 And suffered ‘cause I didn’t know why I was alive…
 But Iruka Sensei recognized me for who I was…
 and that was the first time I realized why I lived…
 But this guy… this guy grew up alone.
 And he ony feels alive when he kills other people.
 H-How can there be someone like this?
 The worlds we live in are too different…!
 There’s no way… that I can beat a guy like this!
 W-What’s wrong, Naruto?
 What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should have stopped him from moving, but…
 Naruto!
 Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!
 What a drag this guy is!
 Naruto!
 Now, let me feel it…!
 Oh no!
 Stop right there!
 Tomorrow’s the final round!
 There’s no need to rush like this!
 Or do you just want to stay here starting today?
 Don’t leave me alone!
 I’m not bleeding, but it hurts a lot right here.
 What…am I?!
 I will…kill you all without a fail.
 Just wait.

134,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’ve…had it…
 Oh, Sakura!
 For crying out loud, how far have we walked?
 The tower hasn’t gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see it right in front of our eyes.
 Strange…
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that we’re already within the enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Huh?
 Oh, that can’t be!
 What on earth is going on?!
 No way!
 Is it Genjutsu…?
 So it seems. We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we were meticulously careful,
 and were made to walk around the same place in a circle.
 We’re being watched…
 Probably.
 They intend to wear down our physical strength and
 catch us unprepared when  we’re bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then.... They’ll be coming soon.
 Humph, they’ve appeared.
 This is the perfect handicap.  Believe it!
 Clone vs. Clone: Mine are Better than Yours!
 W-What is this?
 It’s quite a number.
 Moreover, they’re clones?
 Cornered rats.
 Shut up!
 Oh, they’re quite weak, huh?
 Good!
 Naruto!
 W-What are these guys?
 W-What’s going on here?
 I’ll assess this!
 Sharingan!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 W-What’s going on?
 My body’s…
 Are you okay?
 No mistake.
 It’s the real thing, not an illusion.
 – Scroll please. – Scroll please.
 That Kabuto was injured means these things are actual Shadow Clones?!
 B-But... even though Shadow clones are supposed to vanish
 if they take a direct attack, these things don't vanish.
 Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!
 Which is it?!
 Scroll please.
 Scroll please.
 Give me scroll.
 Dang it!
 It’s futile!
 Stop!
 These things are illusions.
 It’s an enemy Genjutsu.
 B-But, Kabuto’s wound is the real thing.
 No, it’s as Sasuke says.
 Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere…
 and coordinating their attack with movements of the “Genjutsu Shinobis”
 and attacking from a different location.
 Pretending as if those Genjutsu Shinobis are attacking.
 – Scroll please. – Scroll please.
 Then I’ll find the idiot who’s behind the scenes
 throwing Kunai knives and kick his butt, believe it!
 Hold it, Naruto.
 We’ve been deceived as to the source of the Kunai knives…
 so we can’t discover the precise location of the enemy like this.
 Do you get it?
 That is the enemy’s purpose.
 From a data standpoint, it’s a type who is weak at close combat
 and Taijutsu that likes this kind of attack. 95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29 							The true enemy won’t come out 		until we can’t move at all.
 Listen, everyone!
 In any case,
 all there is to do now is to fend off the enemy attack.
 Fine, if that’s what their plan is…
 Now then… I wonder how far they can hold out.
 The night is long.
 Man! 					This is endless!
 Since it’s come to this…!
 Stop!
 Naruto, don’t waste your Chakra!
 Even if you attack these things, there’s no point!
 If I hit them all in a single sweep,
 the enemy won’t fire inadvertently while these things are reverting back.
 The hiding place will be discovered, so.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clones?!
 It’s not over yet!
 Sasuke, what should we do…?
 Man, that loser. All there is to do is go for it!
 B-But…
 Indeed…
 It’s not a situation that he can get through by himself.
 Let’s go, Sakura!
 Y-Yeah!
 I’m not finished yet…
 Dawn is breaking.
 It’s finally time for the hunt.
 Mubi, that’s enough.
 We’re finished hunting their spirits.
 Now what’s left is just their bodies.
 Lucky.
 You’re…the one who… did my left shoulder.
 I finally found you.
 You really hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 You…really hung me up.
 Lucky.
 I can finally even the score.
 Heh!
 Cornered rats.
 It went well, Naruto!
 W-What the heck are these guys?!
 T-This can’t be!
 Since when…?!
 Idiot!
 You finally showed your true colors, punk!
 T-This brat, don’t tell me…
 The Shadow Clone is just the preparation for the trick...
 for me to portray every member of the team by myself!
 At the same time Naruto lifted the Shadow Clone,
 the three of us hid.
 The Genjutsu users were adversely deceived.
 Naruto!
 Naruto, you’ve used too much Chakra.
 I’ll do the rest.
 No way! I’m not always going to have the good parts taken away!
 Is this really that Naruto…?
 Since when had he improved this much?
 That’s some brat…
 I can’t believe he can still move.
 Naruto…
 Amazing Chakra stamina…
 Right after a Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 a daring technique that transforms just three of the bodies into his companions.
 To think he can still move even after doing all that.
 Here it’s the fifth day now.
 This kid will transform
 if he can just master the use of his Chakra.
 Not bad.
 But we’re still not unlucky.
 There’s no time.
 This time around, we’ll show you our Ninjutsu!
 Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow clones?
 No, they are plain clones.
 However, he's up to something.
 Be careful!
 Hah! If they are just clones, then there’s one real body.
 I’ll kick their butts right and left until I run into him.
 You idiot.
 Such a tactless thing…
 I’m telling you!
 I’m saying don’t stick your nose in!
 Naruto!
 That’s reckless!
 Cripes!
 From earlier, the nape of my neck hurts when I use the Sharingan.
 Maybe I used too much Chakra.
 Dang it!
 Dang it. A clone?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 This one, too?!
 Naruto! Stop!
 Are they all fakes?!
 Or could it be Genjutsu again?!
 This is… the last…Chakra.
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke!
 The bruise again…
 Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!
 It won’t do to create an opening!
 Kabuto!
 Darn it!
 Stop! Naruto!
 No matter how much you swing at them,
 the real body isn’t in those clones.
 Then where’s the enemy attacking us from?!
 If they are merely clones, the clones themselves can’t attack!
 If I knew that, we wouldn’t be having a rough time of it!
 This is the enemy’s scheme.
 Man, I can’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore…
 They’ve about reached their limit.
 Lucky.
 That’s it!
 The real body hides with the Earth Style Jutsu
 and attacks from behind a clone!
 Kabuto!
 Heh, “it won’t do to create an opening,” right?!
 Thank you, Naruto. You saved me.
 We're okay here, Naruto!
 What happened there?  Are you hurt?
 That’s a terrible bruise.
 It’s nothing.
 Here it is, here it is!
 Look, the Heaven scroll!
 Good for you.
 There’s something about this guy... that I don’t like.
 Oh, it’s you guys.
 You’re late, Kabuto.
 I got a bit involved in something.
 Sorry.
 But, but… thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.
 No, it’s because you guys fought hard.
 You were amazing at the end, Naruto.
 We’re going through this door.
 Well then, I wish us both luck.
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 What of the harvest?
 Yes.
 More than I expected.
 I filled in his entire data from this second exam.
 You need this, right?
 So, how was it?
 Sure enough, it appears you’re curious.
 Master Orochimaru.
 I want to ask your opinion.
 As a Sound Village’s spy…
 That’s not necessary, is it?
 You will be the one to decide it all, so…
 I like that cleverness of yours.
 Good work.
 There’s nobody here.
 I’m okay now, Sakura.
 O-Okay.
 That’s too bad!
 Cha!
 Say-say, what’re we supposed to do?
 Oh! Look at that…
 Without… Heaven… I don’t get it at all.
 If “Heaven” does not exist,
 enrich your knowledge, and prepare for the chance.
 If “Earth” does not exist,
 run the fields in search of an advantage.
 Open the series of Heaven and Earth,
 and the perilous way shall be redressed…
 This is namely the secret of “the one that guides…”
 What’s that?
 It looks like there are letters or something missing there.
 It’s probably has to do with the scroll.
 I think this means we’re supposed to open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
 Okay then, I’m going to open it.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What’s this, what’s this?
 Here I thought that the really strong ones were remaining,
 but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru, all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.
 And that Lee’s team, too.
 So much for getting all inflated.
 Well, I’m the man who’s going to become the Hokage.
 I must impress them and
 show that I’m not in the same class as any ordinary blockhead!

 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.
 Yes, precious things are never in shape
 You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
 Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
 Even if you get lost, let's start walking
 One more time
 Your destiny is to lose to me. For sure.
 You don’t know until you try!
 Your father was killed a long time ago
 and I don’t know the extent of the pain you’ve felt…
 But it’s a huge mistake for you to think that has determined your entire destiny!
 You’re hopeless…
 Proctor…it’s over.
 You failure…
 A Failure's True Power
 Don’t…run away.
 I won’t…run…
 I’ll…stand by my own words…
 That’s my Ninja Way!
 I’ll…
 stand…
 by my own…
 words!
 That’s my…Ninja Way…
 I think I’ve heard that line before…
 You with your destiny stuff…
 I won’t lose…
 to a jerk with cold feet like you, no matter what!
 Naruto…
 A brat who knows nothing shouldn’t lecture arrogantly!
 People are born burdened with an inherent destiny that they cannot defy.
 Neji…live…
 You’re a man who is blessed with Hyuga ability
 more than anyone in the family…
 I wanted you…to be born into the head family…
 You can’t possibly understand
 the destiny of being burdened with a mark that cannot be wiped off for life!
 Yeah…
 I do understand it.
 So…what of it?
 This brat!
 Don’t be acting cool…
 It’s not just you who’s special!
 Hinata was also… suffering the same as you!
 Even though she’s the head family, not being acknowledged as such…
 trying desperately to change herself…
 She fought you while coughing up blood with that in mind!
 You too!
 The branch family that protects the head family…
 Doing all that to Hinata just because it’s an exam.
 In actuality, you were just as frantic
 in attempting to go against destiny, right?
 Vitality has returned to Hinata’s face!
 Just what I’d expect of the Anbu Black Ops…
 She'll be okay.
 Now she needs bed rest.
 Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut…
 How are you, who can’t use Chakra for awhile, planning to fight?
 At the end of the day,
 you and Miss Hinata have the same destiny!
 Shut up!
 With your Byakugan, labeling people and talking like you understand!
 Then…show me whether what you’re saying is true or not.
 I will! I’ll defeat you no matter what and prove that to you!
 Dang it… Dang it!
 That being said, I don’t feel Chakra at all.
 It feels like when I used up my Chakra in the training.
 You possess two kinds of Chakra…
 You must extract and utilize, at any time,
 the other huge Chakra that has rested inside you from the start…
 That’s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra… I’ll use that…
 Stinking fox… 					Help me out!
 This is as far as the talking goes.
 Proctor… I’m going to fight with the intent to kill him!
 If you’re going to stop me, please feel free.
 Jeez.
 Didn’t I tell you it is pointless?
 This time, I really can’t lose!
 I’ll win no matter what!
 It’s futile…I pressed the Chakra Points…
 No matter what…
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me kick that Neji’s butt!
 A failure beats down a genius with effort…
 His opponent might be me…
 But even if that’s you, Naruto, no hard feelings.
 Why do you try to go against your destiny that much?
 Because I was called…
 a failure!
 No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.
 What’s the meaning of this…?
 H-He…! 					What in the world…?!
 W-What is he…?!
 It can’t be… This Chakra!
 T-That’s…impossible!
 No way! His Chakra Points have been pressed!
 This Chakra… lt’s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt…
 When did he master the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…?!
 Here I go!
 It’s twisting…
 What’s that?! ls that even Chakra?!
 Awesome power. More so than during the training…
 I feel it!
 Rotation!
 What?!
 His speed’s gone up! What in the world is going on?!
 You!
 You’re confident in close combat, right?!
 You’re going to become the Hokage…?
 I don’t… think so.
 Only a very small percentage of Ninja are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokage are born with destiny.
 It’s not something you become by trying to become it.
 It’s determined by destiny.
 People must live within their different respective currents
 that can’t be gone against.
 I don’t know what the Hyuga destiny of hatred is!
 But if you’re going to say it’s futile, you don’t have to do anything!
 This is bad! I must use the Rotation!
 After I become the Hokage…
 I’ll change Hyuga!
 What Chakra…
 That kid showed some enormous strength…
 The Hyuga kid is probably…
 Say! Which one’s Naruto?!
 I don’t know, either!
 Neji’s Rotation is a technique where the body rotates,
 and dodges and repels the opponent’s Chakra!
 It looks like there was more damage done to Naruto
 since he plunged right into the Rotation.
 There’s no Genin that can beat Neji…
 But Naruto, you’re incredible…
 To think you’d force him this far…
 Failure boy… Sorry, but this is the reality…
 Now this is really the en…
 My body…
 So he left a Shadow clone in the hole and spotted a chance to win, huh…
 Believing in victory, thinking about what’s next
 and acting even when getting knocked around, huh…
 The power of believing in oneself.
 That becomes the power to change destiny…
 He knows this… And he’s a natural to boot.
 In those conditions,
 you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu just like that…
 The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?
 I was careless…
 I’ve…failed the graduation exam three times…
 As luck would have it,
 the Ninjutsu tests that appeared on the graduation exam were always…
 infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
 Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu… I stunk at.
 Don’t be whining about boring stuff like destiny and what not,
 and how it can’t be changed!
 Because unlike me… you’re not a failure.
 Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

136,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’ll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Sakura Blossoms!
 Huh?!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that and is the speed of sound!
 Lee!
 My left ear...
 There’s a little gimmick I have.
 Evading won’t work... on my attacks.
 What is he going to do?!
 It’s sound.
 Even though you evaded my fist, sound assaulted you.
 Sound?
 Do you know what sound is all about in the first place?
 Vibration?
 Correct. In other words, hearing sounds means,
 that the eardrum is catching vibrating air.
 And the human eardrum breaks with sounds over 150 Mhz.
 Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal which is located even deeper,
 I can make you totally lose balance.
 You won’t be able to move your body freely for sometime.
 Something old and tired like Taijutsu don’t work on us.
 Well, you were doing good up to a certain point,
 but I brought forth my Jutsu.
 It’s just not gonna work anymore.
 I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves and air pressure,
 and have the power to obliterate even boulders!
 Primary Lotus!
 I can send air into the ground
 and change the dirt into a cushion as I please.
 It’s different from your silly Jutsu.
 Blast it!
 Lee, it is all right to use this Jutsu
 to protect someone precious.
 Protect... someone precious?
 In any case,
 I’m impressed that you were able to master it, little man!
 You did it quite well, Lee!
 Darn it!
 Okay, then!
 Next is...
 You!
 Darn it!
 He’s coming!
 What?!
 No way!
 Lee!
 Leaf...
 Hurricane!
 It looks like my earlier attack is having an effect!
 I’m somewhat surprised...
 but there’s not even a trace of that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
 This arm amplifies sounds from within to its maximum.
 It’s a speaker of sorts!
 Lee!
 And the assault sound isn’t limited by the direction of my arm...
 it always converges on the targeted prey by my Chakra!
 Lee!
 Now then... 					The final blow.
 I won’t let you!
 Oh, well.
 Hey, let’s get outta here!
 Those guys are pretty dangerous!
 It looks like Sasuke and Naruto are only unconscious, but...
 even that guy Lee’s been messed up and Sakura’s alone.
 What’re you gonna do, Ino?
 What do you mean?
 Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble!
 You’re all right with that?
 Huh?!
 You two were once close friends, weren’t you?
 By the way...
 What Sakura, don’t be so stiff!
 Well...
 Ino, I hear you also...
 What is it?
 ...like Sasuke.
 Then, that means from now on,
 you and I are rivals.
 Why... why am I recalling things from that time?
 Hey, Ino!
 What’re you gonna do?!
 I know, but there’s nothing I can do!
 I can’t heedlessly go out there, can I?!
 Even if I went out now...
 I’d be taken down without a doubt.
 I also...
 I also...!
 Air pressure! The shurikens got bounced back?!
 Your hair’s shinier than mine.
 Hey! If you have time to worry about your hair,
 you should practice!
 Getting all spiced up like a woman...
 Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guy right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
 Yeah! That sounds great!
 Hey hey...
 I won’t let you do such a thing!
 Don’t move!
 Sakura.
 My body... It has no strength.
 I...
 Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet!
 I’m always being protected.
 It's so frustrating!
 This time for sure... I had thought!
 This time for sure...
 I must protect people precious to me... so I thought!
 So...
 Let’s do this!
 Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are gonna get it, too!
 W-What should I do?!
 That’s pointless!
 That won’t work on me!
 What are you saying?
 Huh?
 What?!
 I always...
 act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja.
 I always say that I like Sasuke.
 I always act like I know everything and lecture Naruto.
 I always just... watch them from behind.
 And yet...
 Tazuna, get back!
 Get back!
 Now then...
 Let’s get wild!
 This is the only way to take him down!
 Sasuke!
 Here it is!
 Those two always covered my back and fought for me.
 Lee, you say that you like me...
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Primary Lotus!
 With me at your back...
 you risked your life and fought for me.
 I have a feeling that you taught me...
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Humph!
 I want to be like all of you!
 This time...
 I want all of you...
 to watch me...
 ...from behind!
 Sakura?
 Sakura...
 Kin! Kill her!
 Huh! That sign...
 Substitution Jutsu!
 On the right, huh? You think I’m a fool?
 With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
 you think you can come at me?!
 Kin, get out of the way!
 Useless!
 Air pressure 100 percent, ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
 Is that all you can do?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You’re easy to spot...
 You’re above!
 I’ve said it two or three times that that won’t work!
 This is enough... for you!
 Where next?
 Huh?!
 What...?!
 This time... it’s not a substitution!
 Get off me! Hey!
 Sakura...
 You’re always being called “Billboard Brow” and being picked on.
 Who’re you?
 I’m called Ino Yamanaka. How ‘bout you?
 I’m... Sakura.
 Huh? I can’t hear you. Say it louder.
 Sakura Haruno!
 Huh, I see.
 You have a wide forehead.
 So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
 That’s why you hide your forehead with your bangs.
 Like a ghost...
 Sakura, was it?
 Uh-huh...
 Come back here tomorrow.
 I’ll give you something nice.
 Huh?
 Darn, let go!
 See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
 I’ll give you that ribbon.
 T-Thanks.
 But...
 But what?
 My forehead...
 You hide it, so people make more fun of you, you know?!
 You have a cute face Sakura, so you should be more confident!
 More confident!
 Ino...
 Hey, who’s that? Who’s she, Ino?
 Her name’s Sakura.
 Hey, say hello!
 Hello...
 Listen everybody! Listen!
 There’s someone I like! Who do you think it is?
 Hurry up and tell us!
 Don’t say it’s Sasuke?
 Huh? Why’d you know?
 What’re you talking about?
 Sasuke’s really popular, he’s the most popular!
 Huh? Is that so?
 Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals. What should I do?!
 Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately!
 She’s just acting brave and romping around!
 Ino! I’ve heard Sasuke likes girls with long hair.
 ...likes girls with long hair. ...likes girls with long hair.
 Sakura...
 I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
 From now on, we’re rivals.
 Your hair. It’s grown quite a bit.
 Ino...
 Why...
 Why are you on the same team as Sasuke?!
 I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
 Me too! I won’t lose to you, Sakura. No matter what!
 ...Sakura!
 I will...
 I will...
 Give it up!
 It’s really bad...
 Hey, Ino...!
 I must... protect everyone!
 You punk!
 Huh?
 Huh! More strange ones.
 Ino...?
 Sakura! I promised I wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you

 Wow! This is Ino team’s battle?!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 A Battle of Bugs!               The Deceivers and the Deceived!
 What the heck is happening…?
 Why does Hinata have to be kidnapped?!
 Why are there guys who know that we’re searching for Bikochu?!
 We were being watched all this time. Ever since we arrived…
 You were aware of that?!
 You’re the only one who didn’t know.
 Why didn’t you tell me?!
 Because if we told you, you’d have raised a big fuss!
 And the insects would flee! All the insects…!
 Including the Bikochu!
 If they tried to steal the Bikochu from us through force,
 the insects would be in danger of getting hurt.
 So they captured Hinata and decided to go with a hostage exchange.
 That’s very smart of them.
 Something smells sweet…
 It’s the smell of honey.
 Bee’s honey…
 Bees…?
 Hinata’s scent ends here…
 In that case…
 Those guys waited for a moment when Hinata was alone
 and attacked her using bees.
 I’ve heard that in the Hidden Stone Village in the Land of Earth,
 there’s a clan of insect handlers who primarily use bees.
 The name of that clan is… the Kamizuru Clan.
 Kamizuru…? That’s a name that isn’t heard very often.
 Seems they were once hailed as being at a level equal to the Aburame Clan…
 But they aren’t anymore?
 This is a story from the times of my grandfather…
 There was a time when the Shinobi of the Hidden Stone Village
 were going to invade the Leaf Village…
 The Kamizuru Clan was designated to spearhead the operation…
 The plan was to create a disruption by releasing
 a large swarm of bees into the village followed by an invading main unit…
 However, the Aburame Clan wised up to that
 and prepared to engage the enemy in the forest to the west!
 This battle between insect handlers which had no precedent in history…
 ended in the Aburame’s victory…
 With this battle as the turning point,
 the Aburame Clan rose to unchallenged status
 in the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 On the other hand, the Kamizuru Clan was subjected to cold treatment
 even in their own village.
 I’ve heard that only a few of them remain now…
 So those people came here to capture Bikochu, huh?
 What the heck are those guys planning to do with the Bikochu?
 If my insects come back we might be able to learn something…
 I see… I've been captured…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is in a difficult situation right now…
 Because of that incident at the recent Chunin exam?
 The Hokage was assassinated, and I hear they lost many Shinobi too.
 Times are about to change dramatically…
 This is a chance for us, the Kamizuru Clan,
 to distinguish ourselves.
 But to do that…
 The founder’s Book of Secrets, huh?
 A broad range of Forbidden Jutsu for Insect Handlers
 are apparently inscribed therein among other things…
 If we possessed that at the time of the battle with the Aburame Clan,
 we wouldn’t have lost…
 However, Clan members have continued to search for it for many years,
 but couldn’t find it.
 Do you really think we can find it after all this time?
 That’s why we need the Bikochu …
 I brought the keepsakes of the founder, my grandfather, with me…
 When the Bikochu emerges, it will pursue the scent it recognizes.
 And we should be able to locate the Book of Secrets
 that Grandfather hid just as he was dying.
 This strand of his hair will surely lead us to it.
 If we get our hands on the Book of Secrets
 and if we engage in some big action…
 I am certain that… the people of the village will also acknowledge us.
 Those people are also desperately seeking recognition.
 Naruto…
 Did you find out anything? How about Hinata’s whereabouts?
 No… The other insects were probably also done in by those guys.
 Damn! Then our only choice is to do what they want?
 When I went to all that trouble of finding it…
 So you want to desert Hinata?
 H-How could anyone possibly do that?!
 I won’t desert her no matter what might happen!
 Anybody who deserts a comrade is trash!
 Exactly.
 But then we’d be able to locate Sasuke if we have this guy here…
 Well, I guess we’ll have to think of some other method of finding Sasuke.
 Yeah… Right now, the first thing we need to do is rescue Hinata.
 But, do you think Hinata would be satisfied with that?
 The person who originally thought up this plan was Hinata.
 Huh? But…
 It’s true that I told her about the existence of Bikochu…
 However…
 The odds of finding a Bikochu are extremely low…
 We thought that she should aspire to an important mission
 with an assured outcome for the village, rather than a mission with such low odds.
 But Hinata didn’t give up.
 She argued persistently that if there was even a small possibility,
 one should take on the challenge.
 Th-That Hinata did…?
 She was extremely forceful and Shino and I had no choice but to agree.
 It’s the first time Hinata ever volunteered for a mission.
 For that reason too, I want to make this a success.
 Yeah.
 But when we don’t know where Hinata is, how are we…?
 There is one place where Hinata will definitely make an appearance.
 I see! The place where…
 …the exchange with the Bikochu takes place!
 We will definitely have a chance at that time.
 All right! We will recover Hinata without fail…
 and we will also protect the Bikochu to the very end!
 We brought the Bikochu! Return Hinata!
 Place the insect cage on that rock over there!
 Hinata!
 Release Hinata!
 I must verify it first!
 What’s…the meaning of this?!
 Are you trying to make a mockery of our Clan? Of insect handlers?!
 A goliath beetle… You gotta be kidding!
 Now, Shino!
 What?!
 Parasitic Insects!
 Heh! Recovery successful!
 All right!
 Damn!
 Naruto!
 All right, resign yourselves!
 Your time’s up!
 What’s this?
 This one doesn’t smell like Hinata!
 Huh?!
 Just as I thought…
 Beeswax…?
 There they come!
 Damn! You jerk! You jerk!
 Damn! All these things are honey…?!
 Sorry, Naruto… But these damn bees!
 There’s no end to them!
 Do we need to slash them if they’re honey?!
 You two don’t move from there!
 Huh?
 This is the genuine thing! And furthermore, it contains deadly poison.
 It appears that genuine ones are mixed in…
 But they’re indistinguishable from each other!
 Back me up for a little!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 A-Awesome…
 Amazing power for a Genin…
 As might be expected from the Aburame Clan…I guess.
 The Kamizuru Clan…
 Huh…? So you were aware of that fact.
 Return Hinata!
 Of course, our intention was to return her…
 But only if you calmly hand over the Bikochu.
 However…
 It looks like you have no intention of doing that!
 In that case, what do you plan on doing?
 If you’re an insect handler,
 you wouldn’t bring a delicate insect like the Bikochu
 to a dangerous place like a battleground…
 We’ll finish you off right here…
 and take our time afterwards to search for the Bikochu!
 Wall of Insects Jutsu!
 That one doesn’t have any other tricks, huh!
 Shino! Paper Bombs!
 Take this!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Insect Clones…?
 Up to your annoying tricks, huh…
 Shino! What are we gonna do now?!
 Don’t you think we should go back there for a moment?
 Those guys might find the Bikochu!
 No…that location will definitely be safe.
 More importantly, the first thing we need to do is search for Hinata!
 There’s no mistake.
 Inside here.
 Hinata! Where are you?!
 Hey! Be careful!
 There’s no sign of those guys, but it might be a trap…
 Is she there?!
 Hinata…?
 Hinata!
 Are you all right, Hinata?
 I’ll rescue you in a moment!
 Just a little more!
 All right… I got it off!
 Naruto…
 Thank you!
 H-Hinata…?!
 H-Hinata…stop that!
 What do you think you’re doing, out of the blue like that?!
 Who…are you?
 What are you talking about, Shino? That’s Hinata.
 If you’re really Hinata,
 you’d get red in the face and faint if you hugged Naruto.
 – Huh? 					– Oh!
 I see… But Akamaru’s nose wouldn’t fail…
 What? The smell of two people is mingled?
 You’re not Hinata?
 Naruto… It’s me… I’m Hinata, believe me.
 In that case…
 show us what you tried to stick on Naruto’s back right now!
 A Paper Bomb?
 So you were intending to blow up Naruto!
 I thought that would work…
 You are…
 I see, the one on the hill was a clone, huh…
 Wearing Hinata’s clothes…
 That’s how she was able to compromise the smell.
 Where is the real Hinata?!
 I wonder where she could be?
 I see…
 Suzumebachi lured the Aburame Clan, huh?
 Well, it appears that your comrades…
 place more value on the Bikochu than on you.
 There’s nobody else coming to rescue you.
 Jibachi, Let’s search for the Bikochu that those guys hid!
 There’s not much time until sunrise!
 Right!
 Don’t even try to escape.
 If you make even the smallest movement out of the ordinary,
 those bees will cut the string.
 Up ahead is the entrance to a labyrinthine underground water vein…
 If you fall in, you’ll pass into the other world in an instant.
 We don’t wish to kill anyone unnecessarily.
 If you want to live, I suggest you just stay quiet.
 How mortifying… I ended up being a burden to everyone, after all.
 You guys are just like summer insects who fly right into the fire!
 If you’re lucky, we’ll meet again…
 That place isn’t just an ordinary cave.
 Hey! Let go! Shino! Naruto!
 There’s nothing else to grab on to.
 Be patient until I’ve checked the surroundings!
 No!
 A huge number of bee larvae!
 Bee larvae, huh…?
 But what’s with their unusual huge size?
 If you tell me where you hid the Bikochu, I’ll spare your life.
 I refuse!
 Searching for the Bikochu is the mission that we were given!
 Then die!
 Paper Bombs!
 Damn! Let’s go, Akamaru!
 Fang Over Fang!
 That sound is…
 I see… They’re still continuing to fight without giving up.
 This is not the time to be crying…
 There’s no way that I can give up. I suggested this whole thing!
 Byakugan!
 There are 13 bees… attached to the string.
 If I can take them all down at once… I’ll be saved.
 But, to take down bees that small…
 Impossible! This guy…
 I told you before… I don't know…when to give up.
 Naruto…
 Yes… I won’t give up either!
 I need to concentrate and control my Chakra…
 Fang Over Fang!
 How many of them are there…?!
 Kiba!
 I-I can’t muster any strength… Somehow my body is…
 No way!
 The larvae in this hive’s favorite food is Chakra!
 What?!
 As long as you’re in there,
 they’ll go through the wall to suck up the Chakra…
 What’s the matter…?
 So have you decided to tell me the location?
 Now!
 Four…
 Five, six…ten…
 Eleven, twelve, thirteen…
 Damn!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Would you like to be the feed for the larvae…
 or would you like to get out of here and become the prey of this girl here?
 Choose whichever you like!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What should I do? My body won’t move.
 I proposed this mission myself wanting to help Naruto, and yet…
 I don’t want to end up as a burden to everyone anymore,
 that’s what I aimed for, but …
 No, calm down.
 I need to concentrate my Chakra and remember that training!
 I have no choice but to do it now! That is the best I can do right now!

138,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Encounter! The Boy With a Star's Name
 Shizune!
 Is anything wrong?!
 What is it…?
 It’s a protection commission from the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 Is there some kind of problem with that?
 You’ve never heard about it, Shizune?
 The Village Hidden in the Stars is small in terms of scale,
 but they are very proud and have often caused trouble…
 So, will you accept?
 I can’t simply disregard it.
 What…?
 Since you-know-what is in that village.
 And it seems they’ll form a three-man team
 with Neji as the squad leader.
 But the Village Hidden in the Stars is a Shinobi village, isn’t it?
 Then they should do their own protecting
 without asking others.
 There are often instances of a small village
 with friendly relations seeking cooperation.
 In particular, that village is small
 and it seems there aren’t that many Shinobi.
 No kidding. But why’s a place like that being targeted?
 Actually…!
 It all happened 200 years ago.
 A star fell in the village!
 Those stars like in the sky, not ninja stars or something?!
 Right! It seems there’s a mysterious power in the star
 that has an effect on Chakra!
 That’s a superstition!
 In the first place, no way has a star ever come falling down!
 It’s true!
 It’s actually been targeted several times until now
 by Shinobi of other lands.
 By Shinobi of other lands?
 Mysterious power, huh?
 Indeed, it does seem that someone like Orochimaru would target it…
 All right, I guess I’ll be participating in this one too!
 What?! But the three-man team’s already been determined.
 I’ve got an ace up my sleeve…
 Amaguriama Sweet Shop
 Listen up. I’ll take the lead from here.
 There’s danger before entering the village.
 Okay, got it!
 Hi, guys!
 I’ll go on ahead and be waiting!
 Naruto! Hold it!
 That idiot!
 Umm, what’s Naruto doing in a place like this?
 Like I know.
 Lady Tsunade, there was a report
 that Naruto has joined up with Neji’s squad.
 Yes. I added him to the Village Hidden in the Stars mission.
 Why…?!
 Those four proved themselves in the Katabami Gold Mine…
 and things will quiet down in the village here, too.
 You’d change an already determined three-man squad just for that reason?!
 Lady Tsunade?!
 Rare Roasted Chestnut Bean Jelly with gold leaf candy from Amaguriama?
 Could it be that was from Naruto…? 70.01	01:06:50:29	01:06:52:26	Tea! Hurry!
 Mizura!
 You okay?!
 I’m fine…
 I told you not to push yourself!
 But, I don’t want to fall behind everyone’s training…
 What’re you doing during your training?!
 Mizura suddenly keeled over in pain…
 Take him to the medical treatment room.
 Yes sir.
 I’ll go, too.
 Hokuto by herself is enough for an escort.
 Sumaru, you have a mission.
 All right! I’m here first!
 Once I cross this valley, I’ll be in the Land of Bears.
 The Village Hidden in the Stars is close.
 Wha--?!
 You little…!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku…
 Protection!
 This guy blocked Kunai knives with Chakra!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Cut!
 Damn it!
 Incredible Chakra!
 Wait!
 This guy’s an enemy… He suddenly attacked!
 You’re Leaf Shinobi, right?
 Are you from the Village Hidden in the Stars?
 I’m Sumaru. I came to pick you guys up.
 Then why did you do such a thing…?
 Look at that.
 Huh?
 The border of the Land of Bears is constantly filled with poison gas.
 It’s also serves as a natural fortress
 against invasion from other lands.
 So this is the danger you were talking about, huh?
 Isn’t that great, Naruto? You owe Sumaru your life!
 It’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship
 between the Leaf and the Hidden Star Village.
 Give me a break.
 Was it none of my concern?
 I could have just watched and not done anything…
 I am Akahoshi
 and I serve as the deputy Hoshikage of the Village Hidden in the Stars.
 Deputy…Hoshikage?
 Due to the sudden passing of the Third Hoshikage one year ago,
 presently there is no Hoshikage in this village…
 But, I heard the only ones who can refer to themselves as a Kage
 are the leaders of the Five Great Hidden Villages…
 That doesn’t make any difference!
 We are not inferior to you guys!
 Even if we’re small now, this village will someday rival
 the Hidden Villages of the Five Great Nations!
 At that time, I’ll become the true Hoshikage!
 Silence!
 Go back to the training ground.
 H-Hey, wait up!
 Oh! Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Now of all times!
 Don’t worry about him. Please continue your story.
 Forgive me.
 As  you say, the Shinobi in our village are not qualified
 to refer to themselves as a Kage.
 However, in this village, there is the star
 that all the Kage in the Five Great Hidden Villages also envy.
 We will use the power of the star and someday,
 this can become a village which can claim the Sixth Kage title.
 So that star is being targeted, right?
 Yes. Our search team obtained some information.
 Where’d that guy go?
 Hey!
 I finally caught up. Was your name Omaru?
 Not Omaru, Sumaru.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 But Sumaru’s sure an interesting name.
 It’s another name for the star cluster Pleiades or Spring Star.
 Everyone in this village has a name associated with stars.
 After all, this is a village where a star fell.
 I see…
 What’re you trying to elicit from me?
 What? Nothing in particular.
 I hadn’t thanked you for earlier, so.
 I can tell even if you give me the runaround…
 The people from other lands are all after the star.
 If you have that power,
 you can stand above all of the Hidden Villages, so…
 Is your awesome Chakra also the power of the star?
 If they had that star,
 would everyone have the same Chakra as you?
 No! The more tremendous the power,
 the more hard work is required to control it!
 I’ll work hard, work hard, work hard!
 I’ll become the Hoshikage!
 Yeah! I look forward to working with you at that time!
 Huh…?
 I’m also going to become the Hokage someday, believe it!
 You’re a strange guy.
 Really?
 Intruder!
 Protect the star!
 But they really are collapsed entirely from the center towards the outside.
 When a star explodes in mid-air, it seems they collapse like this.
 That’s the training area where the star is enshrined.
 Hurry up and show me the star.
 No. People from other lands aren't allowed beyond this spot.
 But the star is over there, right?
 I can’t protect it if I can’t get close to it!
 It’s not like we trust you guys.
 Geez, you’re such a suspicious guy!
 Why can’t you trust us who came here on a mission?!
 This is my personality, you see.
 It can’t be?! No way.
 I’ll chase him down!
 You go to your friends in the training area.
 Hurry!
 Right. Okay.
 Hokuto!
 Sumaru… I’m sorry.
 We couldn’t protect the star…
 You little!
 It’s ridiculous to do something like steal in someone else’s village
 in broad daylight, you little thief!
 Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Now, I won’t let you getaway!
 Ninja Art: Kujaku…
 This Chakra?!
 Beast!
 Uh, oh! Move away!
 Fire the Everywhere Shuriken Jutsu towards that monster!
 It’s futile!
 This is my real target!
 I found your weak point.
 The main body doesn’t move while controlling the Chakra!
 Let’s go! Clone Body Slam!
 There are more ways to use my Chakra!
 That one hit hard.
 Synthesis!
 Damn…
 Naruto!
 Wings!
 You can fly?!
 You let him get away.
 I’m sorry. But…
 It was my mistake for leaving it to you.
 But as for him, he used the same Ninja Art as you.
 What’s the meaning of this?!
 Only those who perform the star training
 can use that Ninja Art…
 Then you’re saying he’s someone from this village?
 I don’t know…
 I’m the one who let him get away.
 I’ll get the star back, no matter what!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 I’m kind of bothered by the village leader’s attitude.
 That the opponent used the Ninja Art: Kujaku means…
 Yeah, the attacker is definitely a Shinobi from this village.
 But, that old man didn’t say anything.
 It looks like there’s some kind of secret.
 We need to investigate him. Let’s all split up.
 Roger!
 I’ll get that star back, no matter what.

139,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 You're an embarrassment to our village.
 Why do you think we came all the way here to Leaf Village?
 P-Please listen to me, Gaara.
 T-They lashed out first…
 Shut up!
 I'll kill you.
 U-Understood, I was wrong.
 I-I'm sorry… I'm really sorry.
 I'm sorry about that…
 This guy…has a nasty look.
 To think he was able to hit that Kankuro
 with a tiny rock with great ease.
 This guy's…good.
 Let's go.
 We didn't come here to play around.
 I know.
 Hold it!
 What is it?
 Judging from your headbands,
 you're Ninjas from the Village Hidden in the Sand, right?
 Without question, the Land of Fire and the Land of Wind are allied nations.
 But the arbitrary coming and going of Shinobi
 is supposed to be prohibited by the treaty.
 State your purpose!
 Depending on circumstances…
 Hmph! So this is what they mean
 by the darkest place being under the candlestick.
 Don't you know anything about it?
 My permit!
 As you say, we're Sand Village Genins from the Land of Wind.
 We came to this village to take the Chunin Exam.
 Chunin Exam…?
 Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals
 What is the Chunin Exam anyways?
 You really don't know anything, do you?
 Bro, if you pass the exam, you can become a Chunin from a Genin!
 I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!
 Heh!
 Hey! You there…
 What's your name?
 Huh?  M-Me?
 No! The gourd next to you!
 I'm Gaara of the desert…
 I have an interest in you as well…
 What's your name?
 Sasuke Uchiha.
 Say! Say! What about me? What about me?
 Not interested.
 Heh! Things have gotten interesting.
 Konohamaru, do I look weak?
 Compared to Sasuke, yes...
 Sasuke, I won't lose to you!
 What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?!
 What do you think?
 I don't think they're anything special.
 But the black-haired one from Leaf Village and the gourd from the Sand Village…
 those two need to be checked.
 Now then, in conjunction with beginning the Chunin Exam,
 let us first have those in charge of the rookie Genin come forward.
 Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma…
 So?  Are there any Genin from your squads
 you wish to recommend for these exams?
 It goes without saying,
 but if it's a Genin who has carried out eight or more formal missions,
 you can recommend them for the exams if you wish.
 Well, as a general rule,
 having carried out more than twice that amount of missions is appropriate.
 There's no need to hear this…
 It's too soon for them.
 Then, you first Kakashi.
 The Kakashi-led Group Seven...
 Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki. Sakura Haruno.
 I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these three for the Chunin Exam.
 Huh?
 The Kurenai-led Group Eight...
 Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka, Shino Aburame.
 These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi, recommend the same.
 The Asuma-led Group Ten...
 Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi.
 These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi, recommend the same.
 All three recommended…
 To think rookies will be in the Chunin Exam…
 Hasn't it been five years since that's happened?
 Hmm…
 Wait a minute!
 What is it, Iruka?
 Lord Hokage, please let me say one thing.
 This may be presumptuous,
 but as for the nine names that were given,
 I was in charge of them at the Academy.
 Admittedly, they were all students with ability,
 but it's too soon…!
 They should be tested after having gained more experience!
 I became a Chunin when I was six years younger than Naruto is now.
 Naruto is different from you!
 Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!
 They always do nothing but complain about important missions…
 Teaching them a lesson once would be fun.
 Trying to crush them would be interesting, too.
 W-What did you say?!
 Well, joking aside…
 Iruka Sensei...
 I understand what you want to say.
 It's aggravating, I know. However…
 Kakashi...
 Don't do it.
 Stay out of this! They're not your students anymore!
 Now they're my subordinates!
 Man…troublesome people.
 B-But the Chunin Exam is also known as…
 Iruka…
 I understand your point.
 Master Hokage...
 Therefore, I have decided to conduct
 a special preliminary exam for these rookie Genins.
 P-Preliminary exam…?!
 Say! Say! Say!
 Why is it that he's the one who always calls us out,
 and then makes us wait?!
 That's right! That's right!
 What's he going to do about the feelings of a maiden
 who accidentally overslept and resigned herself to no blow-drying?!
 I overslept, so I haven't washed my face and didn't brush my teeth.
 Y-You…That's dirty.
 Why're these guys so hyper first thing in the morning?!
 Hey, good morning, folks!
 Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life…
 Right! That's a lie!!
 Uh, well…
 This is sudden, but I recommended you guys for the Chunin Exam, so…
 Here, these are your applications.
 Chunin Exam…
 That being said, the recommendations are not compulsory.
 You guys are free to decide whether you take the Exam or not.
 All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!
 Hey, cut it out. Get away already…
 Only those who want to take the Exam, sign that application and
 come to Room 301 of the Academy at 3:00 p.m. five days from now…
 That's it!
 Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!
 Chunin Exams, eh…
 I bet lots of strong guys would be there…
 For example, that guy!
 And this guy!
 Okaaay! I won't lose to anybody no matter what!
 If I take the first place, the path to the Hokage is right there!
 Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto will be the Hokage…
 I'll just retire my elderly self at once.
 Yaaaay!
 I might be able to fight him.
 I...don't want to…
 Here I can't…
 keep up with Sasuke, and not even with Naruto…
 The Chunin Exam, no way…
 Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!
 Sure. I don't have any missions today, so I'll play with you guys!
 Yaaay!
 Oh!
 Leader! Konohamaru!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?!
 Hey, you! Let Moegi go!
 Darn! Let's follow them, Konohamaru!
 Y-Yeah!
 W-Wait!
 Chunin Exams, eh…
 Yo.
 S-Sasuke, what's up?
 How about we go for a little walk?
 No way! For real?!
 Well well... So you can keep up at this speed, eh?
 Wait for me! Moegi!
 Bro, where'd you go?
 I think we are lost.
 Nooo! Let me go!
 Even the strongly fortified Village Hidden in the Leaf…
 is mine if I slip in the middle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.
 Hmm?
 That was fast…
 Hey! You fat old man!
 What're you going to do with Moegi?
 What am I going to do, you ask?
 You want to know?
 Wha--?!
 Don't move!
 If you do, the brat's dead meat!
 Y-You. Why're you doing this?!
 I want the first Hokage's Scroll of Sealing!
 If you bring it to me, I'll return the brat!
 Scroll of Sealing…
 Umm…
 Sasuke…
 What's up, all of a sudden?
 Sakura…
 Give up on the Chunin Exam… lt's too early for you.
 Is it…?
 I thought so…
 The Chunin Exam is a gathering of top dogs…
 You might die if you're not careful…
 Sasuke…
 So you're worried about me, right?
 Yeah…kind of…
 What a display of affection, eh?
 Get lost! If you don't want to die.
 Don't talk as if you know everything!
 Don't make me angry!
 Sasuke!
 Don't take me lightly!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke?
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!!
 What're you doing?
 Hurry up and bring me the Scroll of Sealing!
 What'll happen…if I say, heck no?
 You don't care what happens to this brat?
 Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens to that bunch of straw, I say.
 Wha--?! When did he do that?!
 I've taken Moegi back from you, thank you!
 As expected great leader! Moegi respects you.
 Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh…?
 You don't know when to give up!
 Naruto!
 Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru, I was scared.
 Oh, there-there…
 Leader, did you catch him?
 Yup, as you can see!
 Huh?  What?!
 Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!
 Dang it! When did he switch?!
 I see…
 If you don't want to turn out like this,
 you'll give up on the Chunin Exam, too.
 Sasuke, don't die…!
 Big mistake if you think I'd say that.
 I was aware of this Genjutsu right from the start!
 What?!
 The real Sasuke wouldn't do something like
 invite me to go for a walk!
 Don't make me say such frustrating things!
 That kind of elementary Genjutsu won't work on me!
 Did you say elementary…?
 That's right!
 Incidentally, I've seen through that you're also an illusion
 and aren't really here!
 I don't know about…
 that!
 See?
 Just what I'd expect of Kakashi's subordinate.
 However, this will become reality in the Chunin Exam!
 I wonder if you can endure that…?
 I'm not scared! I'll take them on anytime!
 The Chunin Exam isn't... The Chunin Exam isn't…!
 I'm still not sure if I can do it…
 That was a stupid thing to do…
 How was it?
 We went to the trouble of having a special preliminary exam,
 but all nine of the rookies passed.
 As you say, it appears their skills have definitely improved.
 Well, the actual Chunin Exam won't just end at this, but...
 Hey, have you heard?
 Rookies are going to be in the Chunin Exam
 for the first time in five years.
 No way.
 It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills or something anyway.
 No…
 The story is that three among them are that Kakashi's unit.
 That's interesting…
 Well, be that as it may…
 That's a sad story…
 Sakura, you're late!
 Yeah…sorry…
 Morning, Sasuke.
 Yeah…
 Something's strange about Sakura.
 So, are you sure you're going to attempt taking
 the Chunin Exam with that skill?
 May it'd be best if you runts quit.
 You're green-assed brats, after all.
 Please let us through.
 That's…mean…
 What did you say?!
 Listen! We're being nice to you!
 The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.
 Many times have we seen people quit Shinobi
 as well as people who were disabled for life
 just because they took this Exam.
 Also, a Chunin is at the level of a unit leader.
 Mission failures, death of subordinates,
 it's all part of the responsibilities of a leader!
 A brat such as this a Chunin?
 What's so bad about weeding out those who won't pass anyway?!
 A just argument.
 However, you will let me through.
 And could you also immediately undo this barrier created with Genjutsu?
 I have business on the third floor.
 What's this guy talking about…?
 I don't know…
 – Well, well… – So you noticed, eh?
 How about it, Sakura?
 You should've been the first one to realize it.
 Huh…?
 Your analytical strength and Genjutsu know-how
 has improved the most in our squad, so...
 Sasuke…
 Thank you…
 Of course. I realized it ages ago!
 You see, this is the second floor!
 Yup!
 Well, not bad… But all you've done is to catch on.
 Right?!
 H-He's fast!
 This person…
 He's a different person from when he was getting punched before!
 He stopped my kick…
 What's with that Chakra in his arm?
 Hey, this isn't what you promised.
 You were the one who said
 you didn't want to carelessly attract attention and be watched.
 But…
 Oh boy… 					This again…
 This guy…
 The marks where he was hit are disappearing.
 Was he faking?
 My name's Rock Lee. Your name's Sakura, right…?
 Huh?
 Please go out with me! I'll protect you until I die!
 Absolutely…not.
 Huh?
 You're... too intense.
 Hey, you there.
 Identify yourself.
 Dang it! Again?
 It's always about Sasuke!
 When asking someone his name, give your own name first.
 You're... a rookie, right? How old are you?
 I'm not obliged to answer.
 What…?
 Cute.
 Too intense, huh…
 Uninterested, huh…
 Now then! Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
 So those are Kakashi and Guy's treasured brats.
 Well, for the time being, their applications will pass.
 Yeah…
 It appears this year's test-takers will be amusing…
 For us proctors too, eh.
 Good grief…
 This Chunin Exam… is full of monsters.
 Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes and bushy eyebrows.
 Oh! It's you!
 You're the overly intense guy who just got rejected by Sakura.
 What's with your bizarre green jumpsuit?
 What? You want to challenge me, bushy-browed bumpkin?
 I'll teach you that it's a million years too soon to be doing that.

 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.

 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I 'll go too.
 I promised Hinata that I would definitely protect you, Princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought with the second Janin and got hurt badly…
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then why do you concern yourselves with me…?
 I…
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that,
 they probably won’t chase us all the way there!
 Forecast: Death! Cloudy with Chance of Sun!
 Too bad, but you guys won’t be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!
 Wh-Why is he floating in the air?
 Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like you can’t even imagine my Jutsu.
 Take this!
 Naruto!
 I’m okay.
 But what just flew at me?
 Don’t waste your time fighting me.
 I have already captured all three of your friends.
 What?
 Just hand over the girl.
 If you do that I’ll spare your friends.
 Choji and Hinata…
 So, what are you going to do kid?
 Naruto… Are you going to abandon me too?
 Oh no, this princess is telling you to save her,
 and let your friends die.
 Well, I don’t mind that kind of thinking since it’s the same as mine.
 Same as yours?
 That’s right.
 If someone is useful,
 then you should make use of them
 even though they may be your siblings.
 There is one thing I need to thank you guys for.
 Thank us? 					For what?!
 For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.
 I was going to put an end to them myself sooner or later anyways.
 What…?!
 It was clear that they would soon tell me,
 “Big Brother, give us the property and the money too.”
 Three feudal lords are not necessary in one country.
 And you still call yourselves brothers?!
 It doesn’t matter.
 Even though it’s my parents or my brothers.
 I'll make use of anything I can.
 Now, give her to me.
 I refuse.
 I see.
 Naruto…
 A person who would abandon his siblings
 would never keep his promise with me.
 Well, that’s true.
 It’s impossible, Naruto!
 You don’t even know what kind of Jutsu it is!
 That doesn’t matter!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Take this!
 What is this guy?
 There’s something hard around his body that I can’t see…
 Naruto!
 I'm sorry, but none of your Ninjutsu work on me.
 Not even one.
 Damn it!
 What?!
 What is that?
 Crystallized ice…?
 I can gather water vapor in the air
 and instantly turn it into crystallized ice.
 So the things that just attacked me were ice Shuriken.
 Man! It’s hard to see if it’s transparent ice.
 Just that is not too interesting.
 What is this great sense of danger?
 I’m sure his Jutsu has already started!
 Where is it, where is it coming from?!
 Kid, do you know today's weather forecast?
 Weather forecast?
 Cloudy and partly sunny.
 It’s a good weather for you to die.
 What is this?
 What?!
 Look out!
 Damn it!
 Naruto!
 That’s a lens!
 Lens?!
 Yup, I turned the crystallized ice into lens
 to gather the sunlight and shoot it.
 So, I can’t really control it, but it’ll be an instant when you die.
 As soon as the battle condition at the Land of Green is prepared,
 I’ll burn up the surrounding countries with this Jutsu.
 This way!
 It’s no use.
 I could even see things that are a thousand miles away.
 I found you.
 Naruto… Why do you protect me?
 I wonder why…
 I don’t know either.
 Naruto…
 Haruna!
 While I distract him, run!
 Don’t even think you guys could get away from my Jutsu
 by doing that!
 You decided to hand me over the princess?
 Who would hand over Haruna to the likes of you!
 What a fool.
 I’m telling you that if you hand me the selfish princess
 and just go back to the village, I’ll let your friends go.
 I promised with Hinata that I will save Haruna!
 Just to keep a promise with your friend,
 you’re gonna risk your life to fight in a hopeless battle, huh…?
 You’re just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 You’re just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 This is what the feudal lord foolishly said
 to us who were trying to take over the Land of Green:
 “Please do not torment the people in this country.”
 I beg you!
 I don’t care what happens to me,
 but please promise me one thing!
 This is a small weak country surrounded by big countries.
 Without the powers of the people, the country cannot prosper!
 In order for the country to prosper,
 we must take care of each individual people
 and not sacrifice a single life!
 I want you to consider the people as a family
 and not torment them.
 I am the feudal lord!
 It doesn’t matter what I do to the people, right?
 That’s why…
 That's why this country has been at peace until now!
 Peace doesn’t matter to me.
 All I need to do is use the people as the stepping stones
 and feather my nest!
 And because of that kind of good nature,
 his daughter was taken as a hostage!
 What do you mean?!
 It seems like it was ten years ago.
 A lot of the people were sacrificed by the pressure of the big country…
 Riots occurred in the country and the country came close to corruption.
 It was a bitter decision…
 I had no choice but to let my daughter,
 who is more important than my life, taken as a hostage.
 I know that Haruna will not forgive me…
 A cold-hearted father who sacrificed his own daughter
 just for the peace of the country.
 Why don’t you ask your daughter directly?!
 In the after life!
 My father was…killed!
 What an outrageously good-natured person, huh?
 You’re wrong, he was a great feudal lord!
 Naruto…
 Listen!
 There are two kinds of human beings in this world.
 Those who use others, and those who get used!
 In my case, I will get to the top using anyone,
 whether it’s my parents or my friends.
 You! I’ll never forgive you!
 Shut up!
 D-Damn…!
 Die!
 Naruto…
 You can’t move anymore?!
 You’re not the one…
 It was because of Haruna’s father that this country was peaceful…
 The person who is going to succeed this country is…
 The person is…
 Haruna!
 Stop!
 Stupid!
 Why aren’t you running away?!
 Kill me! If you kill me, your goal will be fulfilled, right?!
 Naruto, Naruto has nothing to do with this!
 So both the parent and daughter are naïve, after all.
 Why not complain to your father in the afterlife
 for making you sacrifice your life for the country?
 How scary…
 Y-You!
 It’s time for you to die, kid.
 I’m not a kid!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m not going to hand over the Land of Green
 to a person like you!
 Naruto!
 Die!
 What?!
 No…way…
 But kid, it’s too late even though you took me down…
 The Land of Green without a feudal lord will collapse
 due to the war between the large countries over its territory.
 It’s too bad, but that’s not gonna happen!
 Shizune!
 It’s a pain, but we came to get you guys!
 Shikamaru!
 But…I didn’t ask you guys to come get us!
 But you look pretty beaten up.
 No no, this is…
 Naruto!
 Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!
 Everyone was safe!
 Yeah.
 We were rescued by the people of Leaf Village.
 Huh? Oh yeah, why are you guys here?
 We received notice of a coup in the Land of Green
 and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me to come…
 Princess Haruna’s father was very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.
 My father…?
 Please forgive us, when we arrived, your father was already…
 I see…I’ve caused so much trouble for you.
 Damn!
 The position of the feudal lord that I finally got a hold of…
 But, then the surrounding countries are not going to stay quiet.
 It’s okay.
 An announcement has been sent out to the neighboring countries
 in the name of the next feudal lord.
 Under your name, Princess Haruna.
 Then we don’t need to worry about the country getting attacked anymore!
 Haruna!
 Haruna…
 Do it.
 You want to take revenge with your own hands, right?
 I’ll do the same if I were you.
 I am…not like you!
 Haruna…
 Kikunojou, please forgive me.
 Princess Haruna.
 Here, Kikunojou could look over the Land of Green.
 I'm sure that Kikunojou will watch over everyone forever.
 Well, Lady Haruna, we are leaving now.
 Thank you, Naruto, Choji, and Hinata.
 Shizune, I’d like to ask a special favor.
 What is it, Princess Haruna?
 My role is to take over my father’s will to protect the peace of Land of Green.
 In order to do that,
 I want to borrow some help from the Leaf Village.
 Our help?
 Yes.
 I want you to lend me Naruto.
 Huh?!
 Please, Naruto.
 Princess Haruna.
 I want you to help me with the revival of the Land of Green.
 I…I…
 I’m sorry, but I can’t really do that.
 I need to go back to my friends.
 And I need to do more training and become much stronger.
 There are things that I must do.
 It’s all for my precious friends!
 Then I can’t take you away from them…
 Naruto, I’ll promise that I will do my best to keep my father’s wishes
 and strive for a peaceful country where no one will be sacrificed.
 Yeah!
 It’s a promise!
 Thank you! Naruto!
 Good-bye! Everybody!
 We’ll come back someday!
 Bye!
 See ya!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 No! He’s looking over here!
 Of course, he’ll look! Stop complaining and attack him!
 No, no, it’s impossible!
 He just moved right now! He moved, Naruto!
 Of course, he’ll move! Hey, approach him more!
 No, no, no. This is my limit.
 Come on, just give him a one good hit!
 No, the enemy is that thing you know?
 A monster, a monster!
 This wouldn’t be a mission!
 Next time: “Ino Screams! Chubby Paradise!”

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with  you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Not yet? Idate hasn’t come, yet?
 My lord, we finally found evidence
 regarding the matter we were investigating.
 Oh, I see.
 Mm, good work.
 My lord, is there something amiss?
 No, it’s nothing.
 Concentrate on my Chakra.
 We’re saved.
 Sasuke, are you okay?
 Naruto, I’m counting on you.
 Protect Idate.
 The Last Leg: A Final Act of Desperation
 Poison needles won’t work on me.
 How dare you do that to Sasuke and Sakura?!
 Rest easy.
 I’ll send you to the place where they are real soon.
 I won’t go so easily!
 Naruto.
 But what do I do?
 The Rasengan won’t work on his sword.
 It doesn’t matter.
 Those two are waiting for my help!
 Saving each other again, huh?!
 They wouldn’t survive falling off this cliff.
 Shut up!
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Oh…you’re going to run away from here using such a diversion?
 Don’t mess with me! Who’s going to run away?
 Naruto, it’s futile. That technique won’t work on that sword!
 It’s futile!
 Naruto!
 Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,
 why is it that each and every Leaf Village Ninja is an idiot?
 Shut up!
 I’m going to save those two!
 Are you seriously thinking they’re alive after falling off this cliff?
 You should’ve gotten out of here.
 As if…
 I'd abandon my comrades and run away!
 That’s my answer to the tenth problem!
 What’re you saying?
 One more time.
 Eat this.
 Idiot.
 Rasengan!
 Naruto…!
 You still don’t get it?! You don’t have a chance of winning!
 Damn!
 That's…
 the damage Sasuke inflicted.
 That's it!
 If I aim for that…
 I can win!
 You saying you still want to fight? Give it up, already!
 Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke gave me a chance! I won't waste it!
 Naruto…
 Stay still!
 Sasuke! They’re using the Water Clone Jutsu!
 I know!
 Trust us, Idate! We’ll protect you, no matter what!
 S-Sakura…
 Go on ahead. We’ll be right behind you.
 Sakura!
 I…
 I hate people who don’t know when to quit.
 This is the end.
 A foolish cheap trick.
 What?!
 I’m saying I can’t stand this saving each other business.
 Idate!
 Your opponent is over here!
 Above!
 Rasengan!
 What?!
 It can’t be!
 Naruto, you did it!
 Naruto…
 You’re really something.
 Yeah, well…
 Sakura!
 Naruto…! Idate…!
 Sakura!
 She’s okay?
 Sasuke’s okay, too.
 I’m coming to save you now, believe it.
 Idiot. Forget about us and get going to the finish line, quick!
 Oh, that’s right.
 But what should we do about this?
 Leave it to me.
 We’ll cut the rope and go to the opposite bank in one swing!
 I get it!
 I thought the worst of myself.
 But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.
 I trust you more than anyone.
 It was the first time I was trusted by someone.
 So I wanted to win this race for the boss, no matter what.
 But in reality, I can’t win just with such feelings.
 So many times along the way, I felt like giving up.
 Watch out!
 But each time,
 you guys risked your lives to save a lame duck like me!
 Naruto, I’m sorry.
 I should’ve trusted you guys from the start.
 What’re you saying?
 Say stuff like that after winning the race.
 You’re right.
 Naruto!
 Idate!
 Okay, do it!
 Right!
 Boo! Boo! Boo!
 Now that's a rousing welcome.
 Naruto, at this rate, we’ll crash into the rocks!
 I know. Leave it to me!
 Release Chakra from the bottom of my feet.
 It’s the very last Chakra!
 Then stick to the rocks with Chakra!
 All right, Naruto!
 Now dash to the finish line!
 Sakura, I’ll come back to help you right away!
 Okay. Let’s go, Idate.
 Right!
 Run steady, Fukusuke!
 Stay sharp until the end.
 Shut up! I know.
 Geez…spoiling my good mood.
 I can see the Todoroki Great Shrine.
 Boss!
 Blast it!
 Good, good.
 Idate.
 – Hey! 					– Oh!
 Hey! What’s that?
 Here he comes!
 Idate of the Wasabi Family’s here!
 Go!
 You can still catch up!
 What?!
 Idate!
 Idiot!
 What’re you doing, Fukusuke?! Run!
 Damn it!
 I won’t lose.
 I will not lose!
 I won’t give up until the very end!
 Like heck. I won’t be passed up after I've come this far!
 – All right! – He caught up.
 Blast this guy…!
 I won’t lose, you little…!
 Blast…
 Idate…!
 Come on, Idate!
 Boss!
 Go! Idate…!
 All right!
 I did it!
 Idate.
 You ran a fine race.
 Boss!
 You did well.
 Boss, I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry.
 You fool. What’re you apologizing for?
 You won.
 No, please let me speak.
 I really want to apologize now. I’m truly sorry!
 You're making no sense to me. What a totally weird guy.
 Well done, Idate.
 I was wrong about you.
 Okay, Idate. Go receive the winner’s blessing.
 Yes!
 Hey, Idate!
 Hey, you idiot!
 Bringing shame upon the boss! You’re prepared, aren’t you?
 I-I’m sorry!
 The winner!
 Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!
 He finally did it.
 Hey, hey… Just a minute.
 Kyuroku.
 Along the way, he rode on the back of a hired Ninja.
 This is a violation.
 W-What?
 There’s proof.
 Look at this photo.
 Racing until the end on your own strength is the rule of this race.
 Therefore, Idate is disqualified.
 The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuya of the Wagarashi Family.
 No way.
 H-Hold it. That was…!
 I’ll hear no excuses! Jirocho, it’s a promise.
 I order the Wasabi Family dissolved immediately.
 Just a minute.
 There is no such rule anywhere. Do not speak nonsense!
 M-My lord!
 Or perhaps…
 you have a reason for wanting the Wagarashi to win at all cost?
 No, nothing like that.
 Could it be because you would not be able to do things like this?
 Look.
 You fool! Retire and enter the monastery!
 Yes, yes, my lord!
 Kyuroku Wagarashi.
 Y-Yes?
 Word of your evil deeds has reached my ears as well.
 Your sins against the people of Degarashi Port are severe.
 Therefore, the Wagarashi Family is to be dissolved as of today.
 Understood?
 Y-Yes, sire.
 Today is an auspicious day.
 With this, the matter is settled.
 Thanks for the help, Naruto.
 Idate, this is good-bye, huh?
 I’ve come to get the wounded.
 Ibiki.
 B-Big Brother!
 Where are the wounded?
 Over here.
 Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.
 R-Right.
 Um, excuse me.
 What is it?
 N-Nothing.
 Brother!
 Wait, Big Brother!
 Who are you?
 The man who called me Big Brother died three years ago.
 Big Brother… I figured out the answer to the tenth problem!
 I’ll never betray a comrade again!
 I can trust others now!
 He's looking good now.
 'Bye, Idate. Let’s meet again.
 Good-bye. See you around.
 Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?
 I wish you good health, Boss!
 Yeah…
 See ya!
 Take care!
 An interesting guy as always.
 No wonder the Fifth Hokage sees potential in him.
 Naruto! Thanks!
 Idate! Next time, it’ll be a battle with me, believe it.
 Sasuke, does it hurt?
 No.
 Thank goodness.
 Those wounds will heal immediately once we get back to the village.
 Right.
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor of the village’s honorable Uchiha Clan…
 is just a good-for-nothing kid…
 I couldn’t beat him!
 And yet, he…
 that Naruto...!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Hey Sasuke and Naruto, what's happened to both of you?
 This is a hospital, and Sasuke's still recuperating!
 Even you should know better, Naruto.
 Stop the antics already!
 Why, why's this happening?!

 Did you take care of the business?
 Yes…
 More importantly, the rain’s starting to let up.
 Shouldn’t you quickly put an end to this farce of a race?
 Fine.
 Guess I’ll go for a run!
 A-Above here, huh?
 Yeah…
 It’s a quite a long staircase, believe it.
 They’re also called the Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.
 Heh, cool!
 Let’s go at a sprint!
 Hey, he’s kidding, right?
 What kind of stamina does he have?
 Boss.
 It seems Idate is heading this way!
 He hasn’t run away, just like you said, Boss.
 Of course…
 I saw potential in him.
 Now, it’s just a little more! Run Idate!
 A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder
 Hey…you…!
 Huh?
 Let me tell you…
 It’s not like I trust you or anything yet, okay?
 Yeah, yeah whatever.
 It doesn’t really matter to me, believe it.
 There’s a person who still trusts you, right?!
 During the Chunin Exam…
 Huh?
 You said that a tenth problem appeared, right?
 Yeah. It was a weird problem to determine whether you’d take the problem or not.
 Three years ago…
 I got a similar problem…
 Okay, now I’m going to give the tenth problem.
 The tenth problem…
 What kind of problem is Big Brother going to give?!
 The tenth problem is a battle
 with the Three-Man Squad you were teamed up with.
 The three of you will compete against each other this exercise.
 And among you… one of you will be failed!
 And the one who is failed will remain a Genin for life
 and we will never again let them take the Chunin Exam!
 N-No way…
 Then for what purpose were we together until now?
 I make the rules here.
 Back-talk is not allowed at all!
 If you want to withdraw, you should do so.
 Withdrawing here and waiting half a year is also a way.
 If one person among the three withdraws,
 of course all three members will be disqualified.
 But you will be allowed to take the Chunin Exam
 one more time, in half a year.
 So, what will you do?
 One comrade will be dropped.
 I have the confidence to pass.
 But, one of them will remain a Genin for life.
 It’s a choice between comrades and your life.
 If you’re going to quit, now’s the time.
 Is there nobody else who’s going to withdraw?
 We’re good, then.
 Okay, to everyone who has remained here…
 I render you disqualified!
 Wh-Why…?
 H-Hold on a minute!
 I prepared myself and remained here!
 Such preparedness is below contempt!
 Scums like you don’t have the qualifications to become Chunin!
 That’s all!
 I see…
 What kind of a test was it for you guys?
 I forgot…
 I mean, it was explained to me, but I didn’t really get it.
 Trusting in my big brother’s words, I remained in the classroom.
 And yet I was failed!
 No way could I take that. I questioned my big brother.
 Big Brother! What’s up with that test?!
 A Shinobi reads the double bluff.
 You should’ve understood that was the test.
 Even so, I can’t accept that!
 No matter how dangerous,
 isn’t it necessary to have the courage to plunge into any mission?!
 Idate.
 Can you really not accept it?
 Of course not, such a…
 You…quit as a Ninja.
 If you’re telling me to quit, then I will.
 But tell me why I’m no good!
 That’s something you should realize yourself,
 with your own power.
 To this day…I don’t understand the answer to that.
 So after that, you were deceived by Aoi, huh?
 Yeah, that’s right.
 We made it…to the top!
 I’m going by myself from here. You rest!
 Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!
 I can’t be asking you guys to help any more.
 There’s no point if I don’t win by myself, on my own strength!
 Oh…hey! Idate!
 I can make it! It seems Sakura’s special medicine has worked!
 Blast!
 This doesn’t hurt!
 I’m back in the game… from here!
 If we cross this suspension bridge, it’s Ouzu Island, huh?
 We should hurry.
 It seems Idate has made it to the Modoroki Shrine.
 What?!
 It seems we underestimated the Leaf Genin a bit…
 You jerk! You didn’t finish them?!
 Now’s not the time to be talking about stuff like that.
 Please cross the bridge quickly!
 Useless Ninja!
 Hey! I’m only helping you because it’s the job.
 I’ll waste you if you keep talking smart to me.
 I-I’m sorry…
 If you’ve understood, then get a move on!
 Y-Yes!
 There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!
 This is quite something.
 I never thought you’d make it this far.
 That’s the… Blade of the Thunder God!
 Stop!
 Stop!
 Stop kicking a dead horse.
 Nobody is a match for the legendary Blade of the Thunder God,
 said to have been used by the Second Hokage.
 You should know this well.
 After all, you’re the man who stole this for me.
 Blast…
 Mud balls, huh? lt’s just like a kid’s fight.
 Sorry, I didn’t have any Kunai Knives.
 Naruto…
 But you won’t be able to dodge the next ball just with that.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 He’s concentrating the Chakra in his palm.
 Here I come!
 Here I come!
 Once more!
 I don’t know what you intend to do, but…
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Too bad.
 This Blade of the Thunder God cuts through anything!
 Even Chakra itself is no exception.
 Naruto!
 I have to make doubly sure
 so that nothing troublesome will happen again.
 I’m your opponent! Keep your hands off Idate!
 Humph, are you still saying such things?
 Saving each other, protecting each other, trusting each other.
 It ticks me off!
 The weak can't survive if they don’t support each other.
 So they trust people easily and are betrayed.
 Weaklings like you guys should just run about and away.
 Right, Idate?
 It was like that also when you stole
 this Blade of the Thunder God, right?
 I can see it. That’s the Village Hidden in the Rain.
 Aoi Sensei?!
 Aoi Sensei!
 Idate…
 B-Big Brother…
 You idiot!
 Go back to the village immediately and surrender yourself!
 You?!
 Do you know what you have done?
 What?!
 Strict as always, eh? And he’s your cute little brother.
 But it’s truly perfect that you’ve shown up here.
 Aoi Sensei…
 This forbidden Jutsu scroll can’t be deciphered
 unless you’re Jonin class.
 I’ll have the brothers betray the Leaf Village together.
 Ibiki, please decipher it already.
 I refuse.
 So are you choosing death, together with Idate?
 Such as he is, he’s also a Shinobi.
 He’s not afraid of death.
 It doesn’t seem so.
 This face is one taut with fear.
 I’m quitting as a Ninja! So please don’t kill me!
 Please decipher it.
 You don’t want to see your cute little brother killed
 before your eyes, do you?
 Little brother, you say?
 That fool?
 Big Brother…
 Such a threat means nothing to me.
 Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hidden in the Leaves that important?
 Even if you protect it at the risk of your own life,
 you’re nothing but a pawn!
 So that’s why you became a traitor?
 You’re a pathetic man!
 You punk!
 Idate!
 You, run away!
 What about you, Big Brother?
 I’ll go, after I clean up the mess here!
 I don’t think so!
 Big Brother!
 Go, quickly!
 But Big Brother…!
 Go! Having you stay is a burden!
 I won’t let you!
 Go!
 So appalling…
 that he’d risk his life for such an idiotic guy.
 All you could do after that was run.
 You could’ve returned to the village and called for help.
 But you didn’t do that.
 Thinking Ibiki was dead was no excuse!
 The fact is, he was alive…
 In that regard, lbiki was admirable.
 Not only did he completely endure repeated interrogation,
 but he also retrieved the Forbidden Jutsu scroll...
 without having confessed to anything!
 And to think that he did all this
 for his good-for-nothing little brother.
 You betrayed your village, abandoned your older brother,
 and came to think of only yourself.
 Even Ibiki who is blood-related and risked his life to save you,
 you didn’t trust him!
 Afraid of being accused,
 you didn’t trust the Village Hidden in the Leaves, your birthplace…
 You trust nobody.
 You’re not trusted by anyone.
 For me, there is no pupil as excellent as you.
 As a reward, I’ll let you die in one instant.
 Idate!
 Sasuke…Sakura!
 Rest, Naruto!
 I’ll beat this guy!
 Don’t be acting cool, believe it.
 You can’t beat me, no matter how many people show up.
 Me, Aoi Rokusho,
 the Rain Jonin who possesses the Blade of the Thunder God.
 Is that so?
 Interesting.
 The Blade of the Thunder God and my Chidori!
 Let’s test which is better!
 The rumors were true.
 The survivor of the village’s honorable Uchiha Clan…
 is just a good-for-nothing kid…
 Sasuke!
 Run, Sakura!
 He’ll show no mercy, no matter who the person is.
 Everyone will be killed!
 No way!
 Huh?!
 We’ll protect you, no matter what.
 We promised that, didn’t we?!
 Trust us!
 Now all that’s left is the wounded rabbit
 and the excellent pupil, huh?
 You two together, go to the next world.
 Take it back!
 Take it back!
 What’re you talking about?
 What you said…
 earlier!
 Don't mess…
 with the Uchiha… 276	02:10:08:14	02:10:10:02 with me!
 Why you--!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke! Get up!
 How very cold the bottom of the ocean must be.
 Stop!
 Idate!
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 What the heck should we do?
 That sword of the Second Hokage won't budge an inch
 even with Sasuke's Chidori or my Rasengan!
 But I can't lose this battle.
 I won't run away, no matter what!
 If my techniques aren't going to work, I'll just have to keep trying!

 Sasuke…?
 No… Who is he?
 He's got the same Sharingan as Sasuke.
 Really…
 who’d believe a kid like you to have the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.
 Why does that guy know about the Nine-Tailed Fox?!
 Naruto, you will come with us.
 Roar, Chidori! Brother vs. Brother!
 That guy is…close by!
 That guy!
 Elder Brother…
 Today…
 when school’s over, help me train for a Shuriken Jutsu…
 I’m busy… Have father teach you.
 But you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu, Elder Brother…
 Even I can see that.
 You always treat me like a pest, Elder Brother.
 Ouch!
 Forgive me Sasuke… Some other time, okay?
 I don’t have time to pay attention to you today.
 You’re always jabbing my forehead and saying ""Forgive me, Sasuke.""
 You also say ""not today,"" but there's never a day.
 Father.
 Huh?
 Why doesn’t Elder Brother pay any attention to me?
 That guy’s a little strange…
 He’s the type that doesn’t really like to become intimate with people.
 Why?
 I don’t know.
 I am his father and still I can’t read that boy…
 Here!
 Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!
 If you’re worried about doing Shuriken Jutsu practice,
 I will watch you when you get home.
 They’re not practices, they’re training!
 See you later!
 Sasuke, are you on your way to school?
 Yes.
 I saw Itachi earlier on. He’s really become a man.
 He’s already a top-notch Shinobi.
 He graduated at the head of his class at the Academy at the age of seven,
 and attained Chunin level at the age of ten, didn’t he?
 He became adept at using Sharingan at the age of eight.
 Yes, I remember.
 That boy is truly the pride of the Uchiha clan.
 By the way, how old are you now, Sasuke?
 I’m the same age as when Elder Brother graduated,
 but I can’t…
 What’s the matter?
 Hey!
 Stop talking nonsense!
 Oh my, dear.
 Sasuke, both you and Itachi come from the same Uchiha clan,
 the pedigree of the Hidden Leaf Village.
 Have confidence!
 You’ll be an amazing Shinobi just like Itachi one day.
 Yeah!
 See you later!
 Do your best!
 Study hard!
 That’s right…
 I come from the same Uchiha clan as Elder Brother…
 I won’t lose to Elder Brother!
 I’m pretty late…
 What was that?
 I had the feeling there was someone there…
 The lights are out. Even though it’s not time for bed…
 What’s this?!
 W-What’s this?!
 What in the world is this?!
 Uncle… Auntie…
 Father… Mother…!
 Father? Mother?
 Aren’t you here?
 There’s somebody here!
 Move!
 Move!
 Move!
 Father! Mother!
 Elder Brother!
 Elder Brother! Father and Mother are…!
 Why? For what reason?!
 Who in the world would do something like this…?
 Elder Brother… What are you…?
 What are you doing, Elder Brother!
 Foolish little brother…
 Mangekyo Sharingan!
 My legs…!
 Stop!
 Elder Brother!
 Don’t make me see this!
 Why…?
 Why did you, Elder Brother…?!
 No…!
 No…
 Auntie! Uncle!
 Father! Mother!
 Stop it! Elder Brother!
 Don’t kill Father and Mother!
 W-Why…
 Why did you…? Elder Brother…?
 To measure my abilities…
 Measure your abilities…? Just for that?
 Are you saying that…
 Just for that… you killed them all?
 That is of great importance.
 What do you mean…?
 Don’t talk rubbish!
 I’m scared…
 I’m scared!
 Don’t kill me…!
 D-Don’t kill me!
 You are not even worth killing…
 Foolish little brother…
 If you want to kill me, begrudge me! Hate me!
 And keep on surviving in that unsightly manner…
 Just continue fleeing and fleeing and hang onto your life!
 Shall we go outside…?
 These guys aren’t just anybody…
 Itachi, it’ll be a pain in the neck if this kid moves around and…
 Maybe I better chop off a leg just in case…
 W-What did he say?!
 Now then…
 Long time no see…
 Sasuke.
 Itachi Uchiha!
 Itachi…Uchiha?
 The same as Sasuke… An Uchiha…
 Huh…Sharingan…
 And moreover, he resembles you a lot…
 Who the heck is he?
 He’s my younger brother.
 But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan had been murdered.
 By you.
 Itachi Uchiha…I will kill you!
 I must kill one certain man without fail!
 That man…
 My elder brother…
 I thought I couldn’t die… without killing him, but…
 That’s the guy that Sasuke was saying …
 The man he wanted to kill…
 It’s just as you said…
 I held a grudge against you and hated you.
 For the singular purpose of killing you, I…
 I…
 have lived my life!
 Sasuke…!
 Chidori…?
 I will kill you!
 Die!
 W-What’s going on?!
 I can’t believe that Sasuke’s Jutsu was so easily thwarted…
 This doesn’t look good!
 I’ve got to do something!
 Chakra permeates the air…
 I see…
 So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way!
 Sasuke!
 Darn it!
 Ninja Art: Summo…
 You’re too slow!
 Huh…? I can’t feel the Chakra…
 Darn! Darn! Why is it?!
 My sword Shark Skin has the ability to…
 cut through and eat Chakra!
 It’s a pain in the butt
 if the kid moves around and uses Jutsu like that…
 Before these legs…
 Should I chop off these arms?
 Why doesn’t it emerge?!
 It’s pointless…
 What?
 You guys just don’t know me much, do you?
 This man Jiraiya does not fall victim to any woman’s allurement,
 but rather his forte is winning women’s affection!
 I’m not made to blindly follow after a woman’s feminine charm!
 When you get to my level,
 women yelp with delight at my sex appeal!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools\
 Watch out, Sasuke!
 Naruto, don’t help him.
 But…Sasuke is!
 It is your duty to watch through this battle, Naruto.
 What?!
 This is his fight…
 This represents everything that he has been carrying up to now.

144,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Stop that!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting! Naruto Uzumaki has just arrived!
 I’m not handing Gantetsu over to you, no matter what!
 That’s…
 It can’t be…!
 To Each His Own Path
 You… You mean you ripped through my net?!
 I can cut through a weak flimsy net like that with a single bite!
 It’s useless! You won’t be able to tear through my Mesh Cage!
 I’m gonna have Gantetsu back!
 I’m telling you, it’s useless!
 Damn it! I can’t get this thing off!
 Here, just die already!
 –Naruto! 					–Naruto!
 You’re mine!
 Too bad!
 So it’s you who’s gonna die, after all!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Go!
 This is the end for you!
 What’s that?!
 Shura, on the scene!
 The kid! The kid inside that net knows where the treasure is!
 Good job, Monju!
 Akio!
 Akio…?!
 –Akio! Bro! 					–Akio! Bro!
 Thank you.
 Gantetsu…
 I heard you say the name Akio, just now…
 Who in the world is that kid?
 That kid… Akio…
 He’s your… He’s your little brother.
 Th-That’s a lie!
 My younger brother… My younger brother has…
 In those flames…
 Akio…
 You…killed him…!
 No!
 Gantetsu hasn’t killed anybody!
 He rescued us! He rescued Akio!
 Five years ago.
 I had developed a distate for the Ninja Dropout’s way…
 I found myself carrying Akio…
 Akio!
 Elder brother!
 No! You’ll inhale smoke!
 Damn it!
 I thought I could change a little if I could only save that child.
 But that’s not what happened!
 I just continued to create victims like Akio.
 So that’s why I started planning what’s happening right now
 in order to exterminate the Ninja Dropouts.
 So that’s what happened…
 –Gantetsu! –Gantetsu, are you all right?
 You’re not hurt, are you?
 I’m glad you’re ok.
 They are children from the houses that the Ninja Dropouts attacked…
 Using the money Gantetsu poached from the gang,
 Akio, the oldest, has been taking care of them.
 Gantetsu is just like the central figure of a family.
 I can’t believe this…
 You mean that…the kid who was there just now was…
 Akio!!
 Where are you going…Gantetsu?!
 To the Ninja Dropouts' hideout.
 I’m gonna get…Akio back!
 I will get Akio back! Your only job is to guide me there!
 Don’t interfere!
 Todoroki, I understand how you feel.
 However, Gantetsu saved Akio and all these other kids
 from the Ninja Dropouts!
 Besides, there’s something you should do before that!
 Don’t mess around with me!
 Even so, this guy…Gantetsu… is a member of the Ninja Dropouts.
 The Ninja Dropouts killed my parents!
 You’re absolutely right.
 My own crime will never be washed away.
 As soon as I get Akio back… you can…do whatever you like to me!
 I’m going, too!
 Me, too!
 Then, Sakura, please look after the children!
 Leave it to me!
 Todoroki…
 I’ve continued hating that guy for five years…
 What am I supposed to do now…?
 Damn it!
 In any case, we’ve got to take care of your little brother right now!
 I know that!
 This time for sure… I’ll rescue Akio!
 Where did you stash our treasure?!
 Where’s your hideout?!
 Come on! Talk!
 I’ll never…tell you!
 You little brat!
 That’s the Ninja Dropouts’ hideout…
 That residence belongs to Shura, the leader.
 I’m pretty sure that’s where Akio will be.
 Akio…
 Oh! Hey! Todoroki! Wait!
 Damn!
 This ain’t good! They’ll detect us!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Let me handle this situation!
 I leave it to you, Bushy-Brows.
 Akio!
 This way.
 I’m pretty sure that Akio is being tortured in the basement…
 That guy was once a Ninja.
 There’s no telling what he’ll try to do.
 I’ll go first.
 Akio!
 W-Wait!
 Akio…!
 Gantetsu…!
 You jerk…!
 Don’t come over here!
 Gantetsu!
 Akio!
 Hey! Gantetsu!
 So only one animal got caught in the net, huh…?
 Shura!
 He’s one stubborn brat. He never unsealed his lips.
 I’ll use another method to get back the treasure.
 After I’ve killed the lot of you!
 Naruto, pursue Shura!
 We’ll be fine! Iron bars like this are nothing!
 Got it!
 Todoroki, I’m leaving this in your hands!
 Farewell.
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 Todoroki, you take care of Akio!
 Todoroki!
 Blood Rain!
 I won’t forgive you… no matter what!
 Rasengan!
 So that’s what happened…
 Gantetsu… that’s how you protected Akio…
 Yet I… I…!
 Gantetsu! Give me Akio!
 Elder brother… you came to rescue me, after all…
 Hang in there, Akio!
 My elder brother… Todoroki, it's really you, isn't it?
 This spells the end of the Ninja Dropout.
 Yeah…
 That’s right.
 But where is Naruto?
 Hey!
 Naruto Uzumaki! On the scene…!
 Naruto! Lee!
 Akio!
 Akio’s back!
 It’s Akio…!
 Are you all right, Akio?!
 Yeah…
 Oh my gosh, you’re hurt!
 I’m fine. It’s nothing!
 Sakura, could you take care of his wound?
 Leave it to me.
 Take care of him.
 Apologies for the inconvenience… Let’s head to the capital.
 I just cannot forgive you.
 But it is true that you rescued Akio.
 The Ninja Dropouts have been annihilated.
 Gantetsu got caught up and died in the fighting
 that ensued while being escorted.
 Elder brother…
 Todoroki…
 Yeah! Great! That's great!
 You’re gonna stay here, right?
 Huh?
 You’re gonna stay here with Gantetsu and the other children, right?
 I haven’t been a good brother…
 But you are an irreplaceable elder brother for those children.
 Elder brother…
 What's this…?
 This is the souvenir that
 I didn’t have a chance to give you back then.
 Elder brother… Thank you.
 Let’s go! Ninja!
 Okay!
 –Good bye! 					–Good bye!
 –Take care, everyone!
 –See you!
 –Bye! 					–See you!
 Hey… How are we gonna get out of this forest…
 without Gantetsu?!
 We can’t go back now!
 We took this path earlier on too, didn’t we…?
 I’m starving…
 I can’t go on.
 Hey! Somebody rescue us!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Naruto, what on earth were you thinking?
 What? I only brought an injured person to the hospital.
 But to bring an outsider into the village…
 But I’m sure he is not a bad guy at all.
 I understand your feelings, but he has amnesia.
 There is a possibility that he’s an enemy spy.
 Please, Grandma.
 I’ll make an exception, just this one time.
 But you will be his keeper, and will be held accountable for all his actions.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it

 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 The waves of pain are coming faster...
 Sasuke, you should quit the preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got worked over by that Orochimaru guy!
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think it’d be so soon…?!
 I couldn’t ask for more.
 For the 1st battle,
 Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.
 No objections, right?
 - Right! -No!
 The pain won’t go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 Don’t use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark on your neck gets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will be called off at that time.
 I’ll be coming in to stop it, so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thing is responding to my Chakra.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,
 not to mention the Sharingan!
 However… Yoroi’s ability is the worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 You… my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Bushy-Brow's Jealousy - Lions Barrage Unleashed!
 You… my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Yes…Yoroi has unorthodox ability to absorb Chakra.
 It’s a magnificent art that absorbs spiritual and physical energy
 simply by holding his palm against an opponent’s body.
 And, if all of your Chakra is absorbed, Sasuke,
 you’ll be forced to rely upon the power of my Curse Mark…
 Now, release that luscious power…!
 That is the only way you have to survive.
 You…little!
 To think you still have strength left…
 Though you’re just a guinea pig.
 That was a close one…
 Put your mind at ease… I’ll end this right away!
 What’s the matter, what’s the matter?!
 You already finished?!
 His aim is one, close-quarter fight.
 What should I do!?
 At this rate, things will go downhill…
 Sasuke Uchiha… ls this the best you can do?
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 You call yourself an Uchiha with that?
 Don’t be looking so lame!
 Give your best!
 That guy…
 That’s it!
 Oh!
 You can’t afford to be inattentive!
 I’ll finish you with this!
 Is this as far as it goes…?
 He…vanished?!
 That’s my…!
 What?!
 Huh?
 But then…from here on is my original.
 It’s over…
 The Dancing Leaf Shadow…?!
 Eat this!
 Dang it…! lt’s responding every time…
 Please…!
 I’m begging you…
 Stop!
 You! Sasuke! Don’t be looking so lame!
 To think they’d be worried about me…
 Is this it…?
 I won’t be swallowed up… by this thing...
 No way!
 The Curse Mark receded!?
 Here I go!
 You’re weak!
 You’re weak.
 I’m not done, yet!
 Lions Barrage!
 There’s no need to check.
 I’m stopping the match from going any further…
 Therefore, the winner of the first battle, Sasuke Uchiha…
 passes the preliminaries!
 Yes!
 Well. Good job…
 Before that Lions Barrage,
 your movements were that of Guy’s Taijutsu…
 So you copied it with the Sharingan
 when you wrangled that one time with that Lee kid?
 Sasuke! You, you…
 won in a lame way!
 Look at you, all battered up! You idiot!
 Man, that loser…
 Sasuke…Thank goodness.
 Okay, I’ll win, too!
 Lee… Because of you,  I’ve managed to save my neck.
 Things would’ve gotten hairy
 if I hadn’t seen your technique in close-quarters combat.
 But it doesn’t appear to be a technique that I can use heavily.
 I see… So before, he copied a part of the technique I only used once?
 Sharingan!
 That’s your ability…
 Sasuke… you’re quite a person.
 You get rapidly stronger…
 I kind of…feel a bit of fear.
 For a sequence of high-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,
 it’s impossible to acquire this without training
 that whittles away flesh and blood.
 No matter how much you use the Sharingan,
 it can’t just be mastered in a short space of time…
 Moreover, his idea for that finishing move…
 Kakashi… this boy reminds me of when you were a kid…
 Last year’s number one rookie was Neji Hyuga.
 This year’s number one rookie is Sasuke Uchiha.
 I wonder which one is stronger…?
 Really, he’s something else.
 To think he’d develop the true power of the Sharingan in situation like this…
 What’s most to be feared… is the Uchiha ability?
 That was surprising…
 To think he brought the Curse Mark that was getting out of control
 into submission with his will…
 Tsk. Again?
 It just make it more interesting!
 Yeah! He is Sasuke after all…
 This is as far as we’ll go…
 I’m hungry…
 W-Wow!
 Nothing special.
 Magnificent…
 Sasuke Uchiha...
 We medics will give you the best of treatment.
 You guys are out of your territory.
 Huh?!
 I’ll take him under my care…
 Now, I’ll take you into the back…
 and seal the Curse Mark.
 Can we wait until the preliminaries are over?!
 I want to watch the matches of those who will remain in the main battle.
 No!
 Don’t get so heated.
 If we let things be any further,
 the situation might become irrevocable.
 I won’t accommodate you anymore.
 Now then, come on…
 Sasuke…
 Hm?
 Sakura... Speaking of which, during the match…
 did you see something that looked like a strange wound on Sasuke’s neck?
 What?
 Please promise me…
 Don’t say anything about this bruise to Naruto.
 What?
 Listen… this is also teamwork.
 It won’t do to have him unnecessarily worried.
 I-I don’t know either.
 I see…
 Umm, now then…
 We will get right to it and begin the second match.
 Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame
 Which weakling is it?!
 Both of you, come forward.
 We will now begin the second match.
 That’s the Sound Ninja…
 The guy who had both his arms broken by Sasuke!
 It seems like you’re proud of your arms…
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 He’s going to fight with those arms?
 I wonder if Shino is going to be okay…
 He’s fine. He’s strong!
 What…?
 I’d square off with anybody except him…
 Now then, please begin.
 Now, Zaku…
 How you fight will be a sight to see…
 If you fight here, you’ll be finished…
 Withdraw!
 Somehow, this one still works, so…
 One arm is enough to take care of you!
 You can’t beat me with just one arm.
 Stop pestering me!
 Take this!
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 Okay.
 Hang in there. lt’ll be over right away.
 Curse Sealing!
 Next time, even if that Curse Mark starts kicking in again…
 the power of this Curse Sealing should suppress it.
 However, this Sealing Jutsu makes the strength of your will its foundation.
 If something happens like you not believing in your own strength
 and that will were to weaken…
 the Curse Mark will once again start to rage.
 Out of character.
 It appears he’s quite tired…
 To think you’ve become able to handle Sealing Jutsu…
 You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?
 You…
 Long time no see, Kakashi.
 Orochimaru…
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 This is surprising.
 I never thought you’d appear.
 Why are you after Sasuke? What’s your purpose?!
 Even though you’re one of the legendary three Ninja,
 I must not retreat.
 I’ll stop you here, even if it costs my life!

146,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 For a Friend!
 What did you say?!
 You mean to say that only rookies went after Sasuke?!
 It really couldn’t be helped…
 the situation in the Village being how it is…
 And anyway…
 I’ve taken the minimally required measures.
 Hey, hey!
 Your mission has already been assigned!
 Uh, I’m gonna go do an errand and will be back shortly…
 Don't worry.
 Geez…
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 It’s already been two days since Sasuke left the village…
 And Naruto and the others who went in pursuit haven’t come back either.
 And neither has Lee…
 I know. I’ve more or less heard the whole story.
 I…believe in Naruto!
 I believe him, but if something were to happen to Naruto and Sasuke…
 Sakura, you don’t need to worry about anything.
 Leave this to me.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 First of all, I want you guys to fan out in all directions
 in pursuit of Naruto and Sasuke’s scent.
 Naruto and Sasuke you said?
 Did something happen to the two of them?
 I’ll explain later… Right now, time is of essence.
 Okay.
 As soon as you confirm that you’ve detected the scent,
 call me and I’ll be there immediately.
 All right! Scatter!
 Well, I guess since she saw them fight before her very eyes…
 it’s useless to tell her not to worry.
 Stop!
 Damn…
 I can’t stop…
 Sasuke… Stop with revenge.
 What?!
 Even if you were successful in carrying out your revenge,
 all that will come out of it is a sense of emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?!
 Don’t say that so knowingly!
 Well…calm down.
 Neither you nor I could call ourselves lucky.
 Of that much I'm certain.
 But it could be worse.
 Both you and I have found precious comrades, right?
 We understand that all the more because we’ve lost them once.
 I taught you Chidori
 because you now have precious people.
 That power isn’t something to be used against your comrades or for revenge.
 You know what that power should be used for.
 I’m gonna win no matter what!
 Don’t get so carried away!
 I was too naïve…
 Watching them, they might actually be intent on killing each other…
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Please let me get there in time!
 I already said this earlier but…
 In truth, you were waiting for this too, weren’t you?
 Neither Kakashi nor Sakura are present right now.
 So there’s nobody here to stop us like that time before.
 You…!
 This time around we’re gonna settle this for real!
 I will take you down!
 Chidori!
 You idiot…
 Same here! I’m gonna clobber you…
 and take you back home even if I have to drag you!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 It wasn’t meaningless…
 To me, you became my closest friend.
 Sasuke actually came out and said that…to me…
 And that’s exactly the reason why I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.
 Damn…
 Damn you!
 Damn…
 He was able to counter
 my full power of Chidori to that extent…
 That jutsu…
 Damn…
 Naruto, to what extent…!
 That loser…
 Naruto…!
 Well, your limit is two blows… that’s about it.
 And if I try to use more than that…
 what will happen?
 The third blow won’t initiate.
 Remember that well.
 If you try to initiate the Jutsu forcibly…
 not only will the Art not initiate properly,
 but your Chakra will become zero…
 In the worst case scenario it will cost you your life!
 Damn… I can’t waste a blow…
 It wouldn’t serve any purpose if we cancel each other like earlier.
 There’s…no longer any mistake about this.
 You…really intended…
 You really intended to…
 Sasuke…!
 I will use numerous speedy techniques and Jutsu to create an opening.
 And then…I will make a hit with Chidori.
 Sasuke…
 Did you know, Naruto…
 Top-class Ninja should be able to read each other‘s hearts
 simply by an exchange of fists.
 Even without saying anything…
 You’re naïve, Naruto.
 How about it?
 Were you really able to read inside…
 this heart of mine?
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Sasuke… I knew that you were always alone.
 At first, I was relieved when I found out
 that there was a guy similar to myself.
 And it also made me happy…
 To tell the truth, I really wanted to approach you right away.
 But…I wasn’t able to approach you…
 – Awesome… – You’re incredible…
 You were always able to do everything.
 And moreover, you were always being praised by everyone.
 Because you and I were so different…
 Because I didn’t want to admit it, I decided to call you my rival.
 I didn’t want to lose to you…
 and I felt that even more strongly…
 because I was called a loser.
 Even when we were in the Squad Seven,
 I continued to feel the same way the whole time.
 I’m stubborn…
 And wasn’t able to express what I really felt…
 What I really wanted was to become like you.
 You were what I aspired to…so…
 You are one of the ones I want to fight.
 I was really happy when you said that!
 Those were your first words… acknowledging me…
 You and I both knew,
 without us even having to have an exchange of fists!
 From that time on…
 Even without saying anything…
 The fact that…
 we are friends!
 It’s not without meaning…
 To me you’re…
 my closest friend.
 However…you’re trying to take me down for real.
 Right now, I don’t really know
 whether you really meant what you said earlier or not.
 Thinking that we were friends…
 That might have been…
 That might have been just me…
 It’s too late now!
 Naruto!
 If that’s the case…I’m…
 really lame, aren’t I…
 Sasuke!
 But…
 It can’t be helped, can it?
 I don’t know why but…
 I don’t know why…
 But I…
 I…
 don't want you…
 you to be taken away by someone like Orochimaru!
 You managed to divert it with your left hand,
 but it was meaningless.
 You won't be able to use any hand sign
 or that Jutsu earlier anymore.
 This is the end!
 Wh-What’s…
 that red Chakra…?
 Where does he get that kind of power from?!
 W-What the heck…is this?!
 His shoulder injury is healing…
 That’s unbelievable!
 Sasuke! I’m not gonna let Orochimaru take you away!
 I will stop you,
 even if I have to break every bone in your arms and legs!
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 Don’t you talk stupid like that!
 I don’t care what you’re thinking anymore!
 I won’t let you go to Orochimaru’s place no matter what!
 I’m taking you back to the village even if I have to drag you there!
 Sasuke! You’re my…

147,"Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Stop!
 D-Don’t push my father around!
 You idiot, Fuki. Get out of here!
 What’re you hesitating for? Take care of him quickly.
 That’s your job, right?
 Get out of my way.
 Fuki!
 You’ve got something nice there.
 I’ll take that.
 Please spare my daughter!
 Like I care!
 Father…
 Father! Father!
 Stop it!
 Y-You jerk.
 Here.
 It’s okay.
 Look out!
 Just a little more… Just a little more, believe it.
 Rare menma pickled bamboo shoots?
 Right. But only if I can get my hands on it when it’s in rare bamboo state.
 It seems the rare bamboo only grows on some ungodly cliff…
 Then I’ll get it, no matter what.
 And then I’ll eat some Ichiraku ramen with the rare pickled bamboo shoots on top…
 No matter what, believe it!
 Rare pickled bamboo shoots.
 I did it!
 I’m saved.
 Huh?
 What is that?
 It’s a person!
 Vanished Memories
 To think there’d be thunder even though it’s not raining…
 It’s kind of eerie.
 You shouldn’t shout like that…
 This is a hospital.
 You made me shout.
 Huh? That white coat.
 Could it be that you’re helping out the Medical Team, Sakura?
 Isn’t it lovely? I finally got the white coat.
 I see. It’s great that you were here just at the right time.
 I’ve got someone I’d like you to take a look at.
 Someone you want me to take a look at?
 It’s him.
 Wh-What? Could that be Dozaemon…?
 His name’s Dozaemon, huh…?
 I didn’t think he was your acquaintance Sakura.
 No. Dozaemon is a drowned body…
 Oh, never mind…
 I thought I knew him, but I was mistaken.
 I see. Then I leave him to you.
 Hey, this is a Leaf hospital.
 So people outside of the village can’t be admitted.
 Come on, just do this for me.
 I’ve got other business to attend to. So I leave the rest to you.
 Oh, hey, Naruto! Hold it!
 This is indeed the rare bamboo I’ve heard about.
 Yeah, now I can eat the rare ramen!
 What’re you talking about?
 It takes three or four weeks to make
 the pickled bamboo shoots out of the rare bamboo.
 What?!
 First, I boil this and then ferment it slowly.
 What, I can’t eat it right away?!
 You need a degree of determination to eat delicious things.
 Naruto, so this is where you were.
 Hey, what’s up with you?
 What’s up, nothing, you jerk…
 Oww!
 So you force a strange patient on me
 and intend to eat ramen by yourself at your leisure?
 Ouch. That hurts.
 Back to the Past Jutsu!
 Oh, what’s he doing there?
 He’s probing into his memory from his subconscious.
 That reverse hypnosis thing, huh?
 Right.
 Have you remembered anything?
 I see.
 It seems he’s lost his memory.
 Lost his memory?
 Let’s call it a day. We’ll do more tomorrow.
 It seems he doesn’t remember anything.
 Not his name or address…
 If none the doctor’s Jutsu don’t work, then this is the real deal.
 Then, doesn’t he have something we could use to identify him?
 Nope… This is all he had.
 What’s this?
 It’s a dove flute, also called an ocarina.
 Ocarina?
 It’s broken, though.
 Oh, it looks like this will stick.
 Not having memory could also be a temporary state of shock…
 Anyway, you sign this.
 What’s this?
 A letter of undertaking.
 I told you earlier, but this is a Leaf hospital.
 Outsiders aren’t allowed.
 If something were to happen,
 you will take responsibility for everything, Naruto.
 What?!
 You got a problem?
 Fine, okay.
 I sure picked up something troublesome.
 What’s going on?!
 That’s in the direction of the hospital!
 Everyone, it’ll be okay. Please evacuate calmly.
 Help me!
 Forgive me… Forgive me.
 Is there anyone left?
 Anyone here?
 Sakura, did you evacuate everyone?
 I’m checking right now.
 Hey, Sakura!
 Naruto.
 Everything okay?
 Somehow.
 Hey, where is that guy?
 What?
 Come to think of it…
 He’s not here.
 Please help! My baby is… My baby is still inside!
 What did you say?!
 No way. It doesn’t look like we can get in with these flames…
 What’re you doing?! Hurry up and put out the fire!
 I’ll go in!
 That’s reckless.
 The baby is in the deepest part of the hospital.
 What?
 It’s the sound of a flute.
 It's him!
 He’s getting closer.
 Here he comes!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – This way! 					– To the right.
 He did it! The baby is with him, too!
 All right!
 My boy!
 That was a close shave.
 Thank goodness!
 Thank you very much…Thank you!
 Sure.
 Thank you so much.
 An outsider with amnesia, huh?
 Good grief. What a dilemma.
 It’d be okay just to let that one guy stay, right?
 We can’t do that.
 For the safety of the village,
 we must not overlook even the slightest thing.
 But, we figured out that
 he’s not a bad guy after that incident, right?
 Unfortunately, we must not let someone whose identity we don’t know
 stay in the village.
 Then, if he were to do something,
 I’ll take the responsibility and figure something out.
 Sakura, how’s he doing? Has he remembered anything?
 No, nothing yet.
 I see.
 I’m begging you. I’ll let you guys have some of
 the rare pickled bamboo shoot ramen too, Grandma.
 Rare…pickled bamboo shoots?
 Yeah. I went to pick some on the way back from a mission
 and then found him--!
 That’s news to me.
 So you were loitering around like that on your way back from a mission?
 Ouch. Oww.
 Naruto, so you’re serious about looking after that boy, huh?
 Yeah, it’s true.
 All right, then I’ll let that boy remain in the village.
 Lady Tsunade!
 I can’t run out the person who saved a child from this village.
 Excellent, Grandma. Now you’re talking!
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki… Nice to know you.
 I-I’m…
 Oh, that’s right. Your memory hasn’t come back yet.
 Then, hmmm.
 Menma, make it Menma.
 Menma?
 Yeah. I’d gone to pick some and then I found you, so…
 Menma…
 Okay, got it. My name’s Menma.
 It’s settled. Nice to meet you, Menma.
 Good to meet you, Naruto.
 Here you go.
 Wow, it looks delicious.
 The ramen here is the best in the world, believe it.
 Let’s eat.
 Tasty.
 But this isn’t the finished product. Don’t you notice something lacking?
 Huh?
 Oh.
 Come to think of it, there isn’t any menma pickled bamboo shoots on top.
 Right. Until the rare pickled bamboo shoots are ready,
 they’re sealed from your ramen.
 Hey, old man, you’ll be sure to make it, right?
 Absolutely.
 I can’t wait. Say, Menma.
 Let’s definitely come here together to have some at that time.
 Right.
 Okay, come on in.
 Excuse me for barging in.
 As of today, this is your home.
 It’s a dirty place, but make yourself comfortable.
 Whoa.
 It really is dirty.
 Don’t get so hung up on the details.
 Y-You’re right.
 More importantly, let’s get to sleep and
 starting tomorrow we’ll come up with a way to get your memory back.
 Right.
 I can’t eat anymore…
 Man, I slept well!
 Morning, Naruto.
 Menma?
 Whoa.
 Everything’s been cleaned up nicely!
 Did you do this?
 Yeah. I couldn’t sleep and had time to kill.
 Thanks for that…
 Hey, Menma! What’re you doing?!
 What do you mean? I’m hanging up the laundry.
 Don’t wash someone else’s underwear!
 I’ll do that myself, so don’t worry about it!
 Really?
 Now then… How should we get your memory back?
 Oh, I know!
 Come with me, Menma.
 This is a specialty from the Land of Wind, Sand Dumplings.
 This fine soy powder is used to resemble sand and they taste really good.
 Yeah?
 And this one is a specialty from the Land of Earth, Stone Rice Cakes.
 The crunchy texture is irresistible.
 Uh-huh.
 And this is a specialty from the Land of Water, Mist Mitsumame Beans.
 So? Have you remembered anything?
 No… Nothing at all.
 Oh, I thought you might remember something
 if they had a specialty from your home.
 Sorry.
 No need to apologize.
 Naruto, forget about my memory.
 What?
 You see, we don’t know how or when my memory will come back.
 More importantly, you’ve got your own work, right?
 Well, you’ve got a point.
 I’ve got to finish cleaning the Great Stone Faces by today…
 Then let’s do that.
 But before that, wait just a minute.
 Huh?
 Hey, Menma.
 Ma’am…
 I’ll carry your things to your house.
 Oh, thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 No problem.
 At any rate, you’ve sure got a lot of weeds growing in your yard.
 My lower back has been bothering me lately…
 The grass grows as much as it wants.
 Then I’ll do it.
 Oh, my.
 I-I will, too!
 Thanks so much!
 Phew… Finally done!
 Naruto.
 What is it?
 They want help too!
 Huh?
 It seems this area here is all homes of the elderly.
 Thanks.
 I leave it to you.
 F-For real?
 What’s this?
 Actually, thank-you gifts have been sent to Naruto and that boy
 from all over the village.
 What’re those two doing?
 But really, you’re sure an odd guy.
 Am I?
 You’ve got a strong sense of righteousness,
 I mean, you’re the embodiment of kindness.
 It’s not something easily done.
 I just want to live right.
 I don’t want to have any more regrets.
 Hm? Menma, have you remembered something?
 Huh? No, not really.
 I see.
 What?! Is it bird poop?
 It’s blood!
 Give me a hand, Menma!
 Right!
 What’s the matter?!
 Someone…in this village…
 Let’s get out of here!
 Menma, I leave this guy to you.
 Got it.
 Damn it!
 Damn you. Come on out!
 Damn it! Where’s he hiding?
 Naruto…
 Sound of a flute? Is it Menma?!
 Huh? What’s this…?
 Awesome power’s starting to well up in my whole body.
 All right.
 Awesome!
 Power’s flowing over me!
 I see you.
 Damn it.
 I did it.
 It’s a Substitution!
 Damn it. He got away, huh…?
 You okay, Naruto?
 Menma…
 That flute just now…
 Who in the world are you?
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 As I thought, he’s no ordinary man.
 He won’t be an easy opponent to fight.
 Wait a minute.
 You are talking about Menma like his our enemy or something.
 There is that possibility, you know.
 He could be with the intruder from the other day.
 What are you talking about?
 Weren't you two gonna help us seek Menma's memory together?
 Our mission is to find out the guy's identity
 and to catch the intruder.
 Unlike you, we don't trust Menma just yet.

 They all bring back memories…
 Shall we have a reunion or something, Jiraiya?
 Fool! I summon you after a long absence
 and you make these boring jokes.
 The time to conclude this long, fateful confrontation has come.
 I'm bringing Orochimaru down, here and now!
 Hey Orochimaru…
 Why'd you have to summon me to a place like this?!
 You… I’m going to eat you up!
 Don’t say that, Lord Manda…
 You will be duly rewarded.
 Who said I'm talking to you?!
 Don’t be so flippant, brat!
 Hey, Orochimaru…
 I expect you to prepare a sacrificial offering of 100 people later.
 Though Lord Orochimaru is Manda’s master,
 if Manda learns that Lord Orochimaru can’t use Jutsu,
 Manda will no doubt double-cross him.
 Despite the fact that he had no other choice, in his condition,
 it was too risky for Lord Orochimaru to summon Manda.
 Katsuyu… take that kid to Shizune!
 Yes, ma’am.
 All right! I can fight, too!
 Shizune, please take care of this child.

 Also, the battle is going to get quite vicious from now.
 Please go far away with my clone and conceal yourself…

 You…
 I’ll hang you out until you’re dry!
 I’ve been wanting a snakeskin wallet…
 Orochimaru, you’ve sunk too deeply into vice!
 We are no longer comrades.
 Comrades?
 That word makes me shiver.

 No, that’s…

 They're Sannin, all right.

 My Chakra…
 At this rate…
 Even though you say you won’t die in battle,
 you won't have a choice if I rip your neck off…
 Right, Tsunade?
 How many minutes…
 How many seconds can I hold on…?
 I have to put it on the line!
 Fine!
 It’s about time we put an end to this!
 R-Ridiculous!
 Not done yet!
 Take this!
 Darn it…!
 Lady Tsunade… Not that…!
 She’s reached her limit…
 No…
 This guy…
 I’ve hurled him around that much, yet he’s still…
 So this is as far as you can go.
 Shut up!
 Don’t rest!
 Keep beating him.
 This is the battle…
 where I put my life on the line!
 Lord Orochimaru!
 I won’t let you go!
 You will stay with me until the end!
 Take this!
 I hit him and hit him. Something’s different…
 What is it? This…strange sense of discomfort?
 However, with this…!
 It’s over!
 He took a direct hit!
 That was it.
 Yeah…
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Putting me in this position!
 I want to eat you and kill you,
 but I can’t even chew you up with this hole in my mouth…
 Next time, if we meet again, be prepared!
 Tsunade…
 Even though you won’t heal me, I still have one way.
 A way to resurrect these arms.
 The Leaf Village… I’ll destroy it…without fail.
 At that time, it would be nice if we could meet again…
 My comrades… Tsunade and Jiraiya.
 That face…?!
 In some way or another, he took someone else’s body…?!
 No wonder, when we went at it a while ago,
 I didn’t get the same feeling from him that I did in the past…
 The true elixir of life.
 That’s my…
 my immortality!
 Some day, in the future…
 Wait!
 The bones in my ribs and feet are broken…
 The side effects of the Jutsu are starting…
 My body is…already…
 Tsunade, you haven’t changed. You’re no good at wagers.
 The Hokage is my dream!
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you have what it takes to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 It's no joke!
 If I have three days, I’ll master this Jutsu!
 Men don’t go back on their word!
 I’m the grandson of the Hokage who built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!
 You said it. Men don’t go back on their word!
 Right! I’ll become just like Grandfather. And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 I love this village and my comrades.
 So I want to protect them.
 An existence that protects everyone.
 Becoming the Hokage is my dream…
 I’d like you… to take this.
 Any time now, the side effects…
 Lady Tsunade…
 You…
 It's nothing… If I rest a bit, I’ll return to my young form.
 I’ll rest in town.
 And when Naruto wakes up, We’ll return to Konoha.
 Tsunade…
 Starting now, don’t call me Tsunade. Call me…
 The Fifth Hokage?!
 Old Lady Tsunade is the Fifth Hokage starting today…
 What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.
 After all, compared to the old man, the Third Hokage,
 there’s something…
 rough-natured and kind of selfish…
 loose with money, catty and stupid…
 Somehow, I’m going to worry if she can do it properly.
 Lady Tsunade, would you like to order something…
 Moreover, a 50-year-old lady transforming into a young lady…
 Is it okay for the person who will become Hokage
 to lie to everyone, I wonder…?
 Go outside, brat!
 It’s just like before…
 Despite how I look, I’m going to be the Fifth Hokage.
 I shouldn’t take this short brat of a foe seriously…
 This one is enough…
 Don’t call me brat!
 I may be like this now, but I’ll be Hokage some day!
 Here I go!
 Another brow flick?!
 Become a fine man…
 and, a fine Hokage.
 Yeah!
 Okay! Shall we go home?
 To our hometown the Leaf Village!
 What? I haven’t eaten yet…!
 Don’t try to distract me by laughing!
 Nawaki… Dan…
 the boy who will inherit your dreams, my beloved ones,
 is right here!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Yahoo! Here we are at a hot spring spot!
 While Pervy Sage is gawking at women, and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,
 I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!
 What?! Who worked over my room?!
 I don't know who they are,
 but I'm gonna find them and kick their butts!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Hey… Closet pervert.
 Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu…
 One Thousand Years of Death!
 He’s totally knocked out… He’s weak, sure enough.
 What’s with that big frog? What the heck are you?
 Thank you for asking me!
 Know me as the Mountain Toad… spirit sage who acquires immortality,
 also commonly called the Toad Mountain Sage.
 Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!
 M-Mountain Sage?
 Exactly.
 Hey…Pervy Sage, what’re you going to do about this?
 Here, he was supposed to watch my training.
 You did that to him.
 He interfered with my research.
 Research?
 I’m a writer. I’m writing a novel.
 This is it.
 Make-Out Paradise
 Oh, that is…!
 You know this?
 I’ve gotten quite famous.
 That’s not much of a novel!
 In the first place, what research you are talking about?
 You’re just peeking at the girls’ bath!
 – Yikes! 					– No!
 Idiot, idiot…idiot! My peeking has been found out.
 You pervert.
 F-Fool! I’m not just a pervert.
 I get inspired by peeking and can write better pieces.
 Liar! No excuses.
 More importantly, what’re you going to do about my training?
 You mean the walking-on-water technique you were doing earlier?
 You know it?
 Then take responsibility and join my training.
 Humph. I don’t care about such things.
 Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!
 Join my training, hey!
 Shut up! I hate people who don’t know how to talk properly…
 And I don’t like men.
 Oh, umm, umm…
 That Make-Out Paradise was really exciting, cool and interesting.
 The purchase or viewing of that novel is prohibited for those 18 years or younger…
 You liar.
 The reviews that I‘ve heard are great.
 It’s useless to flatter me. I’m a sage!
 I’m not the type of fool who can be coaxed by a fledgling like you.
 Oh, hey…wait!
 Farewell, kid.
 Wow! He’s cool even though he’s a pervert.
 Heeey, Pervy Sage!
 Where’d he go?
 What’re you doing, you old pervert?
 No, no, I’m sorry, miss… but what lovely breasts…
 Pervert!
 This grown-up is disgraceful.
 Maybe there’s nothing special about him, after all.
 But there’s nobody else.
 Good grief…
 As usual, the women in this village are strong-minded.
 However, that’s makes them so good.
 “As usual”? Meaning you’ve come here before?
 You.
 And you did nothing but peeping, right…?
 You Pervy Sage!
 Don’t say pervert, pervert in such a loud voice.
 Shut up!
 So I bet that one shot on the closet pervert was a fluke…
 Anyway, I’ll have you take responsibility for ruining my training! Whoa…
 Jeez, you’re a noisy brat.
 Hey!
 Be quiet inside here for awhile.
 Hey! Let me out, you jerk!
 I want to have a romantic encounter with a stacked girl.
 How dare you do that to me earlier!
 Substitution Jutsu.
 Sure enough, he’s not an ordinary old man.
 Humph! That punk…
 It’s a million years too soon for that kid to take me on.
 Not really.
 It seems you have a bit of talent.
 Then you’ll watch my training?
 Give and take!
 I'm not averse to listening to your favor
 as long as you listen to mine.
 So which is it?
 Listen up…
 Nice ripe fruit that looks like this, like this and this.
 I’ll watch your training if you bring me that.
 You really will, right?
 This Toad Mountain Sage doesn’t lie.
 Okay, wait!
 Plans are plans. They don't necessarily have to happen…
 Hello there, you ladies!
 Oh my… You’re funny, old man.
 No-no, this is the solemn truth.
 Yeah, and then, what happened then?
 Hey, Pervy Sage!
 Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.
 You fool! Who’s a Pervy Sage?
 I brought the promised item.
 Nice ripe fruit..
 Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot! That’s not IT!
 Looks good!
 Don't hesitate. Help yourself.
 Thanks.
 No!
 Where’d the ladies go?!
 I got my fill…
 Ladies…
 No doubt about it. That person is…
 Good grief. I’ve wasted time…
 Hold it! Where are you going?! What about my training?!
 I don’t care! My precious research has been ruined thanks to you.
 Research, my butt! I can’t be standing around here, either!
 I’m going to train hard, become stronger than anybody,
 pass the Chunin exam,
 and then I’ll exceed the Hokage!
 Humph! I don’t care about such things.
 Here all you do is get in my way…
 Jeez, what a repugnant brat!
 Stacked girls like the ones from earlier
 are indispensable for my great writing enterprises!
 I see… So I should bring some stacked girls, right?
 Okay.
 W-Wow…!
 If you gaze at me like that… I feel embarrassed.
 Oh…!
 What a…
 What a cute girl.
 I like you!
 You pass!
 Idiot.
 You’re really my type of girl. What’s that technique called?
 It’s called Sexy Jutsu.
 Oooh, what an idea. You’re a genius.
 I get the feeling all adults are really affected by this technique.
 Then you’ll watch my training?
 Sure! However, I have a condition.
 A condition…? What is it?
 A-Always be…in that form when you’re in front of me!
 Hey! Sure enough, you’re just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!
 No! I’m not just a pervert!
 As if you didn’t know!
 I’m a super pervert!
 Darn it… He’s gone defiant…
 Well, brushing off the stuff until now as a joke,
 I’ll watch your training.
 You mean it, right?
 A sage doesn’t go back on his word.
 Okay, kid.
 Do that training that you were doing before one more time.
 Okay!
 Okay.
 Darn it.
 Totally worthless.
 Shut up!
 It’s pointless to wear clothes.
 Hey, build up your Chakra one more time.
 One more time?
 Just do it, quick.
 You!
 What?
 You’re pretty sexy when you’re naked.
 Jeez. I’m concentrating, so don’t interfere.
 Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.
 You’re messing with my focus.
 I see…So this is The Seal Formula.
 Two Tetragram Seals making a Double Tetragram Seal…
 Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?
 Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking from between the Tetragram Seals…
 and is fixed so that it can return to this kid’s Chakra.
 Fourth Hokage…
 It’s to protect this kid, huh?
 But after that, it’s stopped with a Five-Pronged Seal…
 Putting Odd-Numbered Seal over Even-Number Seals…
 This kid’s Chakra and that of the Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled
 and are not stable.
 No wonder he is not able to build up Chakra very well.
 That tickles…old man.
 Oh, sorry, sorry.
 Perhaps someone else…did it…
 The formula is rough.
 Well, it’s probably Orochimaru.
 Kid, give me a hurrah.
 What?
 Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.
 Jeez, he’s demanding.
 Five-Pronged Seal…Release!
 What’re you doing?!
 Well, I just pushed the pressure points for relaxing.
 Just try walking on the water once more…
 Sheesh!
 What?
 I don’t know why, but it’s going well!
 Yahoo!
 I guess it’s about time to teach him how to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.
 Okay, kid. Come on out.
 I’ll teach you an ace technique.
 What, what ace technique? A deadly technique?
 There’s something you need to understand well
 before I teach you techniques.
 You probably haven’t noticed, but you possess two types of Chakra.
 Huh? Two types?
 Until now, have you ever felt a special Chakra?
 Special? Hmm…
 Come to think of it…
 Come to think of it, I get the feeling there were times when…
 Chakra suddenly sprang up and an awesome power came out.
 But…I don’t really remember those moments.
 I see.
 But I do remember sensing that it was different
 from the Chakra I always build up.
 If I liken it to colors,
 while it’s always blue…
 it felt like it was red or something.
 I see.
 Okay. That’s it for today’s training.
 What?! Already?
 What happened to the ace technique?
 I can still train.
 With training, a watched pot never boils.
 As long as we’re here, let’s have a bath…
 Not just falling in…
 Warms me up.
 A drink after training’s the best.
 Say, say, Pervy Sage.
 What kind of technique is that ace technique?
 You’ll find out tomorrow.
 Miser!
 We’ll turn into boiled frogs if we stay in here too long.
 Ebisu, sorry for snatching your student.
 It’s okay. More importantly, I was surprised…
 The Hokage has had us searching all over for you
 and we could never determine your whereabouts.
 To think you were in this village…
 The Hokage will be pleased.
 Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?
 Not yet.
 I see. That’s for the best.
 Sure enough, something about Orochimaru?
 No, unfortunately not.
 What?
 I just stopped by looking for material for my novel…
 My nature is not to get myself involved in trouble.
 What are you saying?! You should know!
 What is necessary to stop Orochimaru, known as one of the Sannin,
 the legendary three Shinobi,
 is the power of another Sannin!
 Your power, Master Jiraiya!
 First, I need to sign this contract
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 First, I need to sign this contract in blood
 and mark it with the fingerprints of one hand.
 Then I build up my Chakra.
 The Hand Signs are Dog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
 Then I must place my contract hand on the place where I want to summon it!
 How's that?!

 I’ve done it! The water is turning!
 It seems it’s going to be easier than I thought to break it.
 Then I’ll go take a little rest until it’s done…with this.
 Hey! What is that?!
 I need it to kill the time. And also to get some sleep.
 Huh! The way it’s going, it won’t even be an afternoon nap!
 Is that so…? Call me when it is broken.
 Just wait!
 If it keeps up like this, I’ll learn it within today!
 Keep on Training! Pop Goes the Water Balloon
 Oh man! Why doesn’t it break!
 Huh? Are you done with it?
 Ah…well, it’s almost done or how should I call it.
 Oh boy…
 It seems like I went beyond an afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.
 Hey, hey…how do I break it?
 Didn’t I tell you I can’t give a detailed explanation until it’s broken?
 All right, I understand…
 Naturally, you’re supposed to realize it through trial and error
 when mastering a Jutsu, but…
 Yeah, yeah.
 I guess I’ll teach you just a tiny bit on the Jutsu…
 You, try rotating the water!
 Oh, okay.
 Right or left…which direction did you imagine when you rotate it?
 Hmm…well, to the left…
 Hey, come over here.
 Okay…
 Huh, I thought so…
 W-What?
 You are in fact a right-rotation type.
 Right?
 In order to build up Chakra,
 it is necessary to blend the energy…
 Chakra 							Spiritual energy       Physical energy 		So everybody unconsciously builds up 		Chakra inside the body by rotating it. 55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20               Right                             Left 		Whether the rotation at that point 		is to the right or to the left
 differs in the individual.
 Therefore, if you imagine the rotation of the water balloon
 opposite to that of your rotation-type in this training,
 your Chakra flow divides and resists
 and the momentum of the rotation does not get on track.
 You should be able to figure that kind of stuff on your own.
 But how did you figure out that I’m a right-type so fast?
 The cowlick on your head!
 It's pretty much determined that you’re a right type if a whorl rolls to the right
 and you’re a left-type if it rolls to the left.
 It’s simple.
 Huh, so I have a right roll!
 Yes, so if you want to rotate it, you have to imagine a right rotation.
 I never really paid attention that until now…
 But this Jutsu is just the one for you.
 Hand sign is completely unnecessary. All you need is Chakra.
 There is no need to learn a finicky hand sign!
 It’s okay to be stupid!
 I’m not stupid!
 I’m the man who’s eventually going to become a Hokage!
 It’s easy once you understand!
 This Jutsu, I’ll completely master it if I got three days!
 Three days, huh?
 This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu that the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.
 Huh…?
 It took him three whole years to perfect this Jutsu…
 This Jutsu is second from the top
 on the six degrees of difficulty in mastering…
 It’s an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.
 In order to learn this move, there are three steps in the training.
 This “Water Balloon Breaking” is the first step.
 It took the genius Ninja, the Fourth Hokage…
 Three years…
 There’s no point in explaining anymore to someone
 who can’t even clear the first step.
 Do the rest by yourself!
 Take care! I’m going to return to the town.
 I have to gather some information…
 What will you do?
 A-rank in degree of difficulty in mastering…
 The Ninjutsu left behind by the Fourth Hokage…
 I’m not gonna go back yet!
 Huh…
 So long… Don’t go overboard with it.
 Now, what will happen?
 It’s something to be concerned about…
 Mister!
 Why don’t you stop by?
 This month is our special service month.
 Whoa! It’s a special service month?
 The more you visit, the more you benefit.
 Here you go, a stamp card!
 I’ll give you lots and lots of service!
 I’ll come, I’ll come!
 Hey! Come on down, Shu!
 Hey, hey, where is the toilet?
 I don’t have time to spend three years.
 All right now!
 Training, once again today! I’m gonna work hard like a blaze!
 Break! Break! Break!
 Why won’t it break?
 Little Jiraiya, you’re so naughty!
 Men are all naughty!
 Dang it!
 Three days have passed since I got the tip from that Pervy Sage…
 The rubber is stretched this much, but why won’t it break?
 What am I doing different from that Pervy Sage?
 This is great! This is so great!
 What the--?
 Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.
 I’m gonna eat now!
 Huh?
 What's the matter?
 Oh dang it!
 Darn it! Why is it like this?!
 No need to learn a finicky hand sign! lt’s okay to be stupid!
 He said that there’s no need to form a hand signal, but…
 Hey! That’s not your toy…
 This is it!
 Hurry up and wake up! Hey, you Pervy Sage!
 Uh… G-Good timing.
 Why don’t you bring me some water…
 Water?
 The first step is cleared!
 Cleared…?
 Well, let’s have you show it to me.
 All right! Watch it carefully!
 Left hand?
 Go!
 All right! See that?! See that?!
 You’re sleeping!
 Sorry, sorry.
 I’m tired from the days and nights of gathering information.
 But that seems suspicious to begin with!
 You still stink of alcohol too!
 Nevertheless…
 You rotate the water inside the water balloon that you hold in your left hand
 by repeatedly applying it with your right hand…
 It seems little strange of an idea, but…
 You’re an interesting kid.
 You understood the trick pretty well. lt’s all thanks to me, though.
 It’s thanks to this guy!
 Huh?
 I realized after I saw this cat playing with the water balloon.
 He kept on flicking it with his paw many times
 and the water inside shocked in all different kinds of direction…
 Then it came to me like “bingo!”
 How did it come like “bingo”?
 The time when the Pervy Sage first showed me breaking it…
 I remembered how the water balloon surface was not smooth.
 Until then, I was always only rotating the water
 in the one same direction…
 I realized that the Pervy Sage’s water balloon was not smooth
 because the water inside was rotating in different directions.
 And after doing it in my own way, it broke!
 It seems it’s still not possible for you
 to rotate it violently with one hand, but…
 I suppose you thought it out in your own way.
 That’s just what he expected of me!
 Anyhow… The first step is complete for now.
 All right!
 Do you want to see it one more time? One more time!
 Oww!
 You used too much Chakra and it gradually reached the point
 where there’s burden on the Chakra Network…
 But the next one won’t be like this!
 Okay. Now, we will proceed to the second step.
 Yeah!
 It seems like we can finally go into some serious training!
 – Here you go! 					– Huh?
 Rubber ball? Something like this again?!
 Now, you’ll break this one!
 It’s one hundred times harder than the water balloon!
 It’s hard…
 The first step is rotation, the second step is force.
 Since there is no water inside,
 it’s more difficult to imagine the rotation of Chakra,
 so it becomes more difficult to rotate the Chakra as well.
 That’s true…
 I’ll leave that to your own judgment.
 I need to learn a trick again to do this, don’t I?
 Well then, I’ll go gather some information.
 Hey! Wait, wait!
 Let’s train together for the first time in a while!
 I don’t mind if you take a nap.
 Don’t depend on me!
 You must have some kind of misunderstanding!
 I did say that I’ll teach you the Jutsu,
 but I don’t have the obligation to teach you every step of the way.
 If you can’t do it by yourself, then that’s it.
 Don’t be childish forever… Become more respectable like a Shinobi!
 Well, well then.
 If you can at least teach me… the trick again…
 Money!
 Money…money…money…
 W-What do you mean “be respectable like a Shinobi”?!
 Even though you say that, you’re an dirty and greedy adult!
 You’re not a respectable Shinobi at all!
 It’s way more difficult than the time with the water balloon…
 A-And…
 my hands and arms hurt.
 Dang it! How many days am I going to be doing the same thing!
 Second from the top in  the difficulty of mastering…
 Don’t depend on me!
 You must have some kind of misunderstanding!
 Dang it!
 Hey, Naruto.
 What did you come here for?
 Go buy some food from the town below.
 What?! Why me?
 Hey you…
 Even if for a while, you’re still learning the Jutsu from me.
 Here you go, thanks for waiting.
 Thank you.
 How dare he put on a master’s face only at a time like this
 when he doesn’t teach me anything…
 Dad, buy me some ice cream.
 I want this one that cracks.
 Here.
 Why? I can eat all of it by myself.
 Nope, when you get home, your mother will have supper ready.
 Okay!
 Hey…you know…
 Huh?
 Can you be around my training for just a while…today?
 I don’t have time for that.
 I have to immediately go to town.
 Unless you think for yourself and get a grip of the trick for yourself,
 it’ll never work.
 I thought I told you three weeks ago!
 Don’t be spoiled like a kid. You are a Ninja.
 I know that without your telling me!
 Just thought I'd ask.
 Hurry up and go, you Pervy Sage!
 Oh no, little Jiraiya, you tell so many lies!
 What do you mean?! Everything is true!
 Dang it! It doesn’t break no matter how much I try…
 I’m just dripping away my Chakra this way.
 Also…
 The more I increase the amount of flow, the worse the pain gets.
 But… How do I say it?
 If I don’t go all out as if to explode the Chakra,
 it’s not going to break!
 That’s it!
 If I understand the amount of Chakra that flows from the pain I feel…
 Then I can bear the pain to the limit and all at once…
 No, not yet…
 Not yet!
 Not yet…store it!
 Now!
 Oww!
 Hmm… There seems to have been a little progress.
 Humph!
 I’ve still only opened a hole and it hasn’t popped with a bang!
 Hey, don’t pretend to be so tough. Here!
 You’ve done well, all on your own power.
 It’s so good!
 Yes…
 Oh yeah. Maybe we’ll test a bit.
 What, what?
 Give me your right hand.
 What’s this?
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 He tells me  ""focus, focus, focus!""
 But I've never been good at it, ever.
 Speaking of concentration,
 Iruka Sensei used to scold me often at the Ninja Academy
 for my lack of concentration.
 Oh…I would've listened to him better if I knew this would happen.

 a failure will always be a failure.
 There's no changing that!
 Do you want to see about that?
 You!
 Naruto, I get where you're coming from, believe me.
 But all fighting must be done officially in a match!
 The failure beats the gifted genius through sheer effort…
 Wouldn't that make for an exciting main battle?
 I promise you.
 I will win no matter what!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee: The Power of Youth Explodes!
 Hey, Choji!
 You're in trouble.
 Only the strong ones are left.
 Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound must be that bloke.
 And Lee is apparently strong enough to take on Sasuke!
 And particularly that Sand guy!
 He's probably the most dangerous one!
 I-I don't care!
 I plan to forfeit right away if that happens…
 So that means…
 Huh?
 ...you plan to forego all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
 What? Come on!
 Don’t worry.
 If things start getting ugly,
 I'll step in and stop the fight, like I did for Hinata. Okay?
 Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
 – You can eat what you want. – Don't dangle food in front of him!
 – Besides he didn't step in... – You can eat whatever you want...
 – and stop the fight for Hinata. – and all you want.
 B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q! All you can eat!
 He doesn't look good.
 Watching the previous fight…
 Did it get stirred up?
 His inner demon!
 I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…
 Here's a plan.
 Kankuro?
 Just a little information-gathering mission.
 Hey!
 Huh?
 What are you doing here all by yourself?
 Shouldn't you be with your friends?
 I-It's none of your business, is it?!
 Hmmm. Well, well…
 That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?
 Well, it seems to me that
 he didn't reveal the true extent of his power in that last match.
 What's he about?
 I'm going to crush him!
 Err, that's not what I was asking.
 Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...
 You seem like a fun guy. I quite like you.
 You're dull. And I don't like you at all!
 I'm going to waste this guy!
 We will now resume the battle.
 Okay!
 You'll be up this time for sure. Go for it, Lee!
 No!
 – Huh? 					– What?
 Seeing as I've come this far, I rather be the last!
 Is Lee sulking?
 Hurry up and get down here…
 Safe!
 – Hey! – Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
 Gaara vs. Rock Lee
 Oh! Lee!
 It worked!
 If you say you want to go last, then you won't be last.
 It's an application of the same law
 that says a stone thrown to hit a telephone pole will miss,
 and a stone thrown to miss will be a direct hit!
 Right! That's my student!
 I absolutely did not want to go last!
 I threw them a beauty of a curve!
 Threw whom a curve?
 Okay, so let me give you a little piece of “nice” advice.
 Right!
 Probably no one has noticed yet, but…
 That gourd is suspicious!
 I see!
 Quit with the notes!
 You're not going to have time to read them during the match! Fool!
 I see!
 He didn't realize that?
 Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
 All right! 					Go! Lee!
 Yeah!
 I am very happy to be squaring off with you so early in the match.
 I don't know what kind of moves that bowl-cut guy has,
 but he will never take Gaara.
 Never!
 He's fast, to be sure, but his kick is not all that great.
 No…
 He's... strong!
 Please don't be in such a hurry.
 Lee…
 Be careful, Lee.
 Now then… The 9th match...
 Begin!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 Is that…?
 Sand?
 What an unusual Jutsu…
 There's sand in his gourd!
 That's…
 That's it?
 Desert Coffin!
 Desert Burial!
 Not another horror story like that…
 A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
 Sounds like trouble.
 But let's give it a go!
 Even that Lee’s fast strikes…
 have no effect at all!
 What's the deal?!
 No physical strike is going to have any effect on him.
 What?
 The Sand shields and protects Gaara
 on its own accord, independently of any intent on Gaara's part.
 That's why... no one has been able to do it so far....
 Injure Gaara, that is.
 Curses! He's not moving a muscle and still...!
 Is that it?
 Entertain me a bit more…
 There's not enough yet!
 Blood!
 Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
 He'll never be able to get close enough for that!
 Why doesn't he step back a bit and use Ninjutsu or something?
 It’s not that he doesn't use it.
 He can’t use it.
 Huh?
 Lee has almost no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills.
 N-No way!
 When I first met Lee, he was completely inept.
 He had no talent whatsoever.
 What? I can't believe that!
 Hey hey!
 Certainly…
 A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsu and Genjutsu is a rarity.
 That’s why, the only path open to Lee as a Ninja was Taijutsu.
 But! That's precisely what makes him a winner!
 Huh?
 Lee, take them off!
 B-But Guy Sensei...!
 You told me only to do that
 to protect a large group of very important people!
 That’s quite all right!
 I give you permission!
 Are those…?
 Weights?
 That's some cliché training…
 I see!
 Ridiculous!
 All right, now I can move easily!
 Humph! Does he think removing some measly little weights
 is going to enable him to outmaneuver Gaara's sand…?
 A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
 Go, Lee!
 Right!
 Go!
 Very close!
 Fast!
 Amazing…!
 Because he can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu...
 Therefore, he channeled all of his time,
 all of his energy and...
 all of his being into Taijutsu.
 Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…
 He won't lose to anyone…
 He is a Taijutsu specialist!
 I can't believe it! Gaara's been injured!
 No way...!
 Bushy-Brows is even faster than before!
 Was he this strong?!
 Youth is... explosion!
 Right!
 Over here!
 Good!
 I got him good!
 A-Amazing, he's so fast!
 The Sand Shield can't keep up with him!
 A direct hit!
 A-Amazing.
 His strikes are lightning fast…!
 I can't even track him with my eyes!
 Uh oh…
 Uh oh is right!
 That black-circles-under-the-eye guy is taking some serious blows!
 That's not what I meant.
 Huh?
 W-What the…?!
 His face is crumbling right off…!
 His whole body is covered with sand….
 There's not a scratch on him!
 W-What’s with this guy?!
 Sure enough, he was encased in sand, eh.
 But, it's been a long time since
 I've seen that expression on Gaara's face.
 I felt that he was becoming more and more unstable
 as the Chunin Exam progressed…
 So Gaara's other self has been awakened, eh?
 Hey! What is that?
 That protected him against Bushy-Brow's strikes?
 Yes… It's Sand Armor.
 Armor?
 Ordinarily, the Sand Shield functions to protect him automatically,
 but, if by chance, the Shield is penetrated,
 the Sand Armor functions as a second layer of protection against strikes…
 That's Gaara's…absolute defense!
 Well then, there's no way to get him!
 He doesn't have any weak points.
 No. That’s not entirely true…
 The Sand Armor is actually riddled with weak points.
 First of all, because it's not automatic, it uses up a lot of Chakra.
 It's also less effective than the Sand Shield,
 and it takes an enormous amount of physical energy
 to keep the sand clinging to the body like that.
 Gaara's having to use the armor... is proof that he's under pressure.
 That Lee is really good…
 But, the outcome of the match is already a given.
 He will never beat Gaara!
 Is that all?
 But what an incredible defense he has...
 no amount of speed is going to let me get a strike through.
 I'll have to do major damage from above the sand guard.
 That will be Lotus!
 Yes.
 Be ready!
 A thin sand guard like that will be inconsequential
 in the face of Lee's high-speed Lotus slamming down from above.
 Hurry up and bring it on!
 You asked for it!
 He didn’t float.
 Not just yet!
 What an amazing series of kicks!
 Even an ordinary Lotus has a tremendous strain on the body…!
 Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 I got him...
 good!
 Right on!
 I-It's over!
 W-What? This can’t be!
 He did it! Lee’s won!
 Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
 Wha--?!
 Huh?!
 What?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
 All of your strength seems to have disappeared!
 You're going to be destroyed at this rate!
 But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
 How can he continue to keep up a fighting stance
 when he's being routed like this?!

152,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 It’s a custom where balance is preserved by fighting and removing life.
 This is the friendship of the Shinobi world.
 This is a fight for life with the pride of the village and
 one’s own dream on the line.
 Heh, I’m convinced.
 Anything is fine.
 Just tell us the content of that fight-for-life test.
 Very well.
 Now then, this is where I’d like to explain the third exam.
 But actually…
 Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was given the task of judge, to speak first.
 I leave it to you…
 There’s something... I’d like you all to do...
 before the third exam.
 And that is a preliminary to the third exam,
 with participation in the main battle on the line.
 Preliminary?
 What do you mean…preliminary?!
 Sensei, I don’t understand the point of that preliminary.
 Why aren’t we doing the next exam with the remaining test-takers?
 This time around,
 perhaps because the first and second exams were easy,
 there are a few too many people left, you see.
 In accordance with the rules of the Chunin Exams,
 a preliminary will be held in order to reduce the number advancing.
 N-No way!
 As Lord Hokage said before,
 many guests will be coming  to the third exam.
 So we can’t have long pointless matches and our time is limited as well.
 Therefore, those of you not in top physical condition…
 Hey, is he okay…?!
 The teacher doesn’t look well himself?!
 Excuse me.
 Those of you who wish to drop out, please speak up now.
 The preliminary will begin immediately, so…
 Immediately, you say…?!
 But we finally made it through  the second exam.
 This is a pain…
 Huh? What about our meal?
 Narrowing the Field: Sudden Death Elimination!
 Okay!
 I’m going to do my best, no matter what!
 I promised Kabuto, too…
 And oh...
 I forgot to mention this, but it will be individual battles from now on.
 It is your decision, so feel free to raise your hands and drop out.
 Who’s going to quit?!
 Sasuke?!
 The waves of pain are coming faster...
 Sasuke… I knew it.
 Sasuke, you should quit these preliminaries!
 Huh?!
 L-Look, you haven't been yourself
 ever since you got worked over by that Orochimaru guy!
 That bruise hurts even now, right…?
 Bruise…?
 At this rate…!
 I gave him a parting gift.
 Sasuke will definitely seek me… in search of power.
 You’re the only one left.
 Please…
 Please, quit!
 I’m…scared.
 Sakura…
 I knew it.
 What shall we do?
 We should remove him from the exams
 and isolate him with Anbu bodyguards on him.
 We should recommend that he retire immediately.
 He’s not the kind of type to  just obey like that…?!
 After all, he’s of the Uchiha clan.
 What’re you talking nonsense for?!
 I’ll make him stop, by force if needed!
 The Curse Mark responds even when one’s just building up Chakra
 and attempts to forcibly extract his strength!
 It’s a prohibited Jutsu that eats into the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!
 It’s a wonder that kid is even enduring it.
 He should really already be dead!
 Lord Hokage!
 You’re in no condition to fight properly, Sasuke…!
 Shut up.
 I understand!
 Be quiet!
 But you’ve been enduring the pain this whole time, right?!
 Please be quiet!
 No matter what you say, Sasuke...
 I’m going to tell the teachers about the bruise!
 If I do that...
 Well…
 Oh…?!
 What…?
 Excuse me…I’ll quit.
 K-Kabuto…?
 Let's see...
 Kabuto Yakushi of the Leaf Village, correct?
 Then, you may step back.
 Okay.
 Kabuto!
 Why’re you quitting?!
 Tell me! Why?!
 This guy…
 I’m sorry, Naruto…
 But my body is worn out.
 Actually before the first exam...
 when I wrangled with the guys from Sound Village,
 I’ve had no hearing at all in my left ear.
 To fight right away…
 and to be told that my life would also be on the line, I can’t go on.
 I’ve seen that face a few times.
 As I recall, I think he dropped out of the main battle before, as well.
 What in the world is he thinking?
 Anko.
 Uh…yes.
 Kabuto Yakushi.
 According to the data, he has failed six straight times.
 What about his background?
 From his time at the Academy,
 he was a student who did not really stand out,
 and his grades were ordinary.
 He finally passed the graduation  exam on his third try.
 After that, as for the missions he carried out,
 two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.
 It’s not a battle record to write home about.
 However…
 However…?
 It’s about before the Academy.
 Hmm?
 Do you remember the story...
 about the one boy brought back from the Kikyo Pass battle?
 I remember.
 As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor at the battlefield
 was taken back by a Jonin from the medical unit.
 So he’s that boy…?
 Don’t take arbitrary actions.
 Have you forgotten Orochimaru’s orders?
 I leave it to you guys.
 You in particular, Yoroi.
 There should be no problems here with your ability.
 This is where you can show your strength.
 Those of you who are irritated that I’m ahead of you.
 So you’re Orochimaru’s favorite, huh?
 Don’t get all high and mighty, kid.
 I understand, Yoroi sir.
 Oh.
 Naruto… Sasuke…
 I wanted to play with you guys a little more.
 But if I do more than this…
 The old me might get stirred up.
 I am a spy so far as it goes.
 I cannot expose myself, here.
 Also…if you are going to watch.
 My role of information collecting has served its purpose…
 Master Orochimaru.
 I’ll save the fun, for some other time…
 Sasuke…
 And Naruto...
 You too.
 Now then, there are no others who will quit?
 I must tell the teachers, about Sasuke’s bruise!
 Huh?!
 Be quiet about this bruise.
 Why’re you acting tough like that?!
 I don’t want to watch you suffer all the time anymore!
 For me you are…!
 This has nothing to do with you!
 It’s none of your business.
 I said it once before…
 I’m an avenger.
 This is not just a mere exam to me.
 The Chunin business has nothing to do with me.
 “Am I strong?” All I want is the answer to that.
 By fighting with those who are strong!
 And…
 I’m Gaara of the desert.
 Hey, you there… ldentify yourself.
 I declare.
 You are absolutely no match for me.
 If I have the opportunity to fight you in the next exam,
 we won’t run or hide.
 And they’re... here!
 I will not allow even you to take my path away from me!
 Sasuke…
 You!
 What’re you doing putting up a front, you idiot?!
 Here Sakura is this worried about you--!
 Naruto!
 I want to fight you, too.
 Huh?!
 What Orochimaru said is sitting on my mind.
 I will let Sasuke do the test...
 – and see how things go. – Wha--?!
 L-Lord Hokage…!
 However, if the Curse Mark opens
 and the power gets even a little bit out of control,
 get in there and stop it.
 All right.
 But...!
 I understand.
 Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.
 The preliminaries to come will be one-on-one individual battles.
 In other words, actual battle format.
 There are now exactly twenty people, so we will conduct ten battles.
 The winners will be able to advance to the third exam.
 There are no rules at all.
 You will fight until someone dies,  collapses…or admits defeat.
 And... please admit defeat right away  if you don’t want to die.
 However, in case I judge that a match is over…
 err... I don’t want to needlessly increase dead bodies,
 so I will intervene and stop the match or something to that effect.
 What holds the key to your destinies is…
 Open it.
 This.
 The names of two foes will be randomly selected and
 displayed on this electronic signboard.
 Now then, let’s get right down to it
 and announce the two names for the first battle.
 Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
 To think it’d be so soon…?!
 I couldn’t ask for more.
 No way…!
 Why Sasuke?!
 Now then, the two displayed on the signboard, come forward.
 For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.
 No objections, right?
 – Right. 					– No!
 All I can do now is watch…
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke!
 If you want to fight me, don’t lose!
 Sasuke… You’re acting strange…
 Is it because of the Curse Mark…?
 Sasuke, do your best!
 I guess I’ll wait and see…
 The pain won’t go away!
 It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
 Now then, we will begin the first battle.
 Everyone other than the two foes, please move to the upper area.
 Hey! Kakashi Sensei!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 Don’t use the Sharingan.
 So you knew?
 If that Curse Mark on your neck gets out of control,
 it could endanger your life.
 I believe it.
 Well, the match will be called off at that time.
 I’ll be coming in to stop it, so good luck.
 Called off, you say?!
 It seems this Curse Mark thing  is responding to my Chakra.
 This is my final Chakra…
 Sharingan!
 Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!
 If I carelessly build up Chakra,
 it would extract my spirit energy,
 and bring out the Chakra inside my body to no end.
 In other words, in this match,
 I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu, not to mention the Sharingan!
 However... Yoroi’s ability is  the worst for you, Sasuke.
 Now then… How will I go…?
 Don’t act rashly…Sasuke.
 Now then, please begin.
 Let’s go!
 Yeah!
 Oh no!
 He did it!
 My strength…?!
 W-What is this?
 My body strength has suddenly…!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke…!
 You…my Chakra…
 You just noticed now…?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born

 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Dang it! The pain won't go away!
 This darned Curse Mark is responding all the time!
 But I won't let this exam get called off!
 How will I do? How should I fight?
 Am I strong?
 All I want is the answer to that.
 I won't let this thing swallow me up in a place like this!

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.

 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side

 –Yeah! 					–This way! This way!
 I said wait!
 Lady Tsunade…
 With regard to the next request…
 What, there’s more?
 Yes.
 Boy oh boy…
 This is the last one so please try to focus.
 All right.
 When the weather continues to be warm like this…
 And what’s the request?
 About the escort for the convoy with the fugitive who was secured…
 What about it, that’s hardly a difficult mission.
 Well, actually there’s a bit of a problem.
 Please look at this.
 I see. This is somewhat of a nuisance.
 All of the Jonin are out on S-rank missions,
 and 90% of the main Chunin and Genin have been allocated elsewhere.
 Who’s left?
 Let’s see…well…
 Multi-Clone Jutsu!
 Let’s go, Bushy Brows!
 Here goes, Naruto!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 You jerk!
 Another serving of Shadow Clones for you!
 You ain’t seen nothing yet!
 You let your guard down!
 Pretty good, Bushy Brow…
 The same to you, Naruto…
 Naruto! Lee!
 Hey, are you guys all right?
 Hey, stop moving.
 Sakura, can’t you be a little more gentle?
 Shut your mouth. Really, you’re being reckless.
 That’s not true, Sakura.
 See, the 100-man Shadow Clone grapples
 are excellent training for enhancing one’s Taijutsu skills.
 It’s like killing two birds with one stone for Naruto, too
 because this kind of friendly training lets him polish
 his Shadow Clone skills at the same time.
 That’s exactly right.
 What are you talking about? All you’re doing is slugging it out.
 This is what ends up happening when two guys get together.
 That’s right.
 Anyway, this isn’t the time to be acting carefree like that.
 Lady Tsunade is calling for you.
 Grandma Tsunade?
 What does she want?
 Ninja Dropouts?
 Yeah. 					Ninja Dropouts are
 Rogue Ninja who, of their own free will,
 choose not to be Shinobi and leave their respective villages to join up.
 They’re a gang of thieves who use brutal and villainous means to steal.
 That’s horrible…using their abilities as Ninja for criminal purposes.
 That’s unforgivable.
 One of their members was captured yesterday
 in Ogi Pass in the Land of Forests.
 This guy is the only member
 whose wanted notice is circling around the lands.
 He was found wandering about and taken prisoner.
 His name is Gantetsu.
 For a former Ninja, that’s pretty lame.
 Gantesu is being taken to the capital city of the Land of Forests
 in order to do an exhaustive investigation into this matter
 for the purpose of wiping out the Ninja Dropouts…
 However, there is a possibility that the Ninja Dropouts will try
 to rescue him along the way…
 A police escort has been sent from the capital
 so it is fully prepared for the convoy.
 But since the opponents are ex-Ninja,
 the idea is that Shinobi would be the best countermeasure for Shinobi,
 so they requested that the Leaf Village also send out some Ninja.
 That’s what this request is all about.
 I’m getting excited! I’ll show ‘em how great Leaf Ninja are!
 –Got it! –Let’s give it a shot!
 All right! Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno, Rock Lee.
 The three of you are assigned to the mission
 of guarding the Gantetsu convoy!
 –Yes, ma’am! 					–Roger!
 Look, the harbor.
 Huh… So they’re gonna transport him in this.
 The only way to get to the capital of the Land of Forests is
 to go up this river.
 Hey, look over there.
 That’s…
 The Ninja Dropout, Gantetsu.
 Are you the Leaf Ninja?
 Yes. Uh, and who are you?
 I’m Tsuzumi with the police department.
 I’m supervising this convoy.
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 This guy here’s Bushy Brows and her name is Sakura Haruno.
 Hmmm… You guys are still kids… Are you really Ninja?
 We sure are.
 Huh, we might not look it,
 but we’re all full-fledged Ninja who’ve been tested by fire numerous times.
 We’ll display our skills for you at some point.
 Just leave it to us.
 Well, I have a strong team of experts handling security,
 but if it ever comes to that,
 I’m counting on you to use your specialty, Ninjutsu.
 Got it.
 Those are the security personnel guarding the prisoner.
 They’re all dressed alike, aren’t they?
 Huh, they don’t have much style.
 Naruto, that’s rude.
 Captain Todoroki!
 What is it, Commander Tsuzumi?
 These people came from
 the Village Hidden in the Leaves as reinforcements.
 The name’s Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m Sakura Haruno.
 My name is Rock Lee.
 Commander, I told you already.
 We already have enough security on this.
 Can’t be helped. lt’s something the bosses decided.
 There won’t be any role for you guys to play.
 We will guard Gantetsu.
 I promise that on this sword.
 Huh… That sword’s nothing.
 Snapping that thing in half would be as easy as apple pie.
 Yeah, with just one finger.
 Stop it, you guys! Please excuse them…
 Be careful not to get seasick.
 Well, I leave it to you.
 Y-Yes, sir. Thanks.
 Gantetsu…
 All right…
 Put the cage into the belly of the ship!
 Okay…Okay…
 Okay, lower it!
 Wow…
 This feels great!
 What the heck is this anyway?
 They won’t let us even get near him.
 They’re totally treating us like nuisances.
 If only those Ninja Dropout guys would launch an attack,
 we could show them how awesome we are.
 Don’t say stupid things like that.
 The best scenario would be that the Ninja Dropout won’t show up at all.
 Our mission is to transport Gantetsu safely to the capital, you know.
 But this is getting too boring… there’s no thrill to it.
 Better just grin and bear it.
 There are missions like this too.
 Well, I sure understand how you feel, Naruto.
 Yeah… I guess this is getting a little boring.
 Dig in…
 Gimme a break…
 Who do those guys think we are?
 But this stuff is pretty good.
 Yeah, very tasty.
 It makes me so mad…
 I mean, why did we go to all the trouble of coming all this way?
 I’m gonna do my mission.
 Gonna stand guard over Gantetsu.
 But the captain’s gonna scold you.
 I’m doing this out of Ninja pride!
 Uh, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 He does have the face of a criminal after all.
 Todoroki?
 What the heck is he doing here?
 Akio…!
 Damn!
 Father! Mother!
 Akio…
 Akio!
 Damn!
 Akio…!
 I will avenge your death right now!
 Oh!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 Are you in your right mind?
 What was it you were about to do just now?!
 Ninja Art: Crimson Mud.
 Oh?
 What’s the matter, Sakura?
 Lee, over there.
 That’s strange…
 I’ve never knew this river has a tributary.
 Why are you in here?
 Why does that matter?
 What were you about to do to Gantetsu!?
 What are you talking about?
 It looked to me like you were going to kill him.
 Huh? Me? That’s a stupid thing to say.
 It’s my mission to guard this guy. Why would I?!
 Yeah, I guess.
 Even if he is a criminal,
 you can’t just kill him off without interrogating him first.
 A brat talking like he knows, huh?
 There isn’t any need to interrogate him!
 This is the guy who did it!
 Huh?
 This guy…
 These guys…slaughtered a lot of people without mercy…
 Even innocent children.
 If things continue like this, we’ll be sucked into the tributary…
 What should we do?!
 Ninja Art: Link and Slay.
 What the heck?!
 Wh-What is this?
 Th-The ship’s been sliced in half…
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 You jerk!
 It’s them! The Ninja Dropouts!
 So they showed up after all…
 Gantetsu…
 Reinforcements, huh?!
 Hey, who are you guys anyway!
 The head of the Ninja Dropouts, Shura, on the scene!
 Ninja Dropouts…
 We’ll take Gantetsu…
 I’m not about to let that happen!

 Lee, are you all right?
 Yes, somehow. More importantly, what happened?
 I don’t know.
 Only thing I know is that after that huge crash,
 suddenly the ship was sliced in two…
 I see.
 Well then, we need to confirm everyone’s safety for the moment…
 Well…
 What’s wrong, Sakura?
 I can’t find the prisoner, Gantetsu, Captain Todoroki, and Naruto.

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 This is as far as you go. Give Matsuri back.
 You think you’ve got me cornered now?
 Don’t get the wrong idea. You’re the one who’s been cornered!
 What?
 Byakugan!
 He has the final enemy cornered in a dead-end valley.
 The area around the valley is eerily calm.
 I don’t see his comrades.
 Is Shikamaru’s final move finished?
 No.
 We can’t state definitively that they’ve reached a deadlock.
 It’s because it’s possible that the battles thus far were diversions.
 Just a little more, Lee.
 It’ll be over once I connect two or three more muscles.
 Sakura’s Medical Ninja technique is really becoming…
 And yet I…
 The treatment is over for now. How do you fight to get like this?
 I’m sorry.
 You saved me. Thank you, Sakura.
 You’re welcome.
 Oh, you can’t, yet.
 As one of the Medical Team members, I prohibit you from fighting any further.
 No, please let me go.
 I can’t just leave Gaara like this…
 We’re Team Return-the-Favor, after all.
 The Ultimate Weapon Reborn
 Gaara, you may very well be called the ultimate weapon,
 but have you not used up all of your sand in the fight earlier?
 This is my weapon.
 Indeed I have used up almost all of the sand with Chakra built up inside.
 But…
 No matter what Jutsu you use, I must not lose in a one-on-one battle.
 There’s nothing scary about a Shinobi with no weapon!
 Come, Infinite Kujaku Armor!
 Fang Release: Dark Sword! Flying Double Edge Sword!
 You’ll realize that the likes of a mere Ninja
 is no match for the Ninja tools created by us artisans.
 Fang Release: Dark Sword!
 It seems your own body’s Chakra has run out.
 You’re carrying a monster inside you, right?
 Now, isn’t it about time you used the power of Shukaku?
 You okay?
 Gaara Sensei is…
 Yeah, I know.
 Listen up. You hide in a safe place somewhere.
 Right.
 Although Gaara received Sakura’s treatment, he's still…
 That’s as far as you go, ultimate weapon of the Sand Village!
 Damn it.
 Use the power of the Shukaku already.
 Hey!
 Hold it!
 Who are you?
 I’ll be your opponent from here on.
 You’re in the way, boy.
 Kujaku Hurricane!
 Damn it!
 Leaf Shinobi, you watch.
 The era of control by the Five Great Nations will end.
 No, it won’t be just that.
 If the ultimate Ninja tool created by the Artisan Village is completed,
 the existence of the Ninja will no longer be necessary.
 What’re you talking about?!
 We are people from the Village of Artisans who for many years
 have equally shared exceptional Ninja tools
 with you in the Five Great Nations.
 However, each time relations worsened between fellow villages,
 the Village of Artisans would be attacked
 over fear of Ninja tools crossing over to the other village.
 You Ninja of the Five Great Nations have forgotten
 that you are kept alive by our power,
 and have returned the favor with vengeance time and again.
 Although we the people of the Village of Artisans have advanced skills,
 we have had to survive by currying favor from the Five Great Nations!
 However, that era will now end!
 First, I will take out the Leaf Village.
 Fang Release Dark Sword!
 How long can you run away for?
 I’ll stake you like a shrike!
 What?!
 You!
 Gaara Sensei!
 Gaara Sensei’s sand protected the Leaf Ninja.
 That dome created with hard minerals in the ground mixed with sand…
 can’t be smashed by such junk.
 I’ll protect him until the end…
 with my power!
 Gaara Sensei!
 Don’t make me laugh!
 You, who are called the greatest creation of the Sand, a terrifying weapon,
 are going to protect someone else?
 And you’re going to use what little Chakra you have left
 for the sake of a comrade?
 But that will be your death!
 Gaara Sensei!
 With this, all preparations are complete.
 Damn it.
 Oh!
 Gaara!
 We were contacted by someone from the Village of Artisans.
 It seems ones calling themselves the Four Celestials,
 bearing long-withstanding hostilities against the Five Great Nations…
 have completed forbidden research and are attempting to resurrect
 the ultimate weapon of folklore in the village.
 It seems the villagers got wind of the crisis
 and have evacuated to a different location.
 I see. So that’s why the village was completely empty.
 So what exactly is this ultimate weapon?
 The resurrection of Seimei, the founder of the Village of Artisans.
 Seimei?!
 Are you saying they’re trying to raise the dead?!
 I see. It makes sense that the mausoleum was violated.
 As for us, we must prevent the resurrection
 of the ultimate weapon at all costs.
 I understand. I’ll be off.
 Oh, hold on.
 Yes?
 I’ll be having one more person accompany you on this mission.
 What? Who would that be?
 What we wanted was the Shukaku’s Chakra.
 What did you say?
 How we’ve waited for this time.
 Now Gaara, turn into the Shukaku now.
 And infuse me with that power.
 Gaara!
 I’ll save you now.
 Naruto!
 Matsuri, take this.
 My rope javelin.
 The optic nerves have connected…
 Open…
 third eye!
 Hey, you.
 What the heck do you intend to start?
 I’ll show you.
 The ultimate Ninja tool created by Lord Seimei,
 the founder of our Village of Artisans.
 Ultimate Ninja tool?
 Now is the time of its completion.
 Gaara!
 Oh, Lord Seimei.
 Please take possession of my flesh and complete your resurrection!
 Oh!
 What’s going on? He vanished.
 The dead body came back to life!
 My name is Seimei. The founder of the Village of Artisans.
 A hundred years have passed and
 I have now been resurrected as the ultimate Ninja tool
 of the Village of Artisans!
 What in the world is happening here?!
 My long-awaited wish has at last come to fruition.
 With this, my Village of Artisans will reign over the Shinobi apex.
 I see…
 So the monster from the Sand Village became the source of my power.
 Say what?
 Hoko said this.
 There is a monster lying within the body
 of the one called Gaara from the Sand Village.
 Once that person is in a cage,
 soon he will become a complete monster, the Shukaku.
 I will take away what you could consider infinite Chakra from the Shukaku.
 I won’t let you do that!
 Damn it!
 Just wait, Gaara. I’ll get you out now.
 What a waste…
 Vortex Wind.
 I’m just getting started!
 What a fool!
 I’ll get you out now!
 Damn it, damn it!
 Gaara! Can you hear my voice?!
 Gaara, answer me! What’s going on in there?!
 Gaara!
 Gaara!
 N-Naruto…
 Shikamaru!
 What?
 Where are Gaara and Naruto?
 Neji, Hinata, tell me the situation.
 There’s a cage behind an area surrounded by rocks…
 There’s a massive amount of Chakra being extracted from there.
 Gaara must be inside.
 Hey, Shikamaru!
 What?
 You know there’s a terrifying power lying dormant inside Gaara, right?
 Yeah, generally.
 Something terrible will happen…
 if Gaara has Chakra extracted like this and he loses himself!
 The Shukaku that had been kept under control will go out of control.
 Once it starts going berserk, there will be no way to stop Gaara.
 For real?
 I must not waste any more time.
 The entertainment ends here.
 Hot-hot-hot-hot.
 Damn it! Just wait, Gaara!
 I’ll get you out now!
 You’re a pest!
 Give it up already!
 I’m just getting started!
 Solid Blanks!
 Oh, how I have waited for this time.
 Now, Shukaku! Give me power!
 I feel it. This is an amazing power!
 Cut out the futile resistance.
 The power of the Shukaku is already mine!
 I declare war on the Five Great Nations.
 The Shinobi in the Five Great Nations who made light of the Artisan Shinobi
 will fully realize the 100-year grudge of the Artisan Ninja.
 And they will inevitably become our sacrifices.
 Knock it off!
 What?!
 We won’t hand over our power to the likes of you.
 I won’t let you take away any more of Gaara’s Chakra.
 You got that?!
 How can that person fight while getting that beaten up?
 Why do you go this far, kid?
 What is the monster of the Sand Village to you?
 Gaara…
 Gaara is an important comrade to me!
 He said he fights for those important to him.
 Fights for someone important.
 Very well. Then die!
 What’re you doing, little girl?
 I finally figured out what Gaara Sensei taught me.
 Weapons took away the lives of my mother and father.
 But I can also protect those important to me with a weapon!
 Foolishness.
 Damn it!
 It has finally begun, huh…?
 Gaara Sensei…
 Gaara!
 Gaara.

 Yes. He is starting to transform to Shukaku.

 This is bad. lf Gaara loses his conscious in that state,
 the true Shukaku will come out.
 When that happens he won’t know a foe from friend,
 he will just destroy everything.

 A man should always repay the debt he owes a woman.
 Always the bothersome guy with the man and woman stuff!
 Gaara and Kankuro are chasing after the guys who took our village girl.
 Forget about here and head for them!
 We’ve received information.
 Gaara and Kankuro have entered their respective battles.
 I see…
 The shadow won’t reach, I guess…
 Leaf Village’s two-man cells are just now heading there for back-up.
 How well prepared.
 It’s a pain,
 but as long as we’re doing this, we’ll do it right.
 We’ll do it perfectly without producing casualties!
 Make sure you don’t cry in front of me this time.
 Are you going to hold that over my head forever?
 Just like a woman…
 I-I feel like I don’t really have my place in this.
 I’ll take care of all of you at once!
 Here it comes!
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together

 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.

 Sealed Sand: The Counterattack!
 To think you’d ask the Leaf Village for help…
 I guess the Sand has lost the edge they used to have, huh?
 Why are you here?
 You know, dogs.
 They’re not satisfied until a favor has been properly returned.
 Especially this Akamaru!
 A dog retuning a favor doesn’t have much of a ring to it!
 Help is on the way to the other two as well.
 You concentrate on this fight!
 You’re giving me lip!
 So you flies are gonna gang up on me, huh?
 But you’re no match for my Dragon Eye: Fang Release: Dark Sword.
 Eat this!
 If your Chakra isn't built up, your sand is no big deal at all!
 It’ll only be useful for blinding me at best!
 It’s futile!
 I feel it. Your Chakra is being sucked up.
 What?! He was setting the sand in the gourd aside?!
 I was being cautious, but he is much too strong.
 Gaara Sensei!
 Just what I’d expect from Gaara of the Sand.
 He’s not called the ultimate weapon for nothing…
 The ultimate…weapon?!
 However, he cannot exceed our Ninja tools
 forged in the Village of the Artisans!
 Gaara!
 Hey, he’s totally got the edge!
 Do we have a chance to return the favor?
 That’s incredible wind. What an amount of Chakra…
 No, it seems that sword is amplifying her Chakra.
 So she’s relying on that sword for all of her attack and defense, huh?
 Anyway, we’ve got to slip within firing range for our Jutsu
 and stop her movements!
 Right.
 Let’s go at once!
 Annoying!
 She’s attempting to maintain her distance just from Temari.
 I see.
 So she just wants to pay attention to the long range-type Temari and
 blow us mid-range Jutsu users away with wind
 before we can get close, huh…?
 Now then, what should we do?
 Man Beast Clone!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Crow!
 – Arms! 					– Fang Over Fang!
 Did you guys come to get in my way?!
 We made sure to send you a signal, right?!
 How could I tell?!
 We don’t click at all?
 Are you guys…messing around?!
 Be more serious and die!
 Talking nonsense!
 Although I reduced the damage with my Infinite Kujaku Armor, still…
 Just what I’d expect of Gaara,
 the Sand’s ultimate weapon who hosts the Shukaku…
 But you’re already in our hands.
 What should I do? She’s beyond the range of my Jutsu…
 and I don’t see anything around here that could be used to extend my shadow.
 Hey!
 What’re you whispering about?
 What’re you thinking?!
 I’ll explain later, for crying out loud. Can you do it or not?
 I suppose I could try, but…
 What is it…?
 What’s he doing?
 Behold the terror of Ninja tools our village created.
 What’s this Chakra?
 This is a water vein!
 I get it!
 The lines connecting the point in the center and triangle isn’t a Barrier…
 It’s a water vein!
 Ninja Tool Barrier: Reverse Scale Formation… Activate!
 Oh no!
 Gaara Sensei!
 The aim of the Reverse Scale Formation was a single point, Gaara from the start!
 Our swords accurately pierce a water vein
 and summon the water dragon.
 Sand has sucked up a large amount of water
 and has become as heavy as lead…
 Now Gaara can no longer use sand.
 Gaara!
 – Gaara! 					– Calm down!
 Lee and Naruto are heading for Gaara!
 That guy is?!
 They’ll save Gaara, no matter what.
 We need to concentrate on the enemy in front of us.
 To think you’d choose a sandy area to fall on…
 Just what I’d expect of Gaara of the desert…
 However!
 That’s as far as your useless resistance goes!
 Leaf Hurricane!
 A hero’s turn always comes late!
 That’s right!
 Sorry to keep you waiting, Gaara!
 Naruto…!
 It seems you rushed to everyone during the Sasuke incident…
 This time we’ve come to return the favor from that time.
 So we’ll take that guy on!
 You hurry to your student straight on!
 To think he’d corner you this far…
 – Lee! 					– Sakura!
 Leave Gaara’s treatment to me! Lee, you go with Naruto!
 – Sakura! 					– Got it!
 Then I’ll be going first!
 Be careful. His armor sucks up Chakra!
 I’ll suck up all of your Chakra!
 I see. So this means we can’t release our regular power?
 That doesn’t matter!
 Even without Chakra, we’ve got fighting spirit!
 Yes! We’ll go with that plus willpower!
 Just as I thought.
 That they haven’t launched anything during the fight thus far means
 the two reinforcements don’t have long range-type Jutsu.
 Then I’ll maintain this distance and…
 you’ll die getting torn up by the wind!
 While she’s distracted by Shikamaru and the others,
 I’ll just go for it!

 But, the depletion of Chakra is overwhelming.
 Contact from your friends…?
 – Ino’s hurt?! 					– Go!
 Wha--?! But in your condition…
 I’m okay now. Help your friend!
 Okay. Don’t push yourself.
 Yeah…
 What’re you doing?! Hurry up and go after your comrade!
 I’ll help my comrade.
 I’ll settle this in a moment.

 Huh?!
 What’re you aiming at?! Totally misguided…
 Say what?
 What’s the meaning of this?
 I’m sure I’d read your range already…!
 I’ll show you!
 I can create a shadow with this thick a current
 even if the water’s clear.
 My Jutsu’s range has infinitely improved by lifting the waterfall!
 The Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
 Summoning…
 Blade Dance!

 Gaara.
 You don’t have any sand left you can use.
 What’s this?!
 He smashed the Sand Armor.
 No way! But the sand heavy with water like that…

 At any rate, I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.
 A trust for your loyalty and your eyes that spotted Tsunade’s attack.
 Yes. We’re both from the same medical corps so…
 Her Chakra was overflowing with violent intent.
 Tsunade… I was really planning on resurrecting those two people.
 And here I went so far as to promise not to smash the Leaf Village…
 Orochimaru…
 I know that your promise of ”not touching the village” was a lie…
 Even though I knew that…I…
 Just one more time would’ve been fine…
 Just one more time, I wanted to see them…
 Just one more time… I wanted to touch them…
 Just one more time… To see those smiling faces…
 But…

 that I’d be able to see Nawaki and Dan shortly…

 I loved them… I truly loved them!

 Here I was trying to forget…
 This village is grandfather’s treasure!
 I’m going to protect it!
 'Cuz I’m the grandson of the First Hokage
 who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!
 I love this village and my comrades…
 So I want to protect them.
 Right! Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather.
 And the Hokage name will be mine!
 Unlike you… I will be the heir to the Hokage name, no matter what!
 Since my little sister died, that sole thought has sustained me.
 So I’ll become the Hokage…
 An existence that protects everyone…
 – Becoming the Hokage is my dream! – Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
 The precious dreams that they risked their lives for…
 Making those dreams come true was also my desire…
 Things that have formed eventually decay… You said that.
 But…
 after all, these are feelings that won’t decay…
 So our negotiations have broken down… lt can’t be helped.
 Since it’s come to this, I have no choice but to ask forcibly.

 Are you going to change the location?
 That would probably be better…
 There was another troublesome person with the Lady Tsunade’s attendant.
 That person may come to her aid.
 You’re going down!
 Who is…the troublesome person?
 One of Sannin, the same as you and Lady Tsunade…
 Jiraiya!
 I won’t let you get away, no matter what!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Huh… Princess Tsunade tore it up… big time.
 This means that Lady Tsunade refused…
 Where did old Tsunade go?
 That belongs to Lady Tsunade…!
 Tonton… Which way?
 Okay!
 It looks like you’re quite out of breath, too… Tsunade.
 It’s just about time.
 I’m not that great at Taijutsu, but…
 A Food Pill!
 That Sign…!
 This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu…
 He got my muscle…!
 I severed, ever so slightly,
 the bicep muscle of your upper arm and the rectus muscle of your thigh.
 Now you won’t be able to release your incredible strength.
 A Chakra scalpel, eh… Why don’t you target the arteries?
 Indeed, with this scalpel,
 I could cut the muscles and vessels without external injury.
 But as may be expected,
 I can’t make a long, delicate scalpel in the middle of battle
 that can reach the arteries and the heart muscle.
 But, even so…
 there’d be no problem at all if I target the opponent’s neck!
 Dang it! My intercostals got hit. My breathing…
 He’s no ordinary Medical Ninja.
 His Jutsu sense and his edge exceed even me in my heyday!
 It would still be trouble if you were to die on me.
 I won’t target your vital spot…
 But with this, you can’t move anymore…
 She’s amazing…
 Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able to budge due to difficulty breathing.
 It looks like it will be necessary to rough her up a little more…
 but not enough to kill her.
 Even though I’m trying to move my hand…
 my leg moves?!
 D-Don’t tell me! This is…
 You little!
 In my present condition,
 this seems to be the extent of my power…
 I see…
 It’s… It’s not the muscles… lt’s the nerves!
 It seems you’ve realized… That’s right. It’s the nerves!
 I changed Chakra into electricity…
 made an electrical field and poured electricity into your nerves.
 The communication between the brain and the body
 is all done with electric signals…
 Tsunade jumbled up all of the electric signals that are exchanged
 at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.
 Having left battle and yet such power…
 So this is the legendary Sannin?
 Healing-types use too much Chakra…
 But in this condition…
 If I try to move my right hand…
 my left leg moves.
 If I try to move my left ankle…
 my right shoulder moves.
 It’s difficult…
 But I’ve already grasped eighty percent of what moves when I move what.
 Don’t mess with me…
 with this low-level…
 Jutsu!
 What?! In only a moment, his body movements…
 You’re scared of blood, aren’t you?!
 I’ll show you plenty from now!
 Jiraiya…?
 It’s been a long time… Jiraiya.
 Orochimaru…
 You’ve got an evil look as usual.
 Huh?!
 K-Kabuto?
 Naruto…
 I see… So you know each other?
 We took the Chunin Exam together!
 Why are you here, Kabuto…?
 Get out of the way!
 Hey…
 I’ll take…
 these guys!
 Just because you’ve mastered your body movements…
 it doesn’t mean…
 you can move like normal!
 I won’t let you get away now!
 Too late!
 My body movements have finally returned…
 Blood…!
 Having two of the legendary Sannin as opponents is hairy, isn’t it…?
 So even if it's just one… I'll stop you!
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fighting with old Tsunade?!
 You’re slow, Naruto…
 That’s why you’re no match for Sasuke.
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Wha--?!
 That’s right…
 I was a spy from the Village Hidden in the Sound.
 Wh-What’re you saying?
 You’re lying, right, Kabuto?
 During the Chunin Exam you taught us a lot…
 And you also saved us.
 Well, I wanted to gather data on you guys.
 Naruto, there’s something I understood by gathering your data.
 You have no Ninja ability.
 Unlike Sasuke!
 It’s the first time I’ve seen Lady Tsunade like this…
 Please don’t push it too far alone.
 I’m your attendant, so…
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Even with a fierce look,
 you’re just a cute Genin who’s a fish out of water.
 Admittedly, I was anticipating the monster dwelling inside you…
 But now, with the legendary Sannin before me,
 you leave something to be desired.
 You’re just a puny zero. So if you meddle…
 I’ll kill you.
 You little!
 Don’t, Naruto!
 My body’s still…
 That hand…
 He shouldn’t be able to use that right hand anymore.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I’ll attack at once with four…
 and break him from the right side where he can’t defend!
 You little!
 Okay!
 What?
 Blood?
 Poison Needles!
 My neural reflexes still haven’t completely returned!
 I can’t dodge completely!
 With the headband…!
 Good job, acting so quickly…
 Thanks, Shizune!
 That’s…
 A Plasma Pill!
 A Plasma Pill?
 So he’s trying to replenish lost blood, huh…
 That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me…
 The blood is gushing out nicely, eh, Kabuto?
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Please take off the bandage on your left arm.
 That man is Orochimaru…
 At last, the real thing appears…
 Shizune!
 Y-Yes!
 You take care of… that guy with the glasses!
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Enough already, you traitor!
 Don't you dare touch Old Lady Tsunade again!
 Hey Old Lady, just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you!
 I won't run away! I won't give up!
 Just watch. This is my Way of Ninja!

157,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Funeral March for the Living
 Wh-Why…
 Why does such a good man have to…die?!
 It’s sad… 					lt’s so sad!
 I remember now…
 I forgot when, but you showed it to me, didn’t you?
 With a twinkle in your eye,
 you proudly said it was a memento of your father.
 That was the pipe box, wasn’t it? lt was an amazing box.
 No wonder you’re so proud of it…
 Even though I took it and smashed it, you only laughed.
 You were smiling when we kicked you and tossed you.
 It was a great smile.
 Really…
 Hold it in, Rokusuke! They’ll all be gone.
 If we let this moment go,
 there will be no other chance to get out of the village.
 But Kanpachi is…!
 It’s for the village,
 we have to do something and make our way to that village!
 Yeah…
 Funerals are awesome, aren’t they!
 I wanna do that again.
 One…two…three people… got away again…
 Looks like we can have another funeral.
 This is…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 You are…?
 Naruto Uzumaki! Right now, I’m in the middle of training.
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 H-Hey! I said hey!
 Hang in there!
 This is training too…!
 I can’t give up yet! Not yet!
 The escort for the ruler of the Land of Swamps, Lord Chichiyasu,
 was completed without incident!
 Well done.
 That’s Lady Tsunade’s…!
 Excellent dumplings are always from the Leaf Village, aren’t they?
 That was my last one!
 Mission Accomplished!
 I came to pound the pirates of the Gottani Channel
 with the fist of love!
 If they take this opportunity to rehabilitate themselves,
 it’s worth while to shed a tear!
 I’ll have your team do it for me.
 Yes?
 Even though we’re already busy, that Naruto brought in more work.
 After this, Guy has the S-rank mission.
 The client picked him, so he must depart today.
 So, do it without Guy.
 That’s pretty straightforward…
 I called Neji Hyuga, Tenten and Lee.
 Ohh!
 My pupils can undertake the fulfillment of this mission without incident!
 Wait…
 Take Naruto Uzumaki, too.
 Why can't it just be my pupils, who are loved by all the world?
 Please answer me, Lady Tsunade!
 It just is.
 Hidden Leaf Hospital
 Those three people that Naruto saved came all the way
 from the Katabami Gold Mine to request a mission.
 Katabami Gold Mine is one of the Land of Rivers’ greatest mines,
 but about half a year ago, hooligans calling themselves the Kurosuki family
 appeared on the pretext of guarding it, and took control of the village…
 killing villagers for no particular reason.
 How vile!
 Your mission is this:
 Once those three have regained their strength,
 escort them to Katabami Gold Mine and eliminate the Kurosuki family.
 It’s a simple mission.
 Well anyway, it must be a group of punks who’re after money.
 Why did you call me for such an easy mission?
 Who do you think you are?
 I’m busy searching for Sasuke and training, and--!
 You forced your way into missions that you weren’t called for.
 It’s not a Genin’s place to choose his missions!
 Would you like to be sent back to the Academy? Well?!
 Neji Hyuga!
 Yes!
 You’re the leader!
 It will be good training for you to try to tame the unstable.
 I don’t want to… but, I’ll do it!
 I’ll go continue my training!
 Hey Naruto!
 Please excuse them. They have no manners…
 Wait!
 Those little brats…!
 What the heck do they think missions are?!
 Umm, excuse me?
 What?!
 The Kurosuki Family…
 What did you say their boss’ name was?
 Raiga!
 That’s what I thought…
 What?
 Well, on a previous mission, I heard a rumor about him.
 A rumor…?
 Pervy Sage hasn’t returned… I’m forced to go on a mission…
 Oh, this is irritating…
 Sakura!
 Naruto?
 What’s going on? A bird?
 Yesterday I found it injured and treated it, but…
 Sakura, that’s amazing!
 But poor thing.
 It’s separated from its friends.
 Naruto!
 Oh, sorry, did I intrude?
 You intruded big time!
 No, no!
 Don’t turn your back, no need to grovel to youth.
 Sakura, Hello!
 Hello!
 What did you come here for?
 – Just to have a word. – Huh? What the--?!
 Oh, Sakura, goodbye!
 – Hey! What was that?! – She went wild, didn't she?
 She should act her age.
 Ichiraku 		What?! The boss of 		the Kurosuki family
 is one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist?
 Yeah, it’s exclusive information from our respected teacher, Guy.
 Who’re the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist?
 Naruto, you said that
 you fought in the Land of the Waves mission, didn’t you?
 At that time…
 Oh, Zabuza! And?
 And Guy Sensei and Kakashi Sensei fought Kisame Hoshigaki.
 I heard that you met them there too, Naruto.
 Oh! I know that guy!
 Those two were once called
 the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 And at that time, who was with Kisame Hoshigaki?
 Oh!
 The man called Itachi! And then?
 You still don’t understand?
 If Raiga is one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist,
 then he’s probably tied to Itachi who was with Kisame.
 Oh! And?
 Tell me, who's after Itachi?
 I know! Sasuke!
 That’s right!
 We can probably get the clue to Sasuke’s whereabouts
 at Katabami Gold Mine!
 But…
 If that’s what Guy Sensei said then…
 Don’t say anything rude!
 It's information that's 100% reliable!
 Starting now, while guarding Rokusuke and the others,
 we head toward Katabami Gold Mine
 to fulfill our mission to wipe out the Kurosuki family.
 There’s a shop I’m familiar with close to the gold mine.
 Let’s make that the base.
 What do you mean a shop you’re familiar with?
 That’s the fun part of the trip.
 That aside, that Naruto is late…
 If the source of the information is Guy Sensei,
 maybe he couldn’t quite trust it?
 That’s not true! Naruto will definitely come!
 That’s because Guy Sensei’s information is correct!
 Whatever.
 Here I am!
 We’re all here so…!
 Is that for you to say?!
 Let’s go!
 So…which way?
 Don’t be so anxious, Rokusuke,
 Those guys will save our town.
 It’s post-meal training!
 I won’t lose!
 I won’t lose!
 How long do you intend to rest here?!
 If we hurry, we can save Kanpachi from the burial…
 Give it up…
 How long do you think it’s been since that happened?
 It’s painful but…
 I remember…this sleepiness. The shop is close by.
 You say you’re sleepy, and are you walking in your sleep?!
 It’s okay.
 I slept while on a marathon on this road for three days straight.
 You are joking, right?
 It’s true.
 The track meet of my youth with Guy Sensei.
 My body still remembers it.
 I’ve gotten sleepy.
 Hey, Bushy Brow, are you really okay?
 That’s right. In this area, there’s the scent of spicy curry.
 Curry? Now that you mention it…
 That’s right!
 Over there, it’s… the Curry of Life Shop!
 Grandma Sansho!
 Oh my… 					Oh goodness!
 I haven’t seen you for a while!
 – Oh my my my! – You're looking well!
 This is the shop Lee is familiar with?
 That mountain is the Katabami Gold Mine
 Grandma Sansho’s curry saved my life.
 So you’re saying it’s delicious curry?
 No, it really saved my life. I’m indebted to this curry.
 It was when I’d just become a Genin …
 When Guy Sensei gave me a special training routine.
 Oh my, that’s right. I remember.
 Do your best!
 Oh my…
 Hey Grandma Sansho!
 Oh my, they’ve come again!
 Those people are running in their sleep.
 Karashi! Karashi!
 If you had that kind of energy, you wouldn’t lose to the bullies.
 Oh my, I might have said too much.
 Curry of Life Shop
 Oh my! It’s the third day.
 They’ve been running the whole time.
 Oh my. What a problem.
 I wonder if he’s hungry…?
 What a pickle! He's not waking up!
 Maybe I didn't use enough spice?
 Karashi…
 I’ve never seen a person who works this hard.
 Oh really… so you want to help this young man too…?
 This is the curry of life.
 Now! Grandma Sansho went to the trouble of making this curry.
 Let’s eat!
 I’m digging in!
 Yum! This is yummy-yum delicious!
 Delicious! The use of spices is wonderful!
 And this rice goes perfectly with the curry!
 Delicious!
 By the way, I don’t see Karashi.
 Karashi saw how hard you worked
 and became a bright kid full of energy, but…
 He got too much energy and left for town.
 What?
 I was wrong to keep telling him to be stronger.
 “I’m going to be a man!
 “I’m going to be part of the Kurosuki family,” he said.
 Oh my! I’m not blaming you. Don’t worry.
 It's too late.
 I’m responsible…
 Oh my.
 Neji!
 Please include Karashi’s rescue into our mission!
 We’ll bring him back from the road of evil!
 It’s fine.
 We’ll use this shop as a base and take a good look into the village.
 Then we’ll come up with a strategy and spring into action.
 Yes!
 You guys await orders here.
 Because it’s dangerous if the Kurosuki family finds us.
 It’s a disaster!
 Rokusuke! Rokusuke! He's gone!
 I’m sure he went to town alone!
 That’s not good!
 If those guys find Rokusuke…!
 Now that it’s come to this,
 we don’t have time to come up with a strategy!
 Let’s get right to it!
 No!
 We’ll get right to it!
 Let's hurry.
 Wait for me, Kanpachi, I’m coming now…
 Someone… is coming…
 Aw, again… I have to put on a funeral!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 You taught me that day.
 If you cook with great care,
 you can save someone’s life with just one serving of curry.
 Even for a person like me,
 with intense effort, it’s not an impossibility…
 That’s what I thought.
 You were far more admirable back then, Karashi.
 But…

158,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Battle at Sea:                      The Power Unleashed!!
 So you’re a monster too!
 You’re one to be acting you are above me!
 Take this!
 What?!
 Crap!
 This is bad!
 Naruto!
 I‘m counting on you…
 Naruto! Hang in there.
 Naruto!
 I-I’m okay…
 Isaribi… Thank you.
 Oh no!
 I’ll take the rest of your Chakra!
 Mind Destruction Jutsu!
 Impossible!
 Made it in time…
 What?!
 I see… It was you, huh?!
 The nerve of you to mess with me!
 Stop it, get away!
 Don’t turn your back to the enemy…!
 You forgot the ironclad rule of the fight…
 You lose!
 You saved me…
 That brat hit me with all his strength…
 And that Yoroi is no good either.
 I caught a huge fish!
 You mean you’re going to escape alone?
 We completed accommodating all the injured soldiers.
 Good work!
 What’s left is…
 Naruto and others, right?
 Of your numerous crimes…
 When we return to the village justice will be served,
 and it won’t be quick, so prepare yourself.
 It’s not over yet…
 You! I haven’t hit you enough yet!
 That’s too bad.
 What?!
 What…What’s going on?
 The Sea Monster doesn’t die. lt is immortal, that one!
 For the Sea Monster, this limitless seawater is its life…
 In the end, it will be your loss!
 Shut up!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 All right! I’m counting on you, Chief.
 Go clobber that flabby guy!
 Hey, Chief! We don’t have time for you to be so leisurely!
 That monster… Whack him in one go…
 That’s hot! Hot, hot!
 You got no business getting so motivated all by yourself!
 It itches, itches and I’m getting a rash all over my body!
 Wait, wait. Don’t come over here, Naruto!
 Damn him…
 I’m going to rip you apart when the mission is over!
 Remember that!
 Naruto! How are you going to settle this?!
 How can you say that, Chief Toad is the strongest frog!
 Please don’t let something like the saltwater bother you and fight.
 Humph! You can’t even control the summoned animal you called up!
 What was that?!
 If you don’t send him home quickly
 the Sea Monster will gulp him down and he’ll whither like a slug!
 A slug, he says?!
 Hey, Naruto! I’m going to kick your butt later…
 Right now, I’ll help you.
 Huh? F-For real?!
 Don’t mess with amphibians…
 I’ll show you my terror!
 Yeah! Now you're talking.
 Hang on!
 Wh-What the…?
 You rat… Let go of me, huh!
 What is this? He got you, Chief Toad!
 You be quiet!
 Upsy!
 This isn’t accomplishing anything…
 What’s up with that flabby bastard, really?
 In short, this is some kind of monster
 consisting of water gathered around its spiritual body at the core.
 Crap!
 I don’t really know what that means,
 but I guess I can’t do anything about that thing.
 Even though we pierce the monster with a dagger all we want,
 the monster will suck up ocean water and come back to life…
 Then what should we do, Chief Toad?!
 The only thing we can do here is
 to somehow damage the spiritual body at the “core.”
 Damage…? How?
 The opponent is a clump of water…
 Add heat and he’ll evaporate!
 The thoughts of fools mean nothing…
 The only thing you can do is to surrender to me, I who control the ocean!
 Damn. You’re annoying. Let’s go, Naruto!
 What? Go? Where are you going?!
 Airhead! I’ll spew oil!
 Huh?
 Light a fire with a Fire Style Jutsu!
 What?! I can’t do a Fire Style Jutsu!
 Here we go!
 What? Fire, fire, fire!
 How’s that?!
 What?!
 H-He did it… !
 Well done!
 Naruto…
 Im… Impossible!
 We did it, Chief Toad!
 How’s that!
 Chief Toad and me is the strongest combination, after all!
 Naruto! You’re in a festive mood all by yourself,
 though I’m wondering if you’ve forgotten about something?
 Huh? Forgotten what?
 You called me to a place like this…
 Look, now I’ve got all of these goose bumps!
 You’ve always had all those warts…
 Shut up! I’ll have you settle this properly!
 What?! Wha--? W-Wait Chief Toad! Wait!
 No use talking!
 It itches. I can’t take it!
 Something like this doesn’t soothe my feelings but,
 my sons have caused you inconvenience, so I forgive you this time.
 See you!
 I’m sorry, Chief Toad… Help me…
 Now that we also got rid of the Sea Monster, Amachi…
 You’ll be taken to the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 as the principle offender of the attacks on ships collecting funds.
 Shame! We had got kicked around because of you!
 What are you doing?! lsaribi, kill these guys!
 I won’t!
 Have you forgotten?
 I am the only person who can turn you back into a human!
 If I continue doing this,
 I’ll be a monster all the way to my heart!
 That’s right, Isaribi!
 You’re neither a human being nor fully integrated like me.
 The best you can do is to live the rest of your life as a monster
 for your whole life!
 Well, from the very start,
 I hadn’t thought of a way to turn you back into a human!
 Like I told you…
 I was intending to dissect you!
 No way…
 You!
 How rotten are you?!
 Stop it.
 Once we’ve returned to the village, he’ll be punished harshly.
 Well… It’s about time you told us.
 Where…did Orochimaru go?
 You think I know something like that?!
 You were tossed aside by Orochimaru.
 It serves you right to follow after him forever.
 You and I are different!
 I’ll be in charge of the research center
 and some day, will become an entity that’d bring Orochimaru to shame.
 Really…
 Just for yourself. Not fair!
 And now, mission completed. Let’s return to the island!
 Not fair. I’m also slug a good one before that.
 Stop it!
 That’s the Jiro Island Amachi was talking about…
 Here is the source of my nightmare…
 This place is where the fragments of my missing memories is left.
 Master Orochimaru… What in the world did you…?
 She’s alive…!
 She’s a lucky girl…
 After we tested ten, only one survived…
 I guess this experiment yielded little something before I take my leave.
 Leave…?
 Because it looks like there’s no reason to be here anymore…
 But, the research is still…
 That facility, do with it whatever you want.
 I have no need for it anymore…
 – Why…? How could you do this? – Why…? How could you do this?
 – I always respected you, yet you… – I always respected you, yet you…
 You’re lacking many things.
 Motivation to desire the “power”…
 Tenacity…
 Hatred…
 Everything!
 But, let’s see…
 I suppose just the fact that you survived
 might mean you have some value…
 Say? Do you want to come with me…?
 I see…
 I’ll find a better-gifted child then…
 It connected…
 So bright…
 I wasn’t cast aside…
 I, on my own…
 by my own will… chose it!
 Hey, hey, where did Sensei go?
 When I woke up this morning she wasn’t here…
 Will be right back!                             Anko 		Leaving behind only 		a note like this!
 Seriously… She sure is a fidgety person!
 What did you say? Who do you think you are?
 Whaddya mean?!
 What, you object?!
 Um…
 Really… Can I come with you?
 Don’t worry!
 There’s a very scary,
 but awesome Medical Ninja in Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 Yes, because Lady Tsunade is a medical specialist.
 That’s right, Lady Tsunade is amazing!
 Surely she’ll do something for you!
 Relax and let us take care of it.
 Thank you.
 Hey, all of you!
 What are you doing?! The boat will leave!
 When did you…!
 What were you doing?!
 We’ve been waiting for you this whole time, Sensei.
 Sorry, sorry…
 Wait! We’re getting on!
 Okay! We’re going home to the Leaf Village!
 No doubt, you are hyper from the start to the finish…
 Do you know what being tired is?
 Any problem?
 I’m praising you! I appreciate it!
 Huh? Really? You’re embarrassing me.
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Guarding a high-profile individual.
 Sure has a nice ring to it, believe it!
 Yeah! A mission has finally come that suits my ability!
 Just you wait, you great heir to a fortune!
 Now that I’ve taken this on, I’ll go through fire or water or…!
 Hey, what’s this?!
 Isn’t this just a D-rank mission with babysitting?
 Next time: “Impossible! Celebrity Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!”

159,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Sasuke here at Point B!
 Sakura here at Point C!
 Naruto here. I'm at Point A!
 You're slow, Naruto!
 Okay, the seventh squad…
 Hm?!
 The target has moved!
 Follow it!
 Alright! It's over there!
 What's your distance from the target?
 Five meters! I can go at anytime!
 I'm ready, too!
 Me, too…!
 Okay…
 Do it!
 Uryaaah!
 I got him!
 Does he have the ribbon on his right ear…?
 Are you sure it's our target Tora?
 It's the target, no mistake.
 Alright, the mission to capture lost pet ""Tora"" is complete!
 Isn't there a mission with a greater sense of urgency?!
 A Dangerous Mission! Journey to the Land of Waves!
 Ohhh! My cute Tora! I was worried to death!
 The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo (Feudal Lord) 		Madame Shijimi and Tora (the Cat)
 Serves him right, that stupid cat!
 No wonder he ran away…
 …Now, then!
 The next mission for Kakashi's seventh squad is…
 An errand to the neighboring town… to baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy…
 Helping with digging for potatoes, eh…
 Nooooo!
 No! No, thank you!
 As for me,
 I want to do like a more exciting mission!
 Give us something else!
 He's got a point…
 Man… He's a pain!
 I thought it was about time for him to get fretful…
 You fool! You're still bottom rookie!
 At the start,
 everyone moves up the ladder
 by gaining experience from simple missions!
 B-But!
 It's been nothing but blah missions so far!
 Knock it off!
 Naruto!
 It's necessary to explain to you what a mission is…
 Listen to me!
 Requests pour into the village every day.
 They range from babysitting to assassinations…
 A wide spectrum of requests are recorded on the request list…
 They are separated into A, B, C, and D ranks in order of difficulty.
 In the village, everyone below me
 is divided up by ability in the order of Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.
 We at the highest level distribute the requests as missions
 to Ninjas who have abilities that suit said mission.
 And, if the mission is successful, the fee comes in from the client.
 Nevertheless, you guys have just become Genin…
 rank D is about the best you can do…
 Hm?!
 Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone broth noodles,
 so today will be miso broth…
 Listen!
 I-I'm sorry.
 Maaaan! You always lecture me, old man!
 But I'm not that little prankster that you think I am!
 Humph!
 Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later…
 This kid who could only express himself with pranks…
 Okay, fine!
 Huh…?!
 If you insist…
 I'll have you do a Rank C mission…
 You'll be bodyguards for someone.
 Really?!
 Ah-ha!
 Who? Who?
 A feudal lord?!
 Or, a princess?!
 Don't get so hasty.
 I'll introduce you now!
 Could you please come in…?
 Huh…?!
 What's this? It's just a bunch of darned squirts!
 Huh…?
 Particularly you, the smallest one with the idiot face.
 Are you really a Ninja?
 Who's the smallest one with the idiot face he's talking about…?
 What?!
 I'll kill him!!
 What good will it do to kill the old man
 you're supposed to be guarding, you moron?!
 I'm Tazuna, veteran bridge builder.
 You'll be risking life and limb in guarding me to the max
 until I return to my land and complete my bridge!
 All right!
 We're off!!
 What're you so excited about?!
 You see, I've never left the village before!
 Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!
 I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him. There's no need to worry.
 ...okay with this squirt?!
 Anyone but this old dude, man…
 He's really the worst client!
 I'll tell him a thing or two…
 Hey, old man!
 Don't be mocking Ninjas so much!
 I'm awesome, you see!
 I'm a super-elite Ninja who will be called Hokage one day!
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki.
 Remember it well!!
 The Hokage's the super top-dog Ninja in the village, right?
 You sure as heck don't seem like you could become the Hokage…
 Aaah! Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to become the Hokage!
 You'll have no choice but to acknowledge me then!!
 I'll never acknowledge you, squirt…
 Even if you become the Hokage!
 What?! I'll kill you!
 I told you to stop it, you moron!
 No! At least let me have one shot, just one…
 Say…Mr.Tazuna…?
 What is it?
 Your country is  ""The Land of the Waves,""  right?
 What of it?
 Say, Kakashi Sensei…
 Are there Ninjas in that land, too?
 No, there aren't Ninjas in the Land of the Waves…
 But in other nations, while cultures and customs are different,
 hidden villages exist, and there are Ninjas there.
 To the many nations on the continent,
 the existence of Shinobi Villages is a measure of the nation's military strength.
 In other words,
 that is how these nations maintain their relationships with neighboring nations.
 Even so, the villages are not under the control of the nations.
 They are equal in rank.
 On a small island like the Land of the Waves,
 where it is difficult to be influenced by other nations,
 there is no need for a Shinobi village.
 Among the respective nations that possess a Shinobi Village,
 the five nations of ""Fire,"" ""Water,"" ""Lightning,"" ""Wind,"" and ""Earth,""
 due to their large territory and immeasurable power,
 are called the ""Five Great Nations.""
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves of the Land of Fire,
 the Village Hidden in the Mist of the Land of Water,
 the Village Hidden in the Clouds of the Land of Lightning,
 the Village Hidden in the Sand of the Land of Wind,
 the Village Hidden in the Rocks of the Land of Earth.
 Only the leaders of each of these Hidden Villages
 are allowed to have the name of Kage, the Shadow.
 The ""Hokage"" (Fire shadow),""
 ""Mizukage"" 					(Water Shadow),
 ""Raikage"" (Lightning Shadow),
 ""Kazekage"" 					(Wind Shadow),
 ""Tsuchikage"" (Earth Shadow),
 the so-called Five Kage (shadows),
 reign supreme over the tens of thousands of Ninjas
 in each nation of the whole world.
 No kidding… Lord Hokage is that incredible!
 I wonder if that blah old man is really that incredible…
 Sounds fishy!
 That can't be true! No way!
 Hey!
 You guys just doubted Lord Hokage now, didn't you…?
 Well…don't worry.
 There are no Ninja battles in Rank C missions.
 Then, there's no worry of getting into a scrape with foreign Ninjas…!
 Of course, not.
 What?!
 Huh?!
 W-What?
 The first one!
 K-Kakashi Sensei!
 The second one…
 The second one…
 Ohhh…!
 Hm?!
 It doesn't come off!
 W…Wow!!
 Whoa!
 Ugh!!
 They'll come!
 I have to do it… I have to!!
 Get back, sir!!
 Yo…
 Kakashi Sensei…! He's alive!
 Humph! 					Show off…
 Whaa--?!
 Then, what was that…?
 So Kakashi Sensei…used Substitutions…
 Naruto… Sorry I didn't help you right away…
 I got you hurt.
 I didn't think you'd be incapable of moving…
 I was saved, somehow…
 Anyhow, let me just say, good job, Sasuke.
 You, too, Sakura.
 I…couldn't do anything…
 but Sasuke…
 It was his first real battle…
 Didn't he feel scared, at all?
 He saved me like it was nothing and without getting any dirt on his clothes…
 Hey…
 Huh?!
 Are you hurt…
 scaredy cat...?
 Sasuke!
 Naruto!
 These guys have poison on their claws.
 You need to take out the poison quickly.
 What?!
 You have to open the wound and drain the poisoned blood.
 Don't move so much.
 The poison will spread.
 By the way, Mr. Tazuna…
 W-What is it…?!
 I have something to talk to you about.
 Chunin from the Village Hidden in the Mist…
 These guys are Ninjas known for continuing to fight
 no matter what the sacrifice.
 How were you able to detect our movements?
 There probably wouldn't be  puddles of water
 on a clear day like today, when it hasn't rained for days.
 Knowing that, why'd you leave it to the kids to fight?
 If I felt like it, I could kill these guys instantly…
 But… 					I had to know...
 who the target of these enemies was…
 Hm?! What do you mean?
 In other words...
 what I mean is I had to know if it was you,
 or one of us Shinobi… who was being targeted.
 We haven't heard anything about you being targeted by Ninjas.
 The content of the request was supposed to just be
 protection from gangs, thieves, and the like…
 This is a mission with a B rank or higher.
 The request was supposed to be
 for backup protection until you finished building your bridge…
 If our enemies were to be Ninjas,
 the mission would've been estimated without question
 as an expensive  ""B Rank""  mission.
 It appears there's some kind of good reason for this,
 but being lied to in the request won't do.
 This is beyond the scope of our mission.
 This mission is too soon for us…
 Let's give it up!
 We need an anesthetic to open Naruto's wound
 and get out the poisoned blood…
 We have to return to the village and take him to a doctor…
 Hmmm…
 Hm? What...?!
 This sure is a burden!
 Since we need to treat Naruto's wound, shall we go back to the village…?
 Huh!
 Oh!
 Why am I so different?!
 Why's it always me… Darn it!
 Naruto! What're you doing?!
 I should be getting stronger…
 Here I'm steadily carrying out missions and
 doing special-skill training by myself every day…
 I'll never get into another situation from which I'll have to be rescued.
 I'll never be afraid or a be a coward…
 I won't lose to Sasuke…
 I'm going to swear on the pain of my left hand!
 I'll protect you, old man… with this Kunai knife!!
 The mission continues!!
 Naruto…
 It's all well and good to rid yourself of the poisoned blood,
 but any more than that and you'll bleed to death.
 Things will get hairy if you don't stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!
 Yikes!
 Argh! No! No!
 I can't die like this, I say!
 Show me your hand.
 Nooo! Help me!!
 Naruto!
 You're really self-abusive, aren't you!
 That's masochistic!
 The wound is…
 already starting to heal…
 Um…um…
 Am I okay? You look awfully serious…
 Well…You should be okay.
 Is it…the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox…?
 Did you say you failed?!
 I paid a lot of money to hire you guys
 because you said you were once hot-shot Ninjas!
 Stop your darned grumbling…!!
 Next time, I'll kill him with this… head chopper!
 I-It's really okay, right?!
 It seems that the enemy has hired good Ninjas…
 On top of that, a tightened guard on account of the Demon Brothers' failure
 means that it won't be easy…
 Just who do you think I am?!
 This Zabuza Momochi, who is called the demon of…
 the Hidden Mist!!
 We've finally landed ashore in the Land of the Waves.
 The guys before were all well and good,
 but there should be even stronger guys lying in wait.
 Okay! I'm going to regain my honor and continue the mission.
 No matter what enemy comes,
 I'll protect the old man this time around for sure.
 Oh, they wasted no time.
 An impressive-looking guy with a huge Katana has come.

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart

 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,

 Heh… Well…
 It’s a drag, but it’s Lady Tsunade’s orders.
 Old Lady Tsunade’s…?
 You’re pursuing Mizuki, right?
 Y-Yeah…!
 And…who are these guys here?
 Fujin and Raijin.
 Fujin…and Raijin?
 Yeah. They’re a little weak upstairs, but their brute strength…
 is Herculean, surpassing even that of the Legendary Sannin.
 Are you serious?
 Damn… It looks like he really means it.
 Pretty amazing that they are able to hold out
 against the Shadow Possession Jutsu only by using their strength…
 It looks like this is gonna turn into a troublesome situation again…
 Leave this to us… You go pursue Mizuki!
 We’ll be fine!
 Leave it to us!
 Awright!
 But be careful!
 Those guys are crazy like monsters!
 Yeah… I can see that.
 Go, Naruto!
 Thanks, guys!
 We better hurry, Naruto!
 Your opponents are this way!
 You guys… Doing this kind of thing to us brothers!
 Don’t even think we’re gonna let you leave here alive!
 Well… I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
 Choji! Ino! Let’s hurry and take care of these guys!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!

 Wait, Mizuki!
 Looks like I’m gonna have a little fun, Iruka!
 This way?
 Mizuki! Where are you?
 D-Damn!
 This is Genjutsu…
 Release!
 After Genjutsu… Puppets come, huh?
 His Jutsu are diverse.
 And moreover, the timing of his Jutsu are superb…
 I was really close to   being taken down…
 I wouldn’t have imagined that
 he could have such full command of the high level Jutsu…that Mizuki.
 I guess I can praise you on catching that the Puppet was real.
 However… I wonder how long
 you’re gonna be able to continue to engage in my game, Iruka!
 Where’s this…?!
 This ain’t good…
 They’re able to repel Shadow Possession Jutsu
 using only their strength…
 Shikamaru, I’ll go!
 Choji!
 Stop it! Their strength is unearthly!
 I’ll hold this guy down…
 While I do that take care of the other one!
 Okay! All right, let’s go, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 Ninja Art: Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 What’s the matter, Elder Brother?
 A success!
 Oops…
 All right!
 Formation, Ino-Shika-Cho completed!
 Elder Brother! What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
 Iruka Sensei… I’ll catch up with you in no time…
 Please be safe!
 How do you like my Jutsu, Iruka?
 Pretty good for being self-taught, wouldn’t you say?
 I can’t understand…
 You have the ability to use such high-level Ninjutsu to this degree…
 why would you waste it?!
 As always, trying to impose your morals on me, huh…?!
 You’re so lukewarm! You’re so naïve!
 Don’t you start preaching me!
 I won’t acknowledge you, no matter what!
 I consistently hardened my heart and carried out my missions…
 Despite that, those guys in the village…
 No matter how strong I was!
 No matter how many enemies I took down in my missions!
 Those guys didn’t even attempt to acknowledge me!
 Saying we’re comrades, it’s all about teamwork…
 They were all bound by stupid rules!
 His target’s the Secret Manuscript.
 Backup Mizuki!
 Right!
 Hey! Are you all right?!
 I-I can’t feel my leg…
 What do you think, Mizuki?
 It’s no good. lt’s unfortunate, but he can no longer…
 I see…
 All right! Let’s withdraw!
 Hurry!
 Yeah…
 It’s unfortunate, but…
 Guys who are of no use on the battleground
 only become a ball and chain…
 Even though it’s just a minor injury,
 you won’t be able to move from this place…
 If you’re wanna blame someone,
 I suggest you blame your own helpless self!
 I simply carried out my mission faithfully.
 And despite that, those guys in the village…
 Not one of them even attempted to acknowledge me…
 Why?! Why didn’t anybody acknowledge my strength?!
 Why?! Iruka…!
 When you and even that Nine-Tailed brat are acknowledged, why only me…?
 It’s still not too late.
 If you pay for your crimes and start afresh,
 the people in the village will certainly…
 How cocky! Don’t preach to me!
 You’re just the same as those other guys in the village!
 You disdain me, don’t you?!
 Mizuki…
 Everything…
 That’s right… Everything began that day…
 What are you gonna do, getting nervous now?
 Mizuki…
 It finally takes place tomorrow, doesn’t it?
 The Academy’s teacher recruitment exam…
 Yeah… It’s weighing heavily on me.
 I’m envious of you. Your scores are better than mine.
 You’ll breeze right through tomorrow’s exam.
 Not quite… Well, in any case, let’s both do our best!
 Yeah!
 Damn!
 Lie low!
 That was close, Iruka!
 Yeah…
 Mizuki… Thank you. You really helped me out!
 It’s mutual… Come on, let’s hurry!

 Number 7 - Iruka Umino
 I-I did it…
 I did it!
 Mizuki…

 Now then, regarding Mizuki… we will adopt a wait-and-see attitude.
 Yes, it can’t be helped.
 I agree… The questions that were raised
 at the time of that mission to recover the Secret Manuscript…
 Until those are completely cleared up… lt can’t be helped, can it?
 According to the autopsy report…
 the cause of death to that corpse was given as suffocation.
 In Mizuki and the others’ reports,
 it stated that the leg injury was not that serious…
 I understand…
 He’s brilliant but it can’t be helped.
 I was just carrying out the mission that I was assigned to do!
 Can you understand how miserable the life I've led has been since then?!
 Huh? Iruka?!
 You have no idea, do you?
 I have undergone so many hardships,
 and you, who has had it so easy…
 Which one of us is the true Shinobi…
 Let’s clarify that once and for all, shall we?!
 Now then come! Iruka!
 Mizuki… Where are you?!
 You don’t have any intention of reforming yourself, do you?!
 Don’t make me say the same thing over and over again!
 Then I’ll bring this to an end now…
 It’s very unfortunate, though!
 What a tearjerker…
 It makes me happy too, Iruka…
 Elder Brother?! What’s the matter, Elder Brother?!
 Hey… You came back, Elder Brother!
 Uh, Elder Brother?
 What did you guys do to… to Elder Brother?!
 I hijacked him! Idiot!
 Wh-What the heck…?!
 What?!
 Elder Brother! Get up! Wake up!

 Owww…!
 Are you okay, Ino?
 I-I think I’m…
 not okay! My gorgeous face is…!
 Good grief… Gimme a break…
 C-Choji!
 Choji!
 Are you okay?!
 I-I’m fine…
 Sorry… Feels like I fell asleep a little.
 Hey, Elder Brother… You woke up.
 Damn. Can’t be helped…
 Guess I have no choice but to use that thing.
 Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Elder Brother…!
 H-How dare you!
 We’re close. Mizuki may have set a trap so be careful!
 I know that!
 It was so much fun to be behind bars…
 The moldiness… The dampness… The gloominess…
 Pitch black year round!
 But for that very reason that I was able master techniques
 that an ordinary Shinobi would not be able to possess…
 Even in this darkness…
 I can get an intense sense of your energy…
 What’s the matter? Are you done already?
 There’s no time to be spaced out, Iruka.
 I’m gonna take my time and have fun with this…
 Take my time, got it?
 All right! Me too!
 Wait! If you go in there right now using Mind Transfer Jutsu,
 my Jutsu will affect you too!
 If you think you’re the only one who’s learned a new Jutsu,
 you’re very wrong!

 R-Raijin… What are you doing?!
 Heh… Not bad…

 That’s it! That building!
 All right! Just one last spurt!
 How about it? Have your eyes adjusted a little?
 For guys like you who have lived their lives in the light,
 darkness is an inconvenience, isn’t it?
 Damn! Where are you?!
 Hey, Iruka, weren’t you saying that
 you were going to bring this to an end ?
 I see! By end,
 you must have been talking about yourself, huh?!
 Heh! Just a little bit!
 Hang in there, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 Damn…!
 Damn! Unbelievable idiot strength!
 Th-Those jerks…
 I-I can’t hold them any longer!
 If we put a stop to the Jutsu right now, everything will go to waste…
 Think… Think about the next move…
 Bear with it, Ino!
 Leave it to me!
 You’re just gonna be sent flying again!
 Ino, just be quiet and watch!
 Even the big-boned guy can make quite a showing once he decides to do it!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu!
 Both Hands!

 Finer and smaller…

 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 No way! What happened to lruka Sensei?!
 The scent ends here.
 In any case, we just have to search the perimeter.
 Everything is in pieces. Damn it!
 Please be safe, Iruka Sensei!
 Hush! Be quiet, Naruto!
 We have a company.
 It seems someone is after us.

 I struggled for decades… after leaving the village.
 You’re a truly frightening, inhuman monster!
 So, he did it, huh…?
 The reason I couldn’t select you to be the Fourth Hokage…
 is because of that distorted consciousness.
 I’ve finally been found out, eh…?
 It’s too bad.
 Orochimaru… What’s the meaning of this?!
 Here I’d set that many booby traps…
 so I was quite surprised.
 But I see… So it was you.
 Recently, there has been a steady stream of people going missing from the village,
 from Genin to Chunin, and even Anbu Black Ops members.
 There was also information that you had been acting strange…
 Master Orochimaru…
 Why did a Shinobi of your rank do such a thing?
 Shall I kill you, too?
 Orochimaru! Sure enough, this was your doing…?
 Say it! What were you doing here?!
 Alas! I’ve been found out.
 There’s no point in acting cute…
 It’s for Jutsu development!
 Orochi… You!
 For that purpose, you did this to fellow Shinobi…?!
 As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh…
 What is it that you want?
 I want everything!
 Everything, you say?!
 Get every Jutsu and understand all of the truths of this world!
 The one who first mixed blue and yellow
 named the new color made in that way, green.
 I just want to do the same thing.
 If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign…
 and green is a Jutsu.
 In the same way that there are no limits to the kinds of colors,
 there are probably also tens of thousands of Jutsu in this world…
 But in order to get any and all of the Jutsu…
 as well as the truths, a long time is necessary.
 It’s the one who takes those long years to know everything,
 who can suitably be called the ultimate individual.
 For me, the life span of the body is too short.
 Too fleeting.
 Even if I were to be called the Hokage, if I die, it all ends there.
 Orochimaru… Could it be that the Jutsu you’re testing here is…
 Right… It sure could be…
 Immortality Jutsu!
 Immortality Jutsu is a technique of
 eternally pooling one’s own spirits into this earth…
 In other words, it’s a Revival Jutsu where…
 you find a new body, put your own spirit into that body and take it over.
 I assumed my old form until now,
 so that you would feel nostalgic about our reunion…
 Aging is an empty thing, isn’t it?
 I feel that keenly when I look at you.
 You’ll die here…
 and I’ll get a younger, more beautiful and stronger body…
 The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun…
 I get it… You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!
 Right… Exactly… Sasuke.
 A Reviving Jutsu where someone else’s body is stolen
 and the spirit is immortalized, huh?
 How many faces and bodies have you gone through?!
 Two, I think…
 I plan to take Sasuke over after raising him a little more to my liking.
 But after all, in order to make you regret your very own life…
 and curse destiny as you die…
 …perhaps this face is better?
 You monster!
 Lord Hokage!
 Don’t lower your guard, Sensei! You’re always too soft…
 What’s been wrong with you? This isn’t like you!
 I’m sorry…
 Eyes…
 Eyes with malice and ambition concealed in them…
 I had noticed that you had such tendencies.
 I had noticed, but pretended not to know.
 It was still during the war-torn era.
 A genius who brimmed over strongly with ability…
 Nothing less than a phenomenon that comes once in several decades.
 So I wanted to think that
 you would carry on my own will and power.
 That softness on my part…
 created the conditions of that time as well as now!
 Are you going to…kill me?
 Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!
 I wonder if you can… Sarutobi Sensei!
 Kill him, Sarutobi! Now’s your only chance!
 Sarutobi… You…
 I couldn’t kill him…
 I’ll bury you and correct my old mistakes, now!
 Here I go!
 It’s too late!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 No way! Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 To disperse the little Chakra he has left…!
 You’ve gotten old, after all…
 To think you’d shorten your own life span out of impatience…
 D-Don’t tell me, you…?!
 Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi…
 This order of Signs…
 I knew it, Sarutobi, you are using that Jutsu!
 So this is the Grim Reaper the Fourth Hokage was talking about,
 which only the one who has signed a contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!
 Whatever you do now, it’s too late… I’ve won.
 The Leaf Village will crumble!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is the home where I live.
 The Hokage exists as the pillar to protect that home!
 The Hokage is the one who inherits and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.
 I won’t go easily!
 Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!
 Stupid nonsense…
 You’re merely a temporal head
 in the history of the organization called the Leaf Village…
 Even the face rock that is left will eventually weather and decay.
 Humph… Leaf Village is not just an organization to me!
 In the Leaf Village,
 every year many Shinobi are born and raised…
 and live and fight… and die to protect the village.
 The people of this village…
 even if they don’t have blood ties…
 To me, they are precious…
 precious…
 family!
 Then I shall smash you, the pillar, and destroy the Leaf home.
 Humph! Even if you kill me, that pillar will not break!
 I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will of the First and Second Hokages…
 The Third Hokage!
 No matter how much you target this Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 A new Hokage will carry on my will, shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!
 Right, Fourth Hokage?
 Orochimaru! Now I will perform an ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!
 Behold! Sealing Jutsu! Reaper Death Seal!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Every year in this village,
 Shinobi are born, nurtured, and fight for the sake of the village.
 They live to protect the village and things that are precious to them.
 Even if they aren’t related to me, they are my precious family.
 I won’t let you have your way with my family!

 An enema?
 Boom.
 Sasuke…?
 That was a splendid blow.
 D-Did that get him?
 Gaara…
 Doing all that work… And managing just one blow, huh?
 S-Shut up!
 He attacked the base of the tail which has the weakest defense…
 Even though I’m not wounded, I can’t absorb the impact.
 Did I underestimate him too much?
 Hey, Naruto…
 Sakura… Go rescue her if it’s the last thing you do!
 And after you’ve rescued her…
 take Sakura and lose no time in fleeing.
 You, if anyone, can do it!
 Sasuke… You…
 I still have the ability… to hold him in check for a while.
 If things end here…
 it would just mean that was the extent of the man I am.
 I lost everything once…
 I don’t want to see…
 any precious comrades die right before my eyes again.
 Precious…comrades…
 I will not allow my comrades…
 to be killed, no matter what.
 I see…
 That’s right.
 Because he resembles me…
 Because he has gone through life
 with the same loneliness and sadness as I have…
 That guy who continued to fight in solitude for himself,
 I thought…he was strong.
 Naruto…
 But that’s not the meaning of true strength…
 If one fights just for oneself in solitude…
 one can’t really become strong…
 Is there someone who is precious to you?
 When a person wants to protect someone who is precious to him…
 it’s then that they truly… become…strong.
 You will…become strong.
 He’s releasing such massive amount of Chakra!
 That’s…Naruto?!

 Not you again! What in the world do you want?
 Huh?!
 That must be… the Shukaku of the Sand.
 Chief Toad! Come join me in this fight!
 No way!
 What?!
 Why would I go out of my way and fight a guy like that?
 That’s idiotic!
 Why?!
 You told me the other day that you would make me your henchman!
 It’s only natural for a chief to help out his henchman!
 That’s respect and duty, right?!
 It’s true I told you I’d make you my henchman…
 But we haven’t even exchanged cups of sake to seal our relationship yet…
 Gimme a break! I’m still underage!
 I can’t drink alcohol!
 Don’t say that and just listen to what this guy says, Pop!
 Huh?! Pop?!
 Why are you here, Gamakichi?
 I had lots of time on my hands, so I came to visit…
 Huh? Huh? You’re father and son?
 Then that guy over there tried to bully me!
 What was that?!
 When that happened, this guy here rescued me…
 He clashed with that monster…
 Pretty interesting guy.
 I see…
 Kid… I recognize you as my henchman…
 and I’ll show you what duty and respect means!
 I’ll make you pay the price good and proper, you underling!
 Hang on tight!
 How’s that?!
 Awesome…
 What a guy…
 He’s so heavy,
 I could barely manage to thrust my dagger through him.
 If I don’t hurry up,
 this battle will change the shape of the landscape.
 Hey! Hey! Chief!
 Sakura is over that way, so don’t move that way!
 Please lure him in this direction.
 Sakura…?
 That’s his girlfriend, Pop.
 I’ve got to take that guy down.
 Otherwise, I won’t be able to rescue Sakura!
 Interesting!
 This is interesting! Naruto Uzumaki!
 T-This isn’t good!
 That Gaara… He’s intending to do that thing.
 I better get out of here!
 Huh…? That is…
 That’s…the medium…?
 To thank you for entertaining me up to now…
 I’ll show you the real power…
 of the Sand Spirit!
 The circles under his eyes…
 Those are symptoms of insomnia which indicate
 that the medium is also possessed by the Shukaku of the Sand.
 Insomnia…?
 Those who are possessed by the Demon Raccoon Shukaku
 are unable to sleep soundly through the entire night.
 Because of the terror…
 If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowly eat away at their personality
 and eventually that person is no longer himself.
 Because he normally doesn’t get much sleep…
 the medium’s personality tends to…become unstable.
 Oh…
 Therefore, usually while the medium is awake,
 the power of Shukaku is normally controlled.
 However…
 when that medium sleeps…
 Playing Possum Jutsu!
 He’s done it…!
 W-What’s gonna happen, Chief?
 If one sets Playing Possum Jutsu into motion…
 …the Shukaku will appear!
 I’m finally able to emerge!
 That’s the Shukaku?
 He’s pretty funky…
 Right away! The guy I wanna kill! You!
 I’m gonna jump…
 Huh?
 Wind Style: Air Bullets!
 Water Style: Water Bullets!
 That’s practically a storm…
 What kind of a battle is this…?!
 Chief! I told you, not in that direction!
 Shut up! I know!
 Air Bullets!
 Water Bullets!
 Too bad…
 This isn’t good, Chief! There's one shot left…!
 Yeah! I killed it…
 I killed it!
 That hurts…!
 How dare you shoot me
 with bullets containing stupid amounts of Chakra!
 Even I can’t take that many shots!
 What should we do?!
 For a start, wake up that medium kid!
 It will release that Jutsu!
 How do we go about waking him?!
 Give him a good punch!
 Water Bullets!
 Like I’ll take that!
 Now!
 Chief, I can’t hit him unless you hold him down!
 This Toad doesn’t have fangs or claws to hold that guy’s movement.
 What should we do then?!
 We’ll use the Transform Jutsu to change into something that has those!
 But with that said…
 I’m not particularly good at transformations.
 Huh?
 So you will act as my will and make the Sign!
 Whaaaat?!
 Time for a combined transformation!
 Uh…Okay!
 We got to have fangs and claws!
 Umm…
 Let’s go!
 Wait… Say, w-wait a second…!
 F- Fangs and claws… Fangs and claws… Fangs and claws!
 Transform!
 Transform Jutsu!
 That’s the…!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 I don’t know about your past, and my past doesn’t matter either!
 I only have people who I must protect.
 Hey you with no eyebrows!
 Let’s just end this as similar fighters.
 I will finish this with my next hit.
 This will be, absolutely and totally, the last one!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Damn!
 Pretty impressive…
 You timed it well to scatter the three to attack.
 You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?
 Since it is a pretty complicated song…
 Well…
 Not only did you immediately understand
 that I’m manipulating these guys with my flute
 but you understood how difficult this song is.
 You’re a pretty impressive punk.
 But you can’t completely understand this song.
 True… Since art is so foreign to me.
 But since she uses that flute to manipulate,
 it means that song must contain individually specific sound patterns
 to control each and every movement of those guys…
 I’m pretty confident when it comes to just analyzing,
 but this time it’s not looking good.
 The reason is…
 I don’t understand musical notes whatsoever.
 Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!
 I’ll specially show you the Camellia Dance next.
 I’ll crush you!
 You shouldn’t say things you can’t even do.
 Shut up!
 What?!
 I told you.
 This bone is harder than steel.
 You should have a taste of it with your own body.
 Damn!
 There’s no one that’s heard this song and lived.
 Finale, Ninth Passage, Demon Revolution!
 The melody’s changed!
 Something’s gonna come!
 What the--?!
 What?
 This is…?
 The speed at which he flees after determining
 that these Material Ghosts are dangerous…
 Pretty impressive.
 But…
 I’ve used my precious Paper Bombs and Smoke Bombs all at once
 and all I could do was hide.
 That white one…
 bit off my physical energy.
 Seeing that shuriken passed through,
 that thing is semi-materialistic with very little mass.
 It's Chakra itself with an appetite.
 It’s probably Chakra that’s shaped mostly by mental energy.
 That’s why it seeks stability and craves for physical energy.
 If I continue dealing with those “Hungry Chakra”
 I won’t be able to build up my Chakra.
 They’re pretty dangerous.
 She’s a Shinobi who can make special Chakra like me…
 It’s without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.
 Which means I should leave the white thing alone
 and aim for the main body!
 The quickest way would be to stop the sound of the flute, but…
 it’d be impossible to get close to that woman in this situation.
 The next thing would be to capture those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 But that's difficult too since they’re attacking me separately at different times.
 If I let even one escape I’d be attacked and it’d be the end…
 There aren’t any openings in either offense or defense this woman…
 Heh! She might be a pretty good Shogi player.
 My remaining Ninja tools are twelve kunai knives,
 nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire, one Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb…
 Man…
 I feel like I’m playing without rooks or bishops.
 Did I lose them?
 I guess that’s not possible…
 Akamaru?
 Here. Eat this, Akamaru.
 If you don’t eat you won’t get your strength back.
 All right. Akamaru, let’s go!
 There’s the issue of those guys too…
 Dance of the Camellia!
 There’s no use hiding.
 Unless you can predict these guys’ movements
 there’s nowhere you can run, little rat.
 I’ll find you and break you into pieces right away!
 Now then...
 All right. Everything’s ready. All that remains is to do it.
 There’ll be nine attacks.
 The outcome will be decided during the attacks.
 One!
 One!
 Wishful thinking!
 The Jutsu manipulated by this sound is invincible.
 Whatever plans you have to win against me…is useless!
 Two!
 Scampering around, you little rat! Where are you?!
 Three!
 So you’re over there!
 Four!
 So it’s a cheap trick. You think you can make a fool of me?!
 Five…six…
 seven…eight…
 Scurrying around to get away. What is he thinking?
 Light?!
 Nine!
 Oh no!
 He’s lengthened the shadows with light and …
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu… a success!
 That’s impossible…
 How were you able to predict these guys’ movements?!
 There’s no way you could have heard the differences in my music patterns!
 I wasn’t listening to the sounds at all.
 There’s something other than the sounds
 that give away your command patterns, isn’t there?
 Your fingers!
 It can’t be!
 The movement of the three...
 Are you saying you memorized my finger movements and predicted?
 There’s no way that’s possible!
 Your right index finger and ring finger…
 The sound that you make with those
 along with the left middle finger and pinkie,
 that middle crab pincher man stands ready.
 Your right thumb and index finger,
 and your left index finger and pinkie, the club man charges.
 While you were dodging my attacks and looking for me,
 I was observing each and every one of your finger moves in detail…
 analyzing and memorizing them.
 It’s no use…
 They’re bound by Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 The most interesting rule of the Shogi play is that
 you can use pieces you obtain as your own pieces.
 From here on out… it’s my turn to attack…
 This time I’ll hunt you down using the three pieces.
 You’re looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you that there hasn’t been a person
 who’s heard the sound of this flute and lived, idiot!
 That’s some confidence!
 Retreat!
 Too bad you aren’t able to use the pieces, hey!
 Next it’s my turn!
 What?!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu, successful.
 I told you.
 That I’d hunt you down using the pieces.
 I used the three pieces as bait.
 In attacking, the first hand is the trick, a fake.
 The basics are to score with the second hand.
 Bastard…
 It can’t be helped.
 Now that it’s come to this I’ll need to force out with power.
 I didn’t think that I’d get to second state in a place like this…
 It ticks me off but…
 I’ll acknowledge it.
 This guy was a pretty impressive scum.
 What is…this?
 It’s true you’re somewhat sharp, but…
 It won’t go as you’ve planned from here!
 What?!
 Is she gonna force herself out of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?
 What’s with that tremendous Chakra?
 The Jutsu’s gonna come loose!
 I can’t be worrying about saving Chakra anymore.
 There’s no other way but to use that Jutsu!
 Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
 Is he grabbing my body with the shadow?
 It’s just as if I’m being grabbed by a real hand…
 But, no more than this!
 Damn! What an incredible strength.
 At this distance I’ll lose to that strength!
 Take this!
 Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!
 This is bad!
 Is this a…Genjutsu?
 Where are you aiming?
 I can’t move my body…
 While in second stage,
 I manipulate many Genjutsu with my flute.
 Of those, this one is an appropriate for that little rat.
 The reason is…
 This Genjutsu stops the movement of the prey and ties it up!
 How’s that? How’s it feel to be the one tied up?
 So this was your last move huh? Unfortunately, it’s a return checkmate!
 Little rat!
 What…?
 This guy...
 He broke his own finger with his own shadow!
 Did he release the Genjutsu with that pain?
 On top of that, he kept pretending to be bound by the Jutsu?!
 I told you this already
 that the first hand is the trick, a fake.
 The basics are to score with the second move.
 Moreover this second move… it’s a little different from earlier.
 With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,
 the closer in distance you are to the subject the stronger the hold.
 Damn. I carelessly got too close…
 No, that’s not it.
 The most careless thing was the words you said earlier,
 “my weapon is just the flute.”
 You’re looking pretty composed.
 Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.
 My weapon is just this flute!
 I told you that there hasn’t been a person
 who’s heard the sound of this flute and lived, idiot!
 No way…
 That’s right.
 The reason I threw the kunai knife right in front of you and missed…
 was to lead you to pick it up and come closer to me, you see?
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 No way, that’s ridiculous!
 Am I having a dream or something?!
 But it’s too intense to be a dream!

 All right!
 I’m going to do my best again today!
 Oh! Bushy Brow!
 Oh… Good morning, Naruto.
 Hey, hey, did you already get checked out by Old Lady Tsunade?
 How was it, how was it?
 The Leaf Village is in great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 You’re right.
 Bushy Brow, you should get better as soon as possible
 and succeed in your mis--!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 What’s the matter?
 It’s Konohamaru!
 Huh? What’s wrong with Konohamaru?
 He’s in trouble.
 In trouble?!
 The Will of Fire Still Burns
 At this rate, we will have to open it by force.
 Try it! Who do you think I am?!
 I am the grandson of the Third Hokage!
 If you go against me, then…
 It means you’re going against the Hokage!
 We need Lady Tsunade to assume her position immediately.
 Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!
 You'll get something even more terrible if you come close to me.
 Honorable grandson! Even for you…
 There are things that can and cannot be forgiven!
 Shut up!
 What is all this commotion so early in the morning?
 It’s hurting my head.
 Lady Tsunade…
 It's just one kid… What're you doing?
 Yes…
 Get rid of him!
 But it’s the grandson of the Third Hokage!
 It doesn’t matter if he’s the grandson or the great grandson.
 I am the granddaughter of the First Hokage!
 He might just open his eyes if he gets roughed up a little.
 Now move it!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 Wait!
 Naruto?!
 Hey, hold on there.
 I don’t really know what's going on,
 but don’t be so rough with Konohamaru, Old Lady Tsunade.
 An acquaintance of yours?
 Yes, yes…
 I’ll do the convincing, leave it to me.
 Then, do something by the end of the day!
 Oh, Lady Tsunade… Please wait!
 Excuse me.
 Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has already been discharged from the hospital.
 I’m actually here to see Lee today. ls he in the rehabilitation room?
 Not yet. That’s not like him to be late.
 I see.
 The probability of a successful surgery is 50%, at best.
 And if it fails, you'll die!
 Hey, Konohamaru. What are you doing in there?!
 Hurry up and come out. Then let’s go eat some ramen.
 Don’t worry. It’s on me!
 You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!
 All right! You can have eggs too! How about that!
 At least answer me!
 Shut up, you fool!
 You called me a fool!
 Open up already! I’ll break in! Hey!
 Try if you can!
 W-Why you--!
 – Naruto… 					– Naruto!
 Oh, Lee… You’re here.
 S-Sakura!
 I wanted to bring you this.
 F-For… me?
 Th-Thank you very much!
 I-I’m sorry, Sakura.
 No worries.
 Sasuke is now recuperating at home.
 Thanks to Lady Tsunade.
 At this rate,
 seems like he’ll be able to get back to his duties very soon.
 I see. That’s very good.
 Lady Tsunade is great, after all.
 I think if you had her take a look, you’d get better very quickly.
 Yes…
 But if there is something that I can do,
 please feel free to tell me.
 Thank you very much, Sakura.
 Then I’ll see you soon.
 I would think that at least one bar would be open.
 There’s no way. What time do you think it is right now?
 I can’t drink sake, and I can’t gamble.
 This place, the Hidden Leaf Village, is no fun at all.
 Just like the Third Hokage.
 Lady Tsunade!
 Oh, I’m tired.
 I just want to sit down and have a drink somewhere.
 I understand.
 I will take you to a place where you can sit and have a drink.
 What?
 But I will have you do your work!
 Here now, go ahead. It’s hot.
 Shizune…you’ve suddenly become very strict!
 I haven’t gotten strict. lt’s probably that you were not aware.
 Not aware?!
 “If I can’t get in the room, then I don’t have to work.”
 Isn’t that what you were thinking?
 And that’s why you left it up to Naruto.
 Humph! Could be…
 This is the most recent list of Ninja.
 The names and lineups of the groups have changed a lot.
 So please look through them. And I mean, look through all of it!
 Oh bother.
 They have sweet rice cakes, too.
 I don’t like sweet things!
 Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!
 At least tell me why you’re doing this!
 Konohamaru!
 Darn!
 Everybody came here because they’re worried about you!
 If you don’t come out, I’m going to drag you out of there!
 Naruto Sacred Technique...
 Sexy Jutsu!
 Konohamaru, come out!
 Konohamaru, hurry!
 Hey! Say something at least! This is so embarrassing!
 Don’t fool around with me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 – Stop it already, Konohamaru! – Stop it already, Konohamaru!
 One, two…
 – Uh, what is this? – What the--?!
 What's going on?!
 Are you okay? Naruto?
 This is the Old Man’s room.
 Eight D-rank missions, three C-rank missions…
 I see, very much like the Kurenai team.
 We can easily figure out what the Third Hokage was thinking.
 This is the same as their parents’ team.
 I see.
 Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty and is well-balanced.
 My shoulders are stiff.
 I’m going to go get some fresh air outside.
 Success…
 Success…
 Naruto…
 Uh… Darn!
 If that’s how you’re going to be, then I’m not going to go easy on you.
 This is the Old Man’s room!
 I won’t let anybody use this room besides him!
 The Old Man’s…?
 That’s why, as his grandson, I’m going to protect it!
 Fool! This isn’t the time for that!
 The Leaf Village is in great danger!
 So what?! It doesn’t matter to me.
 Are you seriously saying that?!
 Oh, now I’m mad!
 And I can easily tear down one or two doors with my new powers--!
 – Naruto! 					– Naruto!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 Oh! Watch out!
 W-Wow…
 Listen Konohamaru.
 The Hidden Leaf Village is in great trouble right now!
 Our forces have dropped to almost half, and we have to finish our missions!
 That’s what I taught you!
 Yeah… um… well…
 But if we don’t accomplish our missions,
 that’s letting other countries know that the village has been weakened.
 That’s what Iruka Sensei taught you!
 Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?
 It’s not that! lt’s not that at all.
 Then what is it?
 Soon, nobody will call me honorable grandson.
 Then I’ll just become plain old Konohamaru.
 So what’s wrong with plain old Konohamaru?
 No…
 Why, why?! You hated being called honorable grandson!
 Everybody’s going to forget about the Old Man.
 The Old Man.
 They’re going to forget what a great Ninja he was,
 they’re just going to put him away like an old ashtray.
 The new Hokage will make all kinds of changes in the Leaf Village.
 That’s not true!
 The Hidden Leaf Village is the Hidden Leaf Village.
 And besides, nobody will forget about the Old Man!
 No! They will never forget about him!
 They will forget, I guarantee it.
 They won’t forget!
 That’s a lie!
 It’s not a lie! You can’t believe what I am saying?!
 That’s right, I can't!
 Oh boy!
 Come with me, Konohamaru!
 We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade to promise
 that she won’t change the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 And then on top of that,
 we can get everybody to promise us that they won’t forget about the Old Man!
 What?
 Isn’t that what you want?
 I can’t believe that I let Lady Tsunade out of my sight!
 Did you find her, Tonton?
 Revitalizing the cells, I see.
 I’ve found you Lady Tsunade.
 What?
 Lady Tsunade is studying?!
 Be quiet! I can’t concentrate.
 Concentrate?!
 I’ve never heard you use that word except when you're gambling.
 Is that Shizune’s voice?
 Shizune…
 Do you remember that Medical Ninja by the name of Kabuto?
 What about him?
 His ability to create new cells.
 I was researching ways to use that power on the patients.
 For Lee?
 If the 50% chance becomes 51%, it’s worth a try.
 It really depends on the individual’s traits.
 Even for you, it might be hard to acquire those powers.
 I’ll just have to try.
 I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.
 I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 If you don’t like it, you should just quit!
 Everybody from the village is my family.
 To protect the family, that is the duty of a Hokage.
 Oh! Old Man!
 Just for today, I’m making a special exception.
 What’s the matter Konohamaru?
 Don’t you want to see Old Lady Tsunade?
 No.
 I’ll just have to do it. I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped, Konohamaru. I am the Third Hokage, after all.
 It can’t be helped. I am the honorable grandson, after all.
 Huh?
 I am Konohamaru of the Hidden Leaf Village, after all!
 H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!
 What’s going on with him? Hey Konohamaru!
 Lady Tsunade?
 Nothing…
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Back then, Sensei taught me
 that I would grow up to become a great Ninja
 through lots of effort and competition with my rivals.
 His words put me at ease.
 A path opened up for me just when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized that all I had to do was try my best.
 But now…

 – Good-bye, Sensei. – Yay! School's out!
 Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!
 Good-bye!
 Make sure you practice what I taught you today, Transform Jutsu!
 And tell your family about tomorrow’s inauguration for the Fifth Hokage!
 – Okay! 					– Okay.
 Konohamaru!
 What is it, Iruka Sensei?
 Well…it’s all right.
 See you tomorrow!
 Okay… Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!
 It looks like he got over it.
 Hey, Lee!
 On your way back from rehabilitation?
 Um…yes…
 I hope you get better soon.
 Thank you very much.
 To activate each and every cell all at once…
 If it were just one by one, it’d be a snap,
 but all of them together is gonna be tough.
 Still…
 The Leaf Village is in great trouble right now,
 so we must do our best!
 I think if you had Lady Tsunade take a look, you'd get better very quickly.
 It's better that you give up being a Shinobi and look for a different path.
 Sensei and Student: The Bond of the Shinobi
 Clone Jutsu!
 Transformation Jutsu!
 Hey, young kid…
 The medal of youth is one of passion, with no looking back!
 If you work hard at it,
 I’m telling you, son, you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!
 Who is he? He is pretty overbearing.
 Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth…
 Well then, adieu.
 That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.
 And then…
 Today, you have all become Genin.
 I want to hear what your goals are for the future.
 I don’t want to answer.
 I-I…!
 I'd like to prove that I could become a splendid Ninja,
 even though I can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 Those are good serious eyes…
 You! What's so funny?!
 I'm serious!
 I will become a respectable Ninja even only with Taijutsu!
 Don’t you realize that if you can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
 you’re not a Ninja in the first place?
 Don’t you remember being told that you’re the first person
 to graduate from the academy who’s only able to use Taijutsu ?
 It’s not because you’re so good; it’s just that you’re unusual.
 W-Why--!
 Listen up! If you have passion, it’s not necessarily so.
 If you act with passion,
 compete with good rivals and lift each other up,
 you can all become great Ninja!
 But you know, you have to work hard!
 Passion…
 I…was inspired by Guy Sensei.
 By his words…and his deeds.
 You’re late! 17 minutes and 32 seconds late!
 Let’s not do it today, all right?
 Each of us has 48 wins!
 With a win today, one of us will pull ahead!
 I guess you won't give up even if I say I wouldn’t want to do it.
 It’s my turn to choose the event, right?
 Right! What’s it gonna be?
 A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?
 Holding our breath under water?
 I don’t care, we could even have an eating contest…
 Please…
 Okay, then…
 Wh-What?!
 Rock, paper, scissors!
 Rock, paper, scissors? That’s what you choose?
 They say that your luck is one part of your skill, don’t they?
 Plus, it’s a great competition for testing your observational reflexes…
 R-Right.
 Do you get the feeling Kakashi’s just playing around with Guy
 ‘cuz he can't be bothered?
 That’s what it looks like to me.
 I accept the battle. There’s no way I’m gonna lose!
 If I do, I’ll walk around the Leaf Village 500 times on my hands!
 There you go again…
 I promise!
 Here we go…
 Another one of your special, self-imposed rules.
 He can’t do that.
 That’s ridiculous. He’s acting like a kid.
 Yeah, that’s impossible, even for Guy Sensei.
 Impossible? Reckless, I’d say!
 – Rock, paper…! – Rock, paper…!
 Here you are.
 Guy Sensei?
 How did you know I was here?
 I know everything about you.
 I heard that you skipped out on rehabilitation these past two days?
 You can’t be doing that!
 When I first became Genin…
 this is where I revealed my dream, my aspiration.
 Neji laughed at me then, but I meant what I said.
 I'd like to prove that I could become a splendid Ninja
 even though I can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
 That would be the ultimate for me!
 At that time, you told me…
 If you act with passion, compete with rivals,
 you can become a fine Ninja.
 And that…
 In order to do that, it’d take “effort.”
 I was happy to hear that.
 – Transform! 					– Transform!
 Because while at the academy…
 no one, not one friend or teacher, said that kind of thing to me.
 You put me at ease…
 You opened up a path just when I was unsure of myself.
 I realized all I had to do was try my best.
 And when I complained that
 all my efforts couldn’t match the others’ natural talents,
 you told me that I had a natural talent for effort.
 That was when I learned the importance of believing in my own strength.
 The chance of a successful surgery is probably 50%, at best.
 But…this is one time… even if I try my best…!
 and even if I believe in myself, there’s nothing in the world I can do!
 Guy Sensei… Please tell me…!
 Please tell me. Can I become like you?
 Why did this kind of thing happen only to me?
 Because I have my own Way of Ninja to follow,
 my own dreams and aspirations that I have to protect and
 prove to the world even if it means dying for…
 What should I do?!
 The Eight Inner Gates…
 Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that will destroy the body of the practitioner?
 Please tell me!
 I’m prepared for the worst.
 Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!
 Everything is…for my dream!
 That means everything to me!
 You tried to become a great Ninja relying only on Taijutsu…
 Until now, that’s all you had.
 It must be so painful for you…
 Now that it seems that your dreams
 and all your wishes are being cruelly taken away.
 It does not matter what his wishes are, he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.
 Lee…
 If you want to be free of that pain, you have to prepare yourself!
 Does it mean… to prepare to give up my dreams?
 If you lose your dreams,
 you will undergo pain even greater than what you feel now.
 Neither you nor I would be able to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we are…
 Lee! Have the surgery!
 How’s it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?
 It’s all about the Chakra, but…
 There are so many kinds of cells…
 skin cells, internal organ cells, muscular cells…
 You know, it’s just a tad difficult to activate all of them at once.
 What’s that? “Just a tad,” you say?
 Are you testing me?
 Oh no!
 I’m declaring my trust in you.
 I don’t know why, but just a while ago…
 I was remembering the time when you and Kakashi Sensei
 were competing with rock, paper, scissors.
 At that time, Kakashi Sensei said
 that your luck is one part of your skill, right?
 This surgery is also fifty-fifty, live or die…
 But…
 it’s not a game of rock, paper, scissors!
 Do you remember what happened after that, Lee?
 500 times around… lt’s a promise! Yay!
 What's he doing?!
 Shoot!
 If I lose, I’ll walk 500 times around the Leaf Village, on my hands!
 It's a promise!
 He can’t do that! That’s stupid. He’s acting like a kid.
 Hah! This is nothing!
 Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?
 Why are you doing this?
 Kakashi Sensei is not here. ln fact, no one is watching.
 When a man stands cool with a Nice-guy pose in front of others,
 he should keep his promise, even if it kills him!
 It’s a promise!
 What?
 Why do you always do that?
 Whenever you’re about to start doing something,
 why do you always come up with some kind of crazy rule.
 Good question, Lee.
 You really know how to get to the point.
 OK, I’ll tell you. But remember, you can’t tell anyone else.
 What’s the answer?
 Making self-rules is nothing less than a practice which brings me victory!
 S-Self-rules…?
 Are you ready?
 The point of these rules is that, when you’re going after something,
 they push you into a real tough spot…
 It’s about chaining yourself down.
 For example, on the other side of the hellish rule that
 “If I lose at rock, scissors, paper, I’ll do 500 laps” is the idea that
 “If I do 500 laps,
 there’s no way I won’t be able to beat Kakashi next time.”
 They hold power, the potential of the heavens.
 Y-Yes…
 By being chained down to doing 500 laps,
 it makes you get serious.
 Even about things like rock, paper, scissors competitions,
 which are so trifling otherwise.
 And, even if you lose, walking around the village 500 times
 give you the benefit of extremely intense training.
 I see!
 OK, I’ve gotta do a little more. Here we go!
 I’m going with you! I have my own “self-rule” which is--
 Hey! Hey! Don’t push yourself, Lee.
 If I can’t keep up with you, I'll…
 try even harder!
 That is, I’ll aim to be like you.
 And if I keep trying, I’ll be able to become a great Ninja!
 All right! If that’s the case, then I have an addition to my rule!
 If you can’t keep up with me all the way to the end…
 I’ll put every ounce of my being into training you!
 If I train you with all my being, you’ll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!
 I promise!
 Huh, that’s right.
 That was the first time you told me about the ""self-rule,"" wasn’t it?
 Your surgery will be a success
 because you have worked hard all the way through.
 You have the power to bring your own future in the heavens.
 And in the one in a thousand…
 no, one in a million chance that something goes wrong…
 I will die with you!
 Ever since I met you,
 my Way of Ninja has been to nurture you into a fine Ninja.
 I promise you!
 Neither you nor I would be able to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
 What fools we are…
 G-Guy Sensei!
 OK, let’s go, Lee!
 Yes, sir!
 Lady Tsunade!
 From this day forward,
 I am the ruler of the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Darn! He has no hole in his defense.
 Being impatient won't do any good, Naruto.
 Let's utilize the next mission.
 That's right. The next mission requires an overnight stay.
 – Our chance will be at the inn. – Roger that!
 Once we get to the inn, we'll wait until he's defenseless…
 – and then… 					– and then…
 – unmask him at once! – unmask him at once!
 Next time: ""Gotta See! Gotta Know! Kakashi Sensei's True Face!""

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 You have to think when using Jutsu.
 They can be used against you.
 Also, don't get caught in an obvious trap, you fool.
 A Ninja must see through deception…got it?
 I know that!
 You know, you say that because you don't get it. Listen up.
 Your movements are wasteful.
 Now!
 He finally dropped his guard!
 You're so...
 No way!
 You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.
 Damn! Another substitution…?
 He must have found out my location with those Shuriken!
 He purposely lowered his guard! Serves me right…
 I fell for the trap.
 So he's over there, eh…
 Sasuke…Where are you…?!
 Don't tell me, Kakashi Sensei already…
 No!
 That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!
 Safe! He didn't notice me.
 Sakura, behind you.
 Huh?!
 What's up with that ""A Ninja must see through deception"" stuff?!
 Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!
 I fell for it again!
 You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision
 What was that?! Huh?!
 Hold on! Where's Sensei?!
 Huh?! What's going on?!
 Huh?! What's what?!
 Sakura…
 Sasuke?!
 Sa…Saku…ra…
 P-Please…help…me…
 Maybe I went a bit overboard…
 But it's really something she should notice…
 Was that voice…Sakura's…?
 Shinobi Battle Skill ♪2, Genjutsu.
 Sakura was easily lured.
 Genjutsu, huh...?
 An illusory mind-controlling technique. I'm not surprised she got lured.
 However…
 I'm different from them.
 Why don't you say that after you get a bell…Sasuke?
 It's no use just using straightforward attacks.
 A trap?!
 What?!
 This guy's...?!
 What a guy.
 There's no time to read ""Make-Out Paradise.""
 What…? 					I…?!
 That's right! I saw Sasuke on the verge of dying and I…
 Sasuke! Don't die and leave me here!!
 Where are you?!
 So that's what it looks like behind the logs.
 Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!
 A Ninja must see through deception... eh?
 Well! I'll acknowledge that you're different from those two.
 Horse!
 Tiger!
 Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!
 What?! That's not a Jutsu that a Genin can do…
 He shouldn't have enough Chakra yet!
 He's gone! ls he behind me?! No, above me?!
 Where is he?!
 I'm under you!!
 Wha--?!
 Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.
 Shinobi Battle Skill ♪3, Ninjutsu.
 How's that? You can't move, heh?
 Although, you're…already starting to make your mark.
 But, oh well.
 They do say that the nail that sticks up gets hammered down, so…
 Damn it!
 I don't have to naively take those bells. I'll just eat in secret right now!
 Let's eat!!
 Hey.
 I was just joking…
 Too late!
 Darn it…! Is there this much of a difference in strength…?
 Sakura...
 This time it's a freshly severed head?!
 What's up with her?
 Sasuke?
 You're okay!
 Hey, cut it out! Don't cling to me!
 There's not much time left until noon. I'm going.
 Sasuke, you're still going after the bells?!
 I was able to touch them last time. Next time I'll be able to take them.
 What?! 					I-I see.
 Sure enough, you're awesome, Sasuke.
 There's no way I can take the bells from Sensei.
 At this rate, I'll face separation from Sasuke…
 Uh…say. There's really no time left…
 So let's just take it easy and try again next time.
 I'm the only one who can kill that man.
 Huh…? What? You mean Sensei?
 At that time…I was crying.
 Crying…?
 My…
 What…? What is it…?
 I'm an avenger. I must become stronger than that man…
 I don't have time for setbacks here...
 ...to kill a certain man!
 Damn it…I wasted my time talking.
 Sasuke...
 Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling…
 By the way, about this exercise…
 Well! There's no need for you guys to go back to the Academy.
 What? I… All I did was lay unconscious.
 Is that okay?
 Love is victorious!! Cha!!
 Yahooooo!
 Then, then! That means the three of us…
 Yes. The three of you…
 must quit being Ninja!!
 N-No way!
 Kakashi hasn't passed a single person this whole time…
 Iruka…
 Even I don't know if it's good for those kids to become Shinobi right away…
 However… Kakashi's judgments were correct…
 Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!
 Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to take the bells.
 But why do we have to be told to ""quit""?!
 That's because you're all squirts who don't have the qualifications to become Ninja.
 Oh!
 Sasuke!
 I'm saying you're squirts.
 Don't step on Sasuke!!
 Are you kids thinking that being a Ninja is easy? Huh?
 Why do you think you're doing this exercise in teams?
 Huh?! What do you mean?
 Put simply…
 it's as if you guys have no understanding of the answer to this test.
 Answer…?
 Yes. The answer that determines passing or failing of this test.
 That's…what I've wanted to ask about for a while now.
 Man, are you guys brainless or what?
 Don't you get the meaning of the three-man squad?!
 Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!
 That's…teamwork!
 You mean, working together?
 Exactly. But it's too late even if you realize that now.
 You might've been able to…
 take the bells if the three of you had come at me…
 Well, it's too bad.
 Now wait a minute.
 Why use teamwork if there were only two bells?
 If the three of us were to desperately go take the bells with one having to hold back,
 that wouldn't be teamwork. That'd create internal discord.
 Of course!
 This is a test set up to purposely place you against each other.
 It's under just such conditions where one's own interests aren't the issue.
 The intention was to select those who could prioritize teamwork…
 Despite this, you fools…
 Sakura!
 You were only concerned with Sasuke and you didn't even know where he was.
 And you didn't care for Naruto who was right in front of your eyes…
 Naruto!
 All you do is run solo…
 You labeled the other two as hindrances and acted on your own…
 Missions are carried out in squads!
 There's no mistaking that Ninjas need unsurpassed individual skills…
 But ""teamwork"" is considered more important than that.
 Individual actions that disrupt teamwork throw the team into crisis and lead to death…
 For example...
 ""Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies…""
 What?! What?! Whaaat?!
 Is what will…happen.
 Oh, I was so surpised.
 On top of having a hostage taken,
 you're faced with two impossible choices and end up being killed.
 Every mission is a life-risking assignment.
 Look at this…
 The many names engraved on this stone…
 These are all Ninjas who are called heroes in the village.
 That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!
 I've decided now to get my name engraved there, too!
 A hero! A hero! I'm not going to die like a dog!
 But…they're not just ordinary heroes.
 No kidding. Then, what kind of heroes are they?
 Hey! Hey!
 They are heroes who were killed in action.
 Killed in action?
 It means they died performing a mission.
 This is a memorial.
 The names of my friends are also engraved here...
 I'll give you guys one more chance!
 However, after noon it'll be a harsher battle to take the bell.
 Those who want to take on the challenge can eat lunch.
 However, don't let Naruto have any.
 It's punishment for breaking the rules and attempting to eat lunch on your own.
 If someone lets him eat…
 that person will be disqualified on the spot.
 I make the rules, here. Got it?!
 I must be going.
 Listen to me, Iruka.
 What?
 No matter what the result, don't hold it against Kakashi…
 Alright.
 I'm okay with not eating lunch! No sweat at all!
 No sweat…
 Here.
 H-Hey, Sasuke. Sensei just said…!
 It's okay. There's no sign of him now.
 The three of us are going to go take the bells together.
 It'll be trouble for me if he becomes a hindrance, so...
 Sasuke…
 Sakura…
 Thanks…
 Don't thank me. Just hurry up and eat.
 But…
 I'm on…a diet… I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.
 So you don't need to worry.
 But…
 See…
 Wha--?!
 Hurry it up. We don't know when he'll be back…
 It's just this one time.
 Okay? You got it?!
 I got it.
 You three!
 Yiiikes!
 You defied the rules so that means you know what's coming…
 Do you have…something to say?
 But you see…
 What?!
 But! But! But! You said, Sensei!
 These guys…
 We're a three-man squad, right?
 That's right! The three of us are one, so…!
 That's right! That's right! That's right!
 That's right!
 The three of you are one, eh…
 You pass!
 What?!
 Whaaat?!
 You pass!
 We passed?! Why?!
 You guys are the first.
 Up until now, it was always just dunces who would meekly listen to what I said.
 A Ninja must see through deception…
 In the world of Ninja,
 those who break rules and codes are branded as garbage…
 But…
 Those who don't cherish their friends are garbage worse than that.
 He's… He's…kinda…cool…
 That's it for the exercise…
 Everyone passes!
 Group Seven starts their mission tomorrow!
 Yes, Sir!
 I did it!! I'm a Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
 Let's go home.
 Cha!
 I...
 knew this is how it'd turn out!
 Untie the rope!
 Oh, please! It'd been nothing but blah missions until now.
 And just when I thought I'd finally gotten an awesome mission,
 to think it'd be bodyguarding this old man.
 He mocks the heck out of me, calling me a brat.
 I'll tell him a thing or two.
 Someday I'll be… Hey, are you listening?!

 Tomorrow, huh…
 The Final Rounds: Rush to the Battle Arena!
 What’s up? It’s been a while.
 Heh-heh… I was kind of in the hospital.
 The hospital?
 I’m totally fine, now.
 Nothing to it!
 I see.
 Ayame!
 Yes!
 Here you go.
 Pops?
 Just eat it.
 The final round is tomorrow, right?
 Okay, then.
 Thanks!
 You’ve got a daughter at home, so it’s not so bad, right?
 Most of my money vanishes with the food expenses.
 Moron. Your home is special, right?
 Huh?
 Girls are a drag.
 Yeah. There are times when I really don’t get how to act with her.
 Father’s have it rough…
 Hah, am I the only bad guy?
 Hey, master.
 Let me have everything on these two pages, too!
 Welcome!
 Oh! Strong reinforcements!
 Come on. You order something, too!
 Hey…Dad.
 Hmm?
 Hey! Let’s go home, already!
 Excuse me?
 Shut up. You’re supposed to live it up at a festival!
 Festival, my butt…
 What a drag.
 You idiot… Since olden times…
 the final round’s been like a festival!
 I’m in that final round tomorrow.
 Jeez, don’t make come to get you.
 You’re…in it?
 Please, Dad…
 Tomorrow, eh…
 Yeah.
 Tomorrow…is a full moon…
 To think you didn’t even get a scratch…
 Perfect, eh, Neji?
 That’s enough warm-up exercise…
 Shall we get going?
 I was nervous and couldn’t sleep.
 First…it’s him… in the first match.
 Quite honestly…even my Sharingan can’t see through his Tenketsu!
 The strongest man in the Leaf is on my team.
 It is that…Neji Hyuga!
 Neji…Neji…Neji…
 At last…
 The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!
 Yeah. He’s the number one rookie from last year, right?!
 We can’t miss the first match!
 Neji…Hyuga…
 Now I can summon a frog… lt’ll be okay.
 They all…look nasty.
 Hinata!
 Yipes! N-N-Naruto.
 W-What are you doing here?
 Today is the final round, isn’t it?
 I… Just something…
 I came to check out this training field.
 This is the place where I became Genin, so…
 Really? W-Why?
 N-Nothing…That doesn’t matter!
 Y-You’re right. I’m sorry.
 Say, Hinata…
 Neji’s a relative of yours, right?
 Y-Yes.
 Is he really strong …?
 Yes…
 I see.
 B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.
 Yeah. I’m strong, after all!
 I bet you can win, Naruto.
 What?
 You know…
 I…when you cheered for me,
 I felt like I was able to become stronger than before.
 Hinata! Hang tough!
 When the preliminaries ended,
 I became able to like myself just a little.
 I'll…
 stand…
 by my own…
 words.
 That is my way of Ninja.
 From someone else's standpoint, it might not look like anything’s changed…
 but I feel like I was able to change.
 I’ve been thinking that it was… thanks to you, Naruto.
 Say, Hinata…
 Did you really think so?
 What?
 I may look strong to you,
 but all I do is mess up…
 And I act tough because I’m frustrated.
 It’s not like that!
 Even when you messed up,
 in my view…you were always a proud failure.
 W-When I look at you, it impacts my heart.
 You’re not perfect, so…
 So…
 It’s because you mess up…
 that you have the strength to rise up from that.
 I think such strength is true strength.
 I…I think you’re an incredibly strong person.
 Thanks, Hinata!
 Even though I was always the bottom one…
 I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!
 I was depressed, which was totally not my character.
 But I feel better now!
 Naruto…
 Okay! I’m off to the match!
 Hinata…
 Huh?
 I kind of…thought you were…
 W-What…?
 …gloomy, hesitant and weird.
 Naruto…
 But I quite like…people…
 like you!
 …like you!
 Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me kick that Neji’s butt!
 Uh-oh. Time to run!
 I-I’m late, late!
 See you later, Hinata!
 Sorry I’m late, Hinata.
 Well, Shino’s match isn’t until quite a bit later, so…
 Hm? Hey? Hinata?
 Hmm? W-What?
 Oh, it’s starting!
 Move, move!
 C'mon, move!
 Dang it! There’s quite a distance!
 I won’t make it!
 Brother Naruto!
 Konohamaru?!
 I’ve come to aid in brother’s crisis, here!
 Konohamaru… What’re you doing here?!
 I’ll tell you later!
 This way, here!
 There’s an ace shortcut where you can get straight to the arena, here!
 What?!
 All right! Well done, Konohamaru!
 Those who control the secret path control time.
 Oh, I see! You’re awesome, Konohamaru!
 As I recall, there’s a hole in the wall around here…
 Oh!
 Here it is!
 Oh!
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
 The secret path has been repaired, here!
 Whaat…?
 Oh! There’s no time!
 Brother!
 Next approach!
 Look! I’m really out of time.
 It’s a secret, but there’s an awesome path
 that can get you inside the arena in an instant, here!
 What?! All right! Well done, Konohamaru!
 This hole is a shortcut?
 It’s a straight shot to the final round arena!
 No doubt, here!
 Straight shot, huh? 					Okay!
 Let’s hurry!
 Yeah!
 Konohamaru! What’s happening here?!
 It’s okay, here!
 We’re almost to the final round arena, here!
 See? There’s the exit, here!
 Oh, oh.
 What?!
 Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
 T-This is…some kind of mistake!
 Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!
 What the heck are you doing?!
 We’ve gotten further and further away!
 Until just recently,
 it was connected to the final round arena, here.
 Next approach, right away…
 This is it!
 If you ride this, you’ll get to the final round arena just like that, here!
 Huh? A bull?
 Think again, brother.
 A feudal lord Bull is not at all in the same league as ordinary cows, here.
 Once they start running, even race horses grow deathly pale.
 There’s no way they can beat a no-nonsense feudal lord cow!
 Anyway, it’s an awesome cow!
 Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,
 it’s just a short run to the final round arena, here!
 Then, I’m counting on you.
 Okay, let’s go!
 Huh? Wha--?!
 Ouch!
 What?
 Brother, go for it, here!
 Hey! Stop! Stop!
 Hey-hey, we’re missing quite a few people.
 What’s going on? lt’s going to start.
 What’s the meaning of this? Sasuke…?
 And even Naruto…
 Why is it?!
 This is bad!
 That's it!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 What’s wrong with you guys? Why are you back, hey?!
 More appeared!
 The escape path was blocked!
 It won’t do any good to multiply!
 Hmm? What the--?!

 We leave the rest to you!
 Whoa, let us in, quick!
 Hey!
 Entry has already…!
 What kind…of entrance is this kid making…?
 Naruto.
 He’s totally late.
 What a drag.
 Guys, run! A large herd of stampeding bulls is coming.
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 Jeez! I’m serious. So many of them…!
 Huh? Hey… 					Where's Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy I’m supposed to fight isn’t here, either.
 Hey, you guys there.
 Don’t be restless.
 Throw out your chests and show your faces to the spectators!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 We now start the second test of the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! Let’s go!
 Okay! First we search for that thing. Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Slow down, Lee! We just started.
 I know. But…
 I can’t stay still!
 Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us?!
 As you already understand, we have only one target!
 It sounds like they’ve already started.
 Huh? That was someone’s scream just now, right?
 I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!
 I-I have to pee.
 Y-You… Fool!
 What are you doing in front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest
 Oh…! Ohhh...!
 Aaah… that was a lot!
 Feels much better!
 C’mon Naruto! I told you not to say things like that in front of a lady--!
 What?!
 S-Sasuke…
 no matter what, you don’t have to go that far.
 W-What was that for?
 Where’s the real Naruto?!
 Huh?
 I don't know what the heck you’re talking about!
 What happened to the scratch you got earlier from the Proctor?!
 And…your Shuriken holster is on your left leg.
 That guy’s right-handed.
 You’re worse at transformation than Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky me! In that case...
 Which one of you got  the scroll?!
 Since things have come to this, I’ll resort to force!
 Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Heeeey! Sasuke!
 You’ve got to be kidding, loser.
 All right!
 I caught you off guard! Lucky!
 Paper Bomb…!
 This is lucky!
 I’ll kill you if you move! Calmly hand over the scroll!
 Sasuke!
 I won’t let you get away!
 Y-You’re always late Naruto!
 Absorption with my Chakra.
 Sasuke…
 Don’t just stand there, Sakura!
 No guarantee this guy's alone!
 Got it?!
 If you let your guard down you’ll really get killed…
 It’s unlucky! I came on my own to conceal my presence,
 but that became my enemy…
 He got away, huh…?
 If there’s an instance that we become separated,
 don’t trust him if he looks like your teammate.
 Just like now there’s a possibility
 that an enemy will transform to get close to us!
 – Yeah. 					– So what do we do?
 We’ll decide on a password.
 Password?
 Listen, if the password is incorrect, no matter what he looks like…
 presume he is an enemy!
 I’ll only say it once, so listen closely.
 You ask,  Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”
 And the answer is this:
 “The chance to sneak up when a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 “The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 “It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 “The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.”
 That’s it.
 Okay!
 Could you say it again?
 Huh?!
 I told you I’d only say it once.
 Could it be that you couldn’t memorize it?
 – You fool! 					– Huh?!
 I got it right away!
 I-I memorized it perfectly!
 I thought just in case, I’d listen one more time…
 I’ll carry the scroll!
 Hey, wait Sasuke.
 Ouch!
 What is it?
 A new enemy?!
 You guys go play around …
 I’ll go alone…
 Sakura!
 Sasuke!
 Don’t come closer!
 First the password…
 Ninja song, “Ninja Chance”!
 Ah! Umm…
 The chance to sneak up where a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.
 Good.
 Owwww!
 Hey everyone, are you okay?
 Naruto, wait!
 The password…
 I know…
 The chance to sneak up where a large number of enemies are making a scene.
 The quiet place has no secret hideout.
 It is important for a Shinobi to know the right time.
 The time when an enemy is tired and drops his guard.
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 What are you doing?!
 This time it’s someone who can dodge my attack, huh?
 What are you saying, Sasuke?
 Naruto just said the password properly.
 He was able to say it,  that’s the problem!
 – Huh?! 					– Wha--?
 Do you really think that guy can remember a password that long?
 Oh!
 If we asked the normal Naruto what the password is,
 what do you think he’d say?
 “Sorry. I’ve forgotten it.”
 Besides, his movements when he avoided my attack…
 It was clearly different from Naruto’s!
 Show your true self already, fake one!
 That’s how it is, huh…
 But if you knew he would forget it,
 why didn’t you make the password shorter?
 I knew that you were underground
 eavesdropping on our conversation.
 So I chose that password on purpose.
 Oh really. So you’re not tired or letting your guard down.
 This will be more fun than I thought.
 This person’s…too creepy!
 And where’s Naruto?
 Huh?
 Owww!
 And heave!
 Huh? Where are Sakura and that Sasuke?
 H-Huge!
 This is the first time I’ve seen… a snake this huge!
 Behind?!
 T-Tail!
 You want our Earth Scroll, don’t you?
 ‘Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.
 Well, let’s begin…
 the battle for the Scrolls.
 Life or Death!
 Genjutsu?!
 No, that's not it.
 This is simply a thirst for blood.
 What’s going on?
 Just looking at her eyes made me think of death.
 Who is this…woman?!
 Sa…kura…?
 It’s no good.
 We have no choice but to flee here.
 Unless we do, the only thing waiting for us is…
 Death!
 Let me out! Hey!
 Spit... me... out!
 Darn! lt’s not going to work.
 Something else...
 Oh!
 The rice ball I took for lunch!
 Huh?!
 It’s dissolving!
 I’ll be digested just like that rice ball eventually…
 N-No!
 Let me out! Let me... out!
 Can’t move already...?
 She’s going to kill me!
 Move…move…move…!
 Move!
 Move! Move!
 Move!
 Even if it’s just a little… Move!
 What do you intend to do... with that?
 I can’t move!
 Don’t worry. I’ll end this in a second.
 You won’t even have the time to feel pain.
 I wanted you to entertain me more.
 It’s too bad.
 Am… I going to die here?

 Old Man Hokage…
 Konohamaru...
 Kakashi Sensei.
 Sakura.
 Sasuke.
 A lot happened between him and me.
 Even though we always squabbled,
 we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei in that encounter with Zabuza.
 During our Chakra training in forest,
 we competed each other and practiced climbing up trees.
 That’s it! I haven’t…
 settled things with him yet!
 – More rice! 					– More rice!
 If this creature doesn’t want to spit me out …
 I’ll make it to do so at any cost!
 I see.
 Sasuke!
 He wounded himself at the last moment…
 Move. Move. Move. 					Move...!
 Move!
 He wiped out the fear with pain.
 As expected, he’s not the average prey.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I...am a Shinobi who will become Hokage!
 I won’t put up with being snake dung in this place!
 Sasuke.
 Are you okay?
 If we don’t flee in a hurry, we’ll be discovered here, too.
 How do we flee…?
 How should we escape…?
 I’ve never seen Sasuke…
 so worked up.
 Sasuke, a snake!
 Shoot! I was too shaken up to notice the snake!
 Don’t come near me!
 Don’t lower your guard, not even for a moment…
 A prey must always stay tense and try to flee desperately...
 before a predator.
 Ahh... Huh?!
 Sorry Sasuke..
 Naruto!
 The password… I forgot it!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you

 When I was searching for Old Lady Tsunade…
 Die!
 Shoot!
 Pervy Sage and the old lady…
 Despite the fact that he was fighting two of them at once,
 he was incredibly powerful.
 He’s one dangerous dude.
 That strong…
 It’ll all be fine, believe it!
 Sasuke wouldn’t fall to that kind of guy’s enticement.
 He’s already a really powerful guy,
 so he wouldn’t need to do that kind of thing!
 I guarantee it!
 Yeah!
 Why does Master Orochimaru want this guy anyway?
 Kimimaro would have been much better…
 Well, if you stay in a seedy place like this,
 you’ll just remain mediocre at best.
 You’ll never become strong…
 Wh-Why…?
 All my barrages were solid. Yet this guy…
 doesn't seem to have sustained any damage.
 If you keep on fooling around playing Ninja with your friends,
 you’re just gonna continue to rot.
 Come with us.
 If you do, Master Orochimaru will empower you.
 There’s no meaning if we take you by force, he said.
 You decide.
 Gimme a break…
 Master Orochimaru sure sent me on a bothersome mission.
 Hey! What did you decide?
 Are you coming?
 Or are you not coming?!
 Decide already!
 When a weakling like you lags,
 it makes me wanna just finish you!
 Try me…!
 You…those Curse Marks…
 Don’t be so sure that
 you’re the only favorite of Master Orochimaru.
 One shouldn’t use Curse Marks that lightly.
 Or rather…it looks like you’re not even able to control the Curse Marks.
 If they continue to be released for a long period of time,
 Curse Marks will progressively eat your body.
 It looks like you’re still at first state,
 so the speed at which they will eat away at you is still fairly slow.
 But when they have entirely eaten you,
 you will lose yourself.
 Forever.
 In exchange for having been empowered by Curse Marks,
 you will be tethered by Master Orochimaru.
 We no longer have anything like freedom.
 In order to receive something, one must discard something.
 What is your objective?
 Are you and your comrades just going to comfort each other
 in this lukewarm village…
 then simply forget all about…
 Itachi Uchiha?
 Don’t forget your objective.
 This kind of village does nothing more than shackle you!
 Cut your stupid ties with this place.
 If you do that, you’ll…
 be able to obtain much, more fabulous power.
 Don’t forget your objective!
 Thanks!
 H-Hey Sakura.
 I’ll walk you home!
 Huh? Don’t worry about it.
 Why, why? The streets are dangerous at night!
 They’re well lit, so I’ll be fine…
 Sakura?
 Thanks, Naruto.
 But I want to go home alone tonight.
 I see…
 I’ll be fine!
 Yeah!
 Why are you hanging around in a place like this in the middle of the night?
 One has to pass down this road to leave the village.
 Go home and sleep.
 Why…
 Why won’t you tell me anything?
 Why are you always silent like that?
 You won’t tell me one single thing.
 Why should I have to tell you anything?!
 I’m telling you to keep your nose out of my business.
 Stop bothering me over everything I do.
 I…make you dislike me all the time, don’t I?
 Do you remember?
 We just became Genin and the Three-Man Squads were assigned…
 You and I were alone for the first time, here at this very spot.
 You got mad at me.
 See! That guy doesn’t have parents, right?
 He’s all alone and he doesn’t have to deal with parents lecturing him…
 That’s why he can sometimes be selfish!
 Solitude…
 Huh?
 Isn’t the same as being scolded by one’s parents.
 What’s the matter all of a sudden….
 You…are annoying…
 I don’t remember that.
 Yeah, I guess… that was long ago, after all…
 But it all began that day.
 Sasuke and me…
 And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei…
 The four of us went on various missions, didn’t we?
 Those were tough and difficult times, but…
 But…
 more than anything…
 it was so much fun!
 I know about your family, Sasuke…
 But revenge…
 that won’t bring anyone happiness.
 No one…
 Neither you…
 nor I.
 As I expected…
 I’m different from you guys…
 I’m walking a road that’s incompatible with the rest of you.
 The four of us worked together…
 and it’s true that there was a time when I thought that was my road.
 The four of us have worked together,
 but in the end, I decided on revenge.
 That’s been my reason for living.
 I can’t become like you and Naruto.
 Are you going to isolate yourself again, Sasuke?!
 You taught me that solitude is a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!
 Now I know exactly how that feels.
 I have both family and friends…
 But if you were no longer here, Sasuke…
 for me…
 for me it would be the same as solitude.
 From here again…
 we’re going to start walking our new paths individually.
 I…!
 I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!
 If you would only be with me, Sasuke,
 I won't let you regret it, no matter what!
 I’ll make it fun every day and you will definitely find happiness!
 I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke!
 So…I’m begging you, please stay here!
 I’ll even help you with your revenge!
 I’ll make it happen somehow, I promise you…!
 So stay here…with me…!
 If that doesn’t work for you…
 Then take me with you…
 You really are…annoying.
 Don’t go!
 If you go, I’ll scream and…
 Sakura…
 Thank you…
 Sasuke…
 We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.
 What’s your intention?
 It was already decided that you would be our leader
 the moment you exited the village.
 Please forgive our rudeness up to now.
 I don’t care about any of that.
 Let’s go.
 This is the beginning!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 What? That jerk Sasuke.
 What the heck is he thinking? He has such a twisted personality!
 What is it that he disliked so much that he'd do something like this?!
 Damn! I'm not about to let that guy do whatever he wants!
 If things come to this, I'll chase him down to the end of the world.
 I'll drag that guy back even if I have to grab him by his neck!

170,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Inari! Give me a hand. 21	02:16:45:14	02:16:46:22 I'll be right there.
 This mist…
 Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!
 I knew he was still alive.
 Making an appearance so soon, eh…
 Say, Kakashi Sensei.
 This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
 I see you've got those brats with you as always.
 He's still trembling. Poor thing.
 I'm trembling with…excitement.
 Do it, Sasuke.
 I can see him!
 Well, well.
 So you discerned the Water Doppelganger Jutsu.
 That brat's grown quite a bit.
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 Damn it!
 I'm totally late!
 Well, well… It seems my prediction was right on the money.
 Prediction?
 That little mask...
 Oh!
 I knew it… Heh!
 So the Elite Shinobi of the Hidden Mist thing
 was a bald-faced lie!
 No matter how you look at him, he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.
 Standing together with him and all…
 How dare he show up like that after what he did!
 I hate brats who think they're so cool…
 He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.
 Oh…really?
 I'll do it.
 Huh?
 With his bad acting… I hate brats who think they're so cool!
 Sasuke, you are so cool!
 That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke…
 He's an impressive youth.
 Hmm...
 Even though those Water Clones
 have only 1/10th the strength of their original...
 To think he went that well.
 However, you made the preemptive move.
 Go!
 Right!
 What?!
 Haku's Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors
 Are you Tazuna's daughter?
 Sorry, but you're coming with us.
 Mom!
 Don't come out! Get out of here, quick!
 What's with you, brat?!
 Shall we take him, too?
 One hostage is fine.
 Hostage…?!
 Then...
 Shall we kill him?
 Wait!
 If you lay a hand on that child…
 I'll bite off my tongue and kill myself!
 You want a hostage, right?
 Thank your mom, kid.
 Oh, man… 					lt's not enough…
 Knock it off. You just tried out your sword earlier.
 Forget it already and let's take the woman.
 Mom, I'm sorry...
 I'm so sorry!
 I'm weak, so I can't protect you…
 I don't want to die… I'm scared!
 You crybaby…
 So you're just gonna cry all day like the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can just cry forever! You crybaby!
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaning of the word strong.
 Like your father.
 For the things I truly hold dear to myself…
 I protect them until the end with both these arms,
 even if it looks like I might lose my life!
 Inari…
 Can I…
 can I also become strong…?
 Dad!
 Looking at that beautiful skin of yours makes me want to cut you.
 Hey…walk faster.
 Wait!
 Inari!
 What? It's just the kid from before.
 Get…get away from my mom!
 Man…This brat's hopeless.
 Let's do it!
 If you do that, I'll bite off my tongue and--
 Shut up. Go to sleep.
 I…na…ri.
 Well, well… He can see that speed, eh…
 Yes…
 Sakura, surround Tazuna and don't move away from me.
 Let Sasuke handle him!
 Okay.
 I don't want to have to kill you…
 I'd like for you to back down.
 Nonsense…
 I knew it…
 But you won't be able to keep up  with my speed.
 Also, I've already made two preemptive moves.
 Two preemptive moves?
 The first one is the scattered water.
 And the second one was blocking one of your hands…
 Therefore, you'll just be able to defend my attack…
 What?! With one hand he's…?!
 A one-handed Sign?
 I've never seen such a thing before…
 A Thousand Needles of Death!
 So he doesn't want to kill him…eh.
 I wonder if that's how he really feels…
 Sasuke!
 Remember…that training…
 Build up Chakra at one burst…
 The Substitution Jutsu…?!
 The woman… Hmm?
 Sorry I was late.
 Heroes usually appear on the scene late, so…
 Naruto…!
 Inari, you did well!
 Huh?
 Thanks to you distracting them, I was able to save your mom.
 Naruto…how did you know that those samurai were here?
 In the forest, there was a boar that had been cut-up with a sword.
 Other than that, there were trees with lots of cuts.
 They headed in the direction of your house…
 so I got worried.
 I see.
 Well…
 If it isn't the no-good Ninja that Tazuna hired…
 Let's do it…
 Yeah…
 Here they come!
 Hah! Something like that won't work!
 Fools.
 Prepare yourself!
 W-Wow…!
 It's done!
 Naruto, you're just like... a Ninja!
 You fool. I was a Ninja to start with!
 Build up Chakra at one burst…
 to the feet!
 He vanished…
 You're surprisingly stupid…
 From here on… you'll only defend my attack!
 To think Haku would lose in speed…
 It seems that I'm faster than you…
 I can't have you mocking our team, calling them brats…
 He may not look it,
 but Sasuke is the number one rookie of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 And Sakura is our sharpest…
 Hah! Serves you right!
 And the other one is the number one hyperactive,
 knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.
 You have a cold?
 I'm okay.
 Anyway... Sorry about yesterday, Inari.
 Huh?
 Branding you a crybaby… Forget I ever said that.
 You're strong!
 Dang it!
 I…decided never to cry again, but…
 Now you'll laugh at me again and call me a crybaby.
 What're you saying…?!
 It's okay…when you're happy.
 It's okay to cry when you're happy!
 Naruto…
 Now then. I can leave the rest to you, right?
 Yeah…
 Okay, I'm going to hop over to the bridge for a bit.
 Man, it's tough being a hero! That's for sure!
 Haku, do you know what this means?
 At this rate, you'll be defeated by your intended victim…
 Yes…
 What…?
 It's unfortunate…
 Is this…cold air…?
 Hidden Jutsu!
 Crystal Ice Mirrors!
 What is it? What's that Jutsu?
 Are these…mirrors?!
 What…
 in the world…?!
 Damn it!
 I'm your opponent, aren't I?
 Since that Jutsu has appeared… he's done for.
 Now then…I'll start.
 I shall show you... my true speed!
 Sasuke!
 Sasuke!
 If you make a move, I'll kill those two!!
 I'm sorry, Tazuna!
 I'm stepping away from here for a bit.
 Sure. Go!
 Sakura!
 Sasuke!
 Take this!
 He caught it?!
 What?!
 Who is it?!
 It's that idiot…that showoff…
 The number one hyperactive, knucklehead Ninja…
 Naruto Uzumaki…
 is finally here!
 Naruto Uzumaki is finally here!
 It'll be okay.
 Now that the hero of the story has appeared,
 I'll smash those stupid funny-looking mirrors in no time…
 Huh? Why won't mirrors made of ice break?
 Why won't they melt?
 What the heck is going on here?!

 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,

 Please don’t die… I’ll get you out now.
 Hey!
 What are you doing there?
 Curry of Life Shop
 One, two… 					One, two…
 Hope they’re all right.
 I’m sure they’ll be able to bring Karashi back.
 Definitely, Definitely.
 One, two…
 That’s the Katabami Gold Mine…
 Instead of just getting Rokusuke and Karashi back,
 let’s finish the Kurosuki Family once and for all!
 Don’t get carried away, Naruto.
 So, what are we gonna do then?
 I’m kind of worried about what Guy Sensei told us.
 The boss of the Kurosuki Family may be
 one of the Seven Ninja Swords Men of the Mist.
 Who knows what they’ll do to Rokusuke?
 Yeah, but how seriously can we take Guy Sensei’s info?
 What are you talking about?! Guy Sensei is always right!
 Calm down, Lee. We should investigate first.
 Yeah!
 Sir Raiga, we were able to capture Rokusuke,
 one of the three that slipped out of the village.
 Well done.
 It seems that they went to ask for some help from a Ninja village.
 Where did you go?!
 I’m sorry.
 Don’t bother, rookie.
 Yes sir!
 Rokusuke, I thought we had a good relationship
 with everybody in the Gold Mine.
 Well, that’s…
 Why is it? I’m so deeply sorry to hear that you left the village.
 I can’t remember how things were in the past,
 when everything was going well.
 I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again!
 Yeah, I have a good idea.
 I’m going to arrange for your funeral.
 Please don’t! Please let me go!
 I won’t do it again, so please forgive me!
 Why? Don’t you like funerals?
 No, I don’t wanna die yet!
 You know, I really like funerals…
 Think about it.
 When they are alive, humans speak ill of each other,
 they betray each other, and they hate each other.
 But at a funeral,
 they forget all the hatred they had for the other.
 They even remember the good times they had together.
 Right?
 You have to be kidding me! No! Please don’t do it.
 Hey!
 Let me go!
 It’s a done deal then. Let’s have a big funeral for Rokusuke.
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Come on!
 Hurry up!
 Is that gold? There’s nothing shiny about it.
 They have to melt that ore into mercury.
 After that they evaporate it and only then does it turn into pure gold.
 I don’t get it.
 Well, there is no need for you to understand it.
 Oh!
 Huh? What are you doing?! Hurry up!
 If you don’t hurry up,
 I’m gonna ask the boss to let me hold your funeral!
 Please forgive me!
 I’m getting really mad now. I won't forgive them!
 Calm down, Naruto…
 We don’t know anything about them yet.
 That’s right. We should do what Neji is telling us.
 Yeah but…
 if we don’t do something, that poor old guy is going to die!
 Naruto, leave things to me here.
 Wait, Lee!
 Hey, hey. Hurry up and pick them up!
 Yeah! Way to go, Lee!
 Are you okay, old man?
 Oh my gosh! What have you done?!
 Here. Drink some water.
 What are you doing?!
 I beg you. Please punch me, kick me.
 Please knock me around
 like the way you just did with those guys.
 What are you saying?
 If you won’t do it, I’ll do it myself!
 What are you doing?!
 Stop!
 I’m scared.
 Just think what they’ll do
 if they knew I was the only one that was safe.
 What was that sound?
 Did they find us?
 Oh my, that’s the sound of the funeral bell.
 Funeral?
 Yeah.
 Raiga, the boss of the Kurosuki family which rules this town,
 arranges a funeral for those who betray him.
 He buries them alive.
 What? They bury them alive? That’s so cruel!
 Yeah but…
 Raiga always cries sadly during the funeral.
 That’s one weird guy.
 But…
 That doesn’t seem to be the sound of the bell for you.
 Yeah, I heard that Rokusuke was caught this morning, so…
 What?!
 I’m so happy, I remember the first day I met that guy.
 Yeah? That’s nice.
 Yeah… When I told him we were taking over the mountain from the magistrate,
 he was so relieved to be freed from the high taxes that he was paying.
 He was laughing out of pure joy… He was a really nice guy.
 I like funerals. Makes me feel nostalgic.
 Would you put on a big funeral for me too?
 Fool! I’m not putting on a funeral for you.
 You are not going to die before me.
 I don’t have to have a funeral for you to think of the good times
 because you are always a good boy.
 Raiga.
 What is it?
 They're coming. They’ll show up anytime now.
 Yeah… I’m excited to see what kind of help he sought.
 Okay! Let’s save the guy.
 Let’s do it, Neji.
 Okay.
 Byakugan!
 It’s all right. He’s still alive.
 If we can get rid of the guys around him,
 we can save him.
 Okay! Let’s get rid of them quickly!
 Yeah!

 You are…
 Who is this guy?
 Well…
 This is Karashi.
 The one Grandma Sansho was talking about…
 This is Karashi?
 Karashi, was it your own decision to join the Kurosuki Family…
 just like Grandma Sansho said it was?
 So what if it was?
 What?!
 Sir Raiga is great!
 He dethroned the old evil government of the Katabami Gold Mine,
 and he liberated everybody from the village!
 One, two, one two…
 One, two, one two…
 Umm, Grandma…
 Oh my… 					You are so greedy!
 They are fighting their lives out there by going into the gold mine…
 Can’t you just wait at least while I’m cooking the curry?
 I don’t mind waiting but… I think something is burning.
 What?
 Oh my, oh my…
 Oops…
 Yeah, it burned…
 Karashi, did you know that
 Grandma Sansho worries about you everyday while cooking curry?
 Naruto, leave things to me here.
 Karashi, you saved my life with your curry of life.
 If you can make such a wonderful curry,
 how can you stay with the family of a man with no respect for life?!
 Why?
 Nobody cares to compliment me even if I can make that curry.
 As a man born in this world,
 I should gain more power and try to take over the world!
 Instead of sitting around in that store that no one patronizes anymore.
 What? I can’t take this anymore!
 Lee!
 Karashi, not only did you and Grandma Sansho’s curry save my life…
 But you also taught me that if you make it from the heart,
 just one serving of curry could save lives,
 and that even somebody like me could do anything just by trying hard.
 You looked much stronger and dignified then than you do now.
 Karashi!
 I’ve never seen anybody who tries this hard.
 I see. You want to save this boy too, huh…
 Please promise me… Please get out of the Kurosuki Family!
 You're right…
 I’m sorry… I’m so sorry!
 Oh, I’m so relieved.
 Hey! Please get me out of here.
 It’s dark and I can’t breathe.
 Oh yeah!
 We almost forgot about Rokusuke.
 Mmm? You guys…
 Sorry to keep you waiting. lt’s all right now.
 I’m sorry. Thinking that maybe
 I could still save my friend who got buried alive…
 I just couldn’t stay still.
 Yeah, I understand.
 Neji, what is it?
 What is this?
 This feeling of danger…
 Hey Neji, what is it?
 We are being watched. lt’s probably Raiga.
 What?
 From the top of that cliff…
 Okay. Let’s go!
 Karashi, please take care of Rokusuke.
 All right.
 No one’s here.
 Where did he go?
 Mmm? What is that?
 This mist…
 Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu!
 Hidden Mist Jutsu… A specialty of Mist Village Ninja.
 So, what Guy Sensei said was true?
 Damn, I can’t see anything!
 Neji, try to find the enemy with your Byakugan.
 I’ve been trying…!
 Uh…Can’t see a thing!
 That’s impossible. Even Neji’s Byakugan
 that’s supposed to let him see 360 degrees won’t work!
 What’s going on?
 There isn’t supposed to be a Jutsu that can break Byakugan!
 What do you think, Ranmaru?
 It’s amazing…
 One of them can see through the Chakra Network.
 He probably has some sort of Kekkei Genkai power.
 He can see us?
 It’s all right, my power is superior to his…
 So, what are you going to do?
 Everybody in the Katabami Gold Mine is depending on me.
 I’m the one who has to keep the peace of this village.
 Are you going to hold a funeral?
 No, even if I hold a funeral, I have no memories of them.
 I’ll just get rid of them!
 Look, Ninja Art: Lightning Fang!
 Wh-What is it?!
 Lighting! Drop!
 What do you think, Ranmaru?
 It’s great, Raiga!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 Naruto Barrage! What?
 Leaf Hurricane! Mm?
 Here I come! Huh?
 Impossible!
 Hey! The enemy disappeared!
 I have nobody either!
 What? There is no enemy!
 Neji! Are you using your Byakugan correctly?!
 I am doing it right!
 It’s impossible, but my Byakugan is picking up Chakra!

 and rechecking them.
 But it seems like they have collected all of them.
 What is the meaning of this?
 I have no idea…
 Lady Tsunade! We have a report
 from those who headed to the Hidden Waterfall Village!
 Was there movement?!
 Actually, it turns out that it was only a large-scale practice run!
 They are saying that they see no signs of an invasion of Leaf Village.
 What?!
 It seems as though they have already finished their practice run,
 and the Hidden Waterfall Village is back to normal.
 So Genno and Hidden Waterfall Village have nothing to do with each other…?
 Disengage the S-Level Emergency Security Alert!
 Order all forces back to village!
 Yes!
 What in the world was that man plotting?!
 Lady Tsunade!
 What now?!
 The body that the Anbu Black-Ops gathered…
 It's…
 It’s not Genno…?
 What does that mean?
 But I thought that Old Man Genno was cornered by the Anbu Black Ops
 and blew himself up.
 He traded places with a corpse that he had ready right before the explosion…
 That’s a huge possibility!
 We’re in the middle of confirming that!
 Their appearances look similar, but small details bring up questions!
 Most likely…it’s another man.
 Are you telling me he fooled the Anbu Black Ops!
 That means, Genno is…
 He’s still alive!
 Damn! What is that man up to…?
 Over there. Behind that tree.
 It’s here!
 I see… The Old Man Genno used this hole to get away.
 He camouflaged it well.
 If it wasn’t for the Byakugan, we would have missed it.
 Not only that…
 This hole is made so that it closes naturally by the weight of the earth.
 If we came here another day later,
 it would have been extremely difficult to find,
 even with the Byakugan.
 And to prove that,
 you can barely see any sign of an entrance to this hole.
 Akamaru, can you follow his scent?
 He’s even got getting rid of his smell covered…
 Where could he have gone?
 Our conclusion is that…
 Old Man Genno is still alive
 and there's a possibility that he's hiding in Leaf Village.
 He got cornered, and faked his own suicide,
 and stole the plans so that he could…
 make all of us turn our eyes outside of the village.
 He could have already known about the big practice run
 in the Hidden Waterfall Village and used that to his advantage.
 B-But the Anbu Black Ops started to mark Genno because
 they happened to find out that his letter of recommendation was a fake, right?
 Was it a coincident…?
 Isn’t it strange that a real letter of recommendation was
 at the house of the carpenter boss he worked for?
 Then what is his true goal?
 If we knew the answer to that, we wouldn’t be struggling so much…
 Shikamaru!
 The only thing I can say now is…
 The number of Shinobi in this village currently is at its lowest ever.
 We only have a bare minimum of us here!
 And most of their eyes are looking outside of the village.
 Even if Genno was walking around as he was humming on the streets,
 no one would suspect anything of him.
 Did he set a trap in the village?!
 Could the fact that that he scattered the plans around mean that
 he’s already done setting his trap?
 No, this is just a diversion to turn our eyes.
 We can’t leave this place without any security,
 but we have few people…
 Then where do we look?
 The Academy.
 The Academy?
 Why the Academy out of all the important facilities in the village?
 Out of all the sites Genno worked on,
 only the Academy’s repair plan was stolen.
 It’s hard to think that it was a coincidence
 for it to disappear at this timing.
 Byakugan!
 Well?
 There’s nothing in this room.
 Then…move ahead to the next room.
 Byakugan!
 Seems like there’s nothing in this area
 Can’t you look at the entire campus at once?
 And we have Hinata too, you know?
 That would be possible if we know what the target was,
 but we’re looking for something suspicious.
 We’ll have to take the basic route.
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 You’re in the way!
 And there’s too many… people here.
 Like I said!
 All I want is for you guys to come outside even just for a moment!
 Our teacher told us to study on our own in the classroom for today!
 We can’t go out of the room!
 There are no teachers today!
 So nobody would know if you left the class!
 We used to skip class when lruka Sensei wasn’t looking
 when we were younger.
 Oh! A delinquent!
 – Delinquent! 					– Delinquent!
 We have to check this area!
 Besides, all the teachers have gone on a mission to protect the village.
 Why are you guys still here?
 They must be useless.
 What did you say?! We’re also protecting the village too…
 Naruto. You’re wasting time
 Let’s crush them!
 What?
 The Expansion Jutsu!
 We’re going to tell on you to our teacher!
 Yeah, do as you please!
 Idiot!
 Let’s practice our Kunai Knives.
 Sounds good.
 It doesn’t seem like there’s anything suspicious…
 Hurry up!
 Wait!
 Come on. I’m begging you to leave!
 Naruto!
 Where did those kids from the next classroom go?
 I don’t know…
 They were going to practice their Kunai Knives.
 That’s what they were saying.
 Oh, yeah, yeah. That’s right.
 They’re practicing their Kunai Knives in a place like that?
 I’ll do next.
 Ok. Do your best!
 Do it!
 Yeah!
 Oh, so close.
 They really are practicing…
 When we were students at the Academy,
 we used to skip class and come here.
 The teacher’s couldn’t find us here, it really was great!
 I read comic books, and took naps…
 That’s right, I ate potato chips.
 Well, that’s no good!
 You can learn something from those kids.
 Even if the teachers doesn’t see you,
 you should still commit to your practice!
 They’re true models of students!
 Wonderful! I’m excited! I’m moved!
 I’d like to take class with them!
 We wouldn’t want to interrupt. Let’s go.
 Yeah…
 Naruto…
 What?
 Did they have that before?
 I’m going to get this one!
 Ouch!
 I had it!
 It seems pretty new.
 Genno could have made it…
 I-I’m going to get Neji or Hinata!
 You guys get out of the way.
 You’re getting in the way of our practice.
 O-Oh I’m sorry!
 I’m next!
 Byakugan!
 It’s a Paper Bomb! lt’s hidden behind the wall!
 What, inside the wall?!
 It’s completely hidden inside the wall.
 But then how do you detonate it…?
 Oh, there she is.
 Hey! Hinata!
 Naruto.
 Naruto…
 Hinata, go out with me!
 Wh-What are you saying at a time like this?!
 Huh?
 I-I don't know… Go out with you?
 You won’t?
 I-I’m not necessarily saying no…
 Then I’ll just ask Neji then. See you later!
 What?
 There’s a thin thread attached to the Paper Bomb.
 A thread?
 It’s probably a special thread used to ignite it.
 He's probably is going to detonate it from a distance…
 Where is that thread connected to?!
 It goes around the classroom and…
 It goes outside… towards the training hall…?
 There’s a log standing…
 This… Could it be?!
 Neji! Come with me for a second!
 What is it! We’re in the middle of something…
 Actually there’s a strange log standing in the training hall over there.
 We wanted him to check it.
 That’s the triggering device!
 Huh?
 Try loosening up your shoulders and then throw it.
 Shut up.
 All right, I’m up next.
 There should be a target on the log.
 Yeah, there is.
 The center of the target is the triggering device!
 When a Kunai Knife hits the center…
 the device will activate…
 And the Academy will explode!
 So close!
 If you focus, you’ll hit the target.
 All right, I’m going to hit this time.
 Focus…
 And target!
 Don’t let anybody hit the target!
 All right, I hit the target!
 You did it!
 Oh?
 The tip is cracked. You always have to take care of your tools.
 Damn, I thought that I hit the target.
 This way! Behind there!
 All right… I’m going to hit it for sure!
 That’s the spirit!
 This looks good!
 This time I’m going to hit it!
 Bushy Brow!
 Stop it, Lee!
 What?
 Oh, did I scare you?
 I’m sorry. I just dropped my Ninja tool… Here.
 Bushy Brow, you did it!
 I had the target!
 Why did you get in the way?!
 Be quiet! lf that had hit the target,
 the Academy would have exploded!
 What…?
 For real?
 A triggering device in here…huh?
 When something hits the center, the Academy explodes.
 So there hasn’t been anyone who’s been able to hit the center.
 We really were lucky.
 We were lucky, huh?
 So who started to practice throwing their Kunai-Knife here?
 Who? Who was it?
 Somebody told us that we'd be praised
 if we got better at Kunai-Knife throwing in secret from the teachers.
 ""in secret from from the teachers…""
 Whoever must’ve used Genjutsu to make them think that.
 It must be Genno.
 What happened?
 W-Well… There's more than one thread coming out of the triggering device.
 Is that true Hinata?
 Yeah…
 Byakugan!
 True. There's not just one…two…no, three?
 Where are they connected to?
 Outside of the academy… 					No!
 Wait! It’s hard to see from here.
 U-Umm… M-Me too…
 Byakugan!
 Byakugan!
 I found one.
 I found one, too
 Tell us the location.
 No, wait. The thread splits again.
 Over here too…
 Th-This is…
 No…way…
 It can't be…
 Hey! What’s the matter!
 There’s Paper Bombs planted all over the village!
 It’s not just 10 or 20…
 It's countless numbers of them!
 What?!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves is a nest of Paper Bombs!
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 – Now, the Academy is safe. – All right!
 It’s too early to feel relieved.
 If he realizes the Paper Bombs are being deactivated,
 he might blow up the village by a different method.
 Then we have to evacuate everyone quickly!
 – Then he'll know what we're doing! – That means…
 Pretend we don’t notice anything and get rid of the Paper Bombs.
 Everyone, get to it at once!
 – Yeah! 					– Yes.

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Special technique!
 Shadow  Clone Jutsu, fishing version!
 Thrash about more!
 I want to catch some for curing!
 Three isn't enough!
 Three more, you loser!
 This is very taxing, you know?!
 I mean, let's switch!
 Sasuke!
 The fire's ready to light! Fireballs please.
 I guess three is okay for the time being…
 Wha--?
 Hey, wait a minute!
 The Scroll's Secret: No Peeking Allowed
 It's already been four days since the second exam started.
 Yeah.
 That's right.
 The start of the second exam was around three in the afternoon.
 We only have twenty-five or twenty-six hours left.
 There may already be some teams that have passed.
 That means…
 I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.
 We're soon going to be in a hot spot…
 That's the biggest one.
 Believe it!
 Okay…
 Even if we were to try pursuit,
 there's probably hardly anybody left to become targets.
 What do we do?
 Almost everyone's surely already passed.
 Yeah.  It's already been four days, after all.
 Anyway…
 It's early afternoon now…
 Let's have a meal.
 You two rest a bit and I'll go find us something to eat.
 Say…
 Hmm?
 As I recall, on the other one…
 ""Heaven"" was written here…
 and unlike this, both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?
 Umm, when I was shown the scroll before the exam,
 I wasn't really looking.
 So, what of it all of a sudden?
 Y-You've got to be kidding…?
 For all we know…
 there may not be any Heaven scrolls.
 What do you mean, Sakura?
 Well, in this second exam…
 four of the five-day time limit have passed already.
 So that means we've already used eighty percent of the total exam time.
 Seventy-eight participants and twenty-six teams.
 There are only thirteen each of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.
 At most there are only thirteen passing teams.
 Moreover, you remember, don’t you, Sasuke?
 That the Orochimaru guy burned  the “Heaven scroll” that we had.
 Which means…
 The teams that will pass had already, at that point, decreased by one.
 Hmm?
 Also, all of the other scrolls are not necessarily safe, so…
 After parting ways with the Leaf Village bunch,
 we allotted two days for healing…
 So from here on, we have to increase the distance of our actions.
 At any rate, the next enemy is our last chance.
 I'm going to get some drinking water.
 Say! Say!
 I have a good way for us not to fight with an enemy. Believe it!
 What?!
 Get serious!
 I am serious.
 I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.
 Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual, for notes….
 If we tweak this a little and change it into exactly like the Heaven scroll…
 H-Hold it!
 Huh?
 Even if you did such a thing, you don't know what's written on the inside!
 If the Proctor looked inside you will be discovered right away!
 Idiot!
 Generally with things like this,
 there's a password or something written
 and you can’t get it unless you have both scrolls.
 In other words…
 to pass at the tower goal, we'll surely need a password.
 Or something like that. Believe it!
 What difference does it make?
 If you don't know the content, there's no use making a fake!
 Man, here I was wondering what you were going to say, looking all big…
 You're an idiot who just can't think through things.
 B-But…
 What if we could predict the content…?
 This Earth scroll…
 You wouldn't…
 I'm going to…open this scroll!
 No!
 You! Have you forgotten even the rules, you idiot?
 We were told not to look inside the scrolls until arriving at the tower, right?
 But, at this rate, we’ll be in a hot spot, right?
 There might be a trap or something.
 Carefully… Be careful.
 Yeah.
 I know…
 Hey, what's wrong?
 Hey!
 What's wrong?
 What happened?!
 Hey!
 Hey! 					Answer me!
 You'd best not do it.
 An enemy?
 Man, you're beyond saving…
 That was close.
 W-We're sorry.
 Those who ignored the rules are forced into the situation of having to retire.
 In the previous exam, hypnotism Jutsu Formula was set up to
 get into the eyes of those who looked at the scroll along the way.
 A measure to get them to lie in the forest until the end of the exam.
 By the way…
 If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?
 What're you doing hanging around here alone?
 It's not that I'm after your scroll.
 I didn't think so.
 If that was your intention… you could've taken it from Naruto just now.
 So you're also after the Heaven scroll?
 No.
 I already have them both.
 See?
 What?
 Things led to things…
 I was hurrying over to the vicinity of the tower
 to wait for my estranged companions.
 Now, if you'll excuse me…
 Wait!
 Fight me.
 Lucky!
 Fight you, you say?
 S-Sasuke.
 This idiot-suke.
 What are you saying suddenly?
 Are you serious?
 Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.
 Hey, Sasuke! Kabuto saved us!
 Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.
 Shut up!
 Sasu…ke.
 It can't be helped. I said it before, too.
 This is all that can be done to survive through this forest now.
 Hmm…That's a lie.
 A lie?
 Your heart isn't totally in this as much as you're saying.
 If you could really become serious about this exam…
 Why is it necessary to fight me?
 You should jump on me at my unguarded moment,
 without going to the trouble of announcing it.
 That's…a Ninja.
 Hmm, that's profound.
 I don't dislike that side of you.
 So I shall tell you the way you should go.
 However…let's talk as we move.
 The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke had reached a great distance.
 At this rate, we'll be marked by fierce animals…and enemies.
 Humph!
 Are there really still enemies around?
 Yes, no mistake.
 If you think about it a little, you'll understand.
 Do you know the cleverest way of fighting in battles
 in jungles and expansive forests such as this?
 No.
 The tower located in the center of this forest,
 the common goal for us test-takers.
 That means when the last day of the test is here…
 the area near that tower is the easiest place to gather scrolls.
 Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right?
 In other words, we go after the scrolls of the teams
 that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls and are setting out for the tower.
 That's one-third of the answer.
 What?
 I mean that you guys are not the only ones thinking that!
 Near the tower, the same badgers have probably already set traps, so…
 I see!
 That means there are lots of enemies lying in wait to engage us.
 Heh, having a handicap gets me pumped, I say!
 I'm looking forward to it!
 If we just beat them all and get the Heaven scroll,
 we'll all survive the second exam!
 No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!
 What's the remaining one-third of the answer?
 The collectors who are certain to appear during an exam of this nature.
 Collectors?
 In this exam, with the tower just a stone's throw away,
 you definitely can't rest easy…
 Those particular conditions are what create them.
 In other words, those who gather extra scrolls…
 as compensation for sparing them when coming across an unexpected enemy.
 Also, those who get information to proceed favorably through later exams
 by providing the lacking scrolls to comrades sharing the same village.
 And those who are thinking of, under conditions favorable to them,
 annihilating the powerful ones who will probably get through to the third exam.
 It goes without saying, but these guys are quite the big guns
 and the worst enemies who are definitely not conceited.
 I see.
 I understand the reason why you appeared before us.
 You're scared, too, right?
 That's right.
 Now then, the tower has finally come into view.
 From here on is the hard part.
 All right, let's go!
 An enemy already?
 There!
 Oh, it's just a centipede.
 Yikes! It's huge.
 All those legs are gross.
 Naruto.
 Huh?
 I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and careless actions from here on.
 Huh?
 Rushing ahead through a dense forest making noise like an elephant
 is the same as serving notice in a loud voice that we're coming.
 We'd definitely receive an enthusiastic welcome.
 O-Oh, I see.
 As long as time allows, we should go slowly while remaining hidden.
 – Yeah. 					– Okay.
 Sure.
 Heh, not bad, everyone.
 Oh?
 Okay, it's this way.
 Is it a trap?
 Yeah.  It'll get intense ahead from here on.
 Kabuto!
 H-Huh?
 That was close, Naruto.
 Substitution Jutsu!
 I told you, it would get intense ahead from here on.
 I've…had it…
 Oh! Sakura!
 For crying out loud, how far have we walked?
 The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
 Here we can see it right in front of our eyes.
 Strange…
 No mistake about it.
 It seems that we're already within the enthusiastic welcome.
 Take a look at that.
 Oh, that can't be!
 What on earth is going on?
 No way!
 Is it Genjutsu…?
 So it seems.
 We were lured in perfectly.
 It appears we were meticulously careful,
 and were made to walk around the same place in a circle.
 We're being watched…
 Probably.
 They intend to wear down our physical strength and
 catch us unprepared when we're bone-tired.
 If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
 Then... they'll be coming soon.
 They’ve appeared.
 Hah!
 This is the perfect handicap.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What's with these guys?
 Crawling out all of a sudden?
 Fighting in numbers isn't necessarily a good thing, you know?
 Since it's come to this,
 it'll be a comparison of the number of Clone Jutsu.
 I can get twice of twice of twice of twice of your...
 Anyway, I'll multiply to an incredible number!
 It doesn't matter if it's your Genjutsu or whatever.
 I'll kick all their butts!

 Oh!
 Good morning, Sakura!
 Hmph!
 Oh, not again!
 These two...
 They've been sort of strange since we got back from the Land of Waves…
 Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...
 Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!
 Cha!
 Well... Good morning, everyone...
 Today I got lost.
 Hey!
 Hey, hey...  Kakashi Sensei!
 Our Group Seven always has the easy missions lately!
 Aren't there more exciting missions where I can be more active,
 where I can use my Way of the Ninja and my soul…you know?
 Oh yes yes...
 I basically understand what you're trying to say.
 Shoot!
 He's always making me indebted to him
 and making himself look good during our missions!
 I won't lose, no way!
 You little...!
 Today for sure!
 Hmm... You are so much trouble!
 That's what I'd like to say!
 Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto? We're going on our mission!
 Okay!
 You've been so annoying for a while!
 I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!
 Hey you!
 What?
 Oh, Mrs.!
 I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
 What?
 What's wrong?
 Those... those aren't weeds.
 Huh?
 Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
 Ouch, ouch, ouch!

 That's the trap field over there…
 Yikes!
 Well! It's because you're so reckless!
 Geez, you are so much trouble.
 Zazuge--!
 If you act up any more, I'll finish you!
 Mmm… Teamwork hasn't been good lately.
 That's right, that's right!
 Sasuke, you're to blame for the poor teamwork!
 You're always attracting attention!
 That's you, you idiot.
 If you don't want to owe me big time...
 you just need to become stronger than me!
 It seems like they're getting along worse than before...
 Shoot… 					This is frustrating!
 There're plenty of guys outside who are stronger than I am…
 Always making me go on this kind of lame mission.
 Well then...
 Perhaps we should disperse.
 I do need to submit a report about this mission.
 Okay, then I'm going home.
 Oh! Hey!
 Sasuke, wait for me!
 Hey, how about... Why don't you and…
 Why don't we work on improving our teamwork together?

 LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!! 		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto! 		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
 That's right…
 It's always that way for me during every mission.
 I'll never be able to really do anything at all.
 Sakura! Just let Sasuke be, and let's practice together!
 Huh?

 Huh?

 So, I have formally received the report from you.
 Is Naruto getting along with the others?
 Hmm?
 Well, he's doing okay.
 I've been busy lately.
 I haven't had a chance to see him even once since his return.
 I'm a little concerned...
 As you know, Iruka Sensei, Sasuke is also in our squad,
 and Naruto sees him as a rival, which is a little straining.
 But, the result is that his abilities are developing significantly.
 Almost to the point that he might reach yours,
 the one he respects!
 I see…
 I wonder what it is?
 Shoot!
 Right now?
 These guys…
 Konohamaru!
 That hurt, little punk!
 Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!
 I'm sorry… I was fooling around…
 What are these two?
 Hey stop! Let go of that hand!
 Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...
 Let's play with them before the strict one comes around.
 Let go!
 You're pretty lively, you little punk...
 You jerk!
 Wha--?! 					What was that?
 Leaf Village's Genin are weaker than I thought.
 T-These guys are foreign...
 Why are they here?
 Konohamaru…
 Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru!
 It... It hurts …
 Hey! If you don't let go of him, I won't forgive you! You fool!
 You're the fool!
 What are you gonna do by getting him worked up!
 You're ticking me off.
 I-I don't like little runts anyway.
 On top of that,
 you're a smart aleck for someone younger than me.
 Makes me want to break him.
 It's not on me.
 What's with this guy? He's crazy…
 Well, after this little squirt, it's the little runt that won't shut up!
 You!
 Huh?
 What do you think you're doing in someone else's Village, you…
 Sasuke!
 He's pretty cute.
 Bro!
 Another little punk to tick me off!
 Get lost!
 Wow! So cool!
 Naruto, you're lame!
 S-Stupid! I would've quickly taken down that thug too!
 Hmph!
 Sasuke, you!
 Why're you always, always meddling like this!
 Hey, come down here,  you little punk!
 You're the kind of smart aleck little punk that I despise the most.
 Wait! You aren't thinking of using Crow, are you?!
 Kankuro, stop that.
 Huh?
 You're an embarrassment to our village.
 G-Gaara...
 When did he get next to me?
 It's stealthy footsteps on the level of Kakashi...
 There is no other reason to summon you here other than…
 As I assume you already understand,
 based on the faces you can see around...
 So it's already that time...
 The other Lands have already been notified, right?
 I've seen them here and there in the village.
 And, when will it be?
 In a week...
 That's very sudden.
 Now… I will make the formal announcement.
 Seven days from today…
 On the first day of July, the Chunin Exam will begin!
 Yes, yes, yes!
 It's the Chunin Exam, it's the Chunin Exam!
 If I were to win first place or something, becoming a Hokage would be closer!
 There's no way I can lose!
 Konohamaru, you think so too, right?
 What?
 Who the heck snatched up Moegi, and what 're you gonna do?
 Stop, I won't let you get away!
 Next time:  ""Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals""
 As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!

175,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Hasn’t this increased since last month?
 Yes, it has.
 It’s now widely known in distant lands
 that you were appointed to Hokage, Lady Tsunade.
 Bills have started to come in addressed to the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 Hokage is not something to take on.
 My name is Tsunade…
 I’m the Fifth Hokage of the Village Hidden in Leaves.
 My concern now is a debt that absolutely will not go down…
 And…
 Grandma Tsunade!
 – Hey wait! 					– Naruto!
 – Lemme go! 					– Calm down!
 If there aren’t any missions, let me go search for Sasuke!
 You’ve been told to train, haven’t you, Naruto?!
 Grandma Tsunade!
 That…
 The Treasure Hunt is On!
 I won’t let you through!
 Goal!
 Too bad.
 But it’s totally obvious since it’s the same person doing it.
 There haven’t been any missions lately, either.
 I wonder if the Pervy Sage will come back soon…
 I can’t train by myself…
 What, there was someone here before me?
 Huh? Kiba… Akamaru…
 Here I thought I could take my time to train.
 Are you by yourself? Where are Hinata and Shino?
 Shino is backing up another team with Kurenai Sensei…
 Hinata said she’d train at home.
 Is it like we’ve lost our jobs?
 Don’t say that… I’ll feel empty-hearted…
 Naruto! Kiba!
 Hinata…
 Weren’t you training at home?
 There was a call from the Hokage. She wants us to come immediately.
 Then…
 All right! Our first mission in a while!
 Treasure hunting?
 That’s right. This person here, an old acquaintance of mine,
 is our client this time around…
 My name is Agari Kaisen.
 Please look at this.
 This is a map indicating the location of the treasure.
 It seems a treasure worth several hundred million ryo lies buried there.
 S-Several hundred million?!
 If I were to eat Ichiraku’s special portion ramen everyday…
 I don’t think you could eat all that even if you spent your whole life eating…
 Awesome!
 But it’s on the map, right?
 Is this a job to go to the trouble of asking Shinobi to do?
 Yes. The treasure is in a location difficult for ordinary people to get to.
 Even I tried getting there… but there was no way.
 So it’s the Shinobi’s turn, huh?
 The deadline is in three days.
 If you succeed, there will be a special reward from Agari.
 Set out with caution!
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 Heh! A mission like this is a cinch!
 Indeed, it isn’t a difficult mission.
 However… if you fail…!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 – Yay, yay! 					– Hey, wait!
 If you fail…
 you will go back to the Academy!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 You’ll re-enroll in the Academy
 and re-do your Ninja training from square one.
 Wh-Why us…?
 I looked up your mission success rate over these past few months…
 Naruto! You’re decisively poor!
 What?!
 In particular, the success rate when you team up
 with Kiba Inuzuka and Hinata Hyuga is hopelessly low!
 Now that she mentions it,
 it’s the members we failed an earlier mission with…
 We also failed before when four of us, including Shino,
 went looking for Bikochu Beetles…
 Something rings familiar, right?
 But, just Naruto aside,
 why should we also have to go back to the Academy…?
 Collective responsibility is fundamental in Ninja teams.
 Everyone takes responsibility for a failure.
 Got it?!
 It…it’ll be okay. No way should we fail at hunting for treasure…
 If you don’t drag us down.
 What?! Don’t you be dragging us down!
 If we fail… we’ll have to study with these kids, right…?
 Hey, what’s up?
 Naruto, Kiba, Hinata, all three of you together?
 Iruka Sensei…
 You guys must have come to miss the Academy, huh?
 You could come back if you like.
 I’ll never go back!
 What’s with them…?
 I’ll make this mission a success no matter what
 and put Grandma Tsunade to shame!
 And I’ll have no part of going back…
 to the Academy on account of associating with you.
 The failures until now are a collective responsibility.
 It’s not just my responsibility!
 I don’t know about that.
 The success rate of our team without you in it is high.
 Then I’ll prove on this mission
 who it is who really drags us down, believe it!
 That’s just what I want.
 I wonder if this will be okay?
 It’s a dead-end!
 So this is as far as there’s a path, huh…?
 There’s a river up ahead. How should we cross it…?
 Then, here here. We should cut straight through, right?!
 Are you an idiot? Mountain terrain isn’t that simple.
 I would go…this way.
 Are you an idiot? That’s totally the long way around.
 Then you want to compete to see which is faster?
 No way will I lose!
 All right! The finish line is that boulder!
 Start! Let’s go, Akamaru!
 This will be a cinch!
 What? What?
 Wait, Naruto!
 Naruto…
 What?
 It seems we’re climbing up quite a bit…
 It’s okay!
 Naruto!
 It’s…okay.
 We should be totally faster than Kiba, so…!
 Yes! I win!
 Something smells good…
 Huh?
 So you finally made it, huh?
 Kiba!
 You were so late I went ahead and got some food ready…
 Now then… which way?
 We should… we should just cut right though this!
 Naruto!
 Good grief…
 W-Water…
 Here, water.
 This way’s definitely faster!
 I sure slept well.
 Akamaru and I often train in mountains like this…
 We know a lot more about the mountains than you guys.
 Shut up!
 Shut up, I say!
 Don’t be acting all big just because you won two or three times!
 Not two or three times. Five times!
 S-Stop it! Naruto! Kiba!
 Naruto and the others should be there pretty soon, huh…?
 This mission looks easy at a glance.
 But it won’t go that easily…
 They’ll probably realize that.
 A limestone cave, huh…?
 But…
 Geez, hurry up already!
 You said the buried treasure is in a limestone cave, right?
 Just a minute!
 The limestone cave is supposed to be further ahead.
 We shouldn’t have been able to find it this easily…
 It’s not like there are that many limestone caves!
 So here’s fine…
 Let’s go, Hinata.
 R-Right…
 H-Hey, wait, you two!
 I can’t see anything…
 Oh, it’s a dead-end…
 It can’t be!
 Naruto! Hinata!
 Look out! Run, you two!
 Wha--?
 This…couldn’t be over…
 That person said it’d be okay at just this extent…
 What happened…?
 By any chance, was an enemy after us?
 No…Akamaru’s saying he didn’t smell anyone.
 It was probably just an accident…
 I told you this wasn’t the right place!
 But, as a person, if you’re looking for a limestone cave
 and there’s one right in front of you,
 one would usually think that’s the place, right?!
 Don’t be getting smart with me. Here I saved your butt!
 I didn’t ask you to save me.
 What?!
 Hey… you two…
 A shard from the ceiling hit you, huh…?
 You okay?
 It seems I’m the one dragging us down…
 Not at all! lf I had been more cautious…
 At the end of the day, it’s your fault, Naruto.
 Kiba!
 Nevertheless, I’ll have no part of going back to the Academy
 on account of associating with you, Naruto…
 Akamaru and I will find the treasure.
 What’re you saying, Kiba?!
 There’s no point if we don’t all do it together!
 I’m…okay, so…
 From here on, there will be locations all along the way so rough
 they are beyond comparison to those up until this point…
 It’ll be nothing but places that really only a Shinobi can get through!
 It’d be absolutely impossible for someone with an injured leg.
 Oh…
 Besides… we can’t just leave someone who’s injured, right?
 We need someone to stay with her.
 Then it doesn’t have to be me…
 Can you find the treasure by yourself?
 You can’t read a map worth a damn and you don’t know the mountains…
 To be straight…
 we’ve wasted a ton of time on your account, so!
 Rest easy.
 After I find the treasure,
 you won’t have to go back to the Academy…
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 H-Hey! Wait, Kiba!
 Damn it…!
 Now.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 Are you awake, Naruto?
 Hinata…
 Naruto!
 There are…two Hinatas!
 Naruto…
 Naruto…
 Hinata, did you use a Clone Jutsu?
 Could it be… you were twins?!
 – No! 					– No!
 Then…
 One of you transformed into Hinata with a Transformation Jutsu, huh…?
 I can’t…tell you apart at all…
 I’m the real one!
 I’m the real one!
 Your voices are also exactly the same!
 I know.
 At a time like this,
 I should ask a question that only the real one knows.
 I'll come right out and ask! What’s Hinata’s father’s name?
 – Hiashi Hyuga. – Hiashi Hyuga.
 Oh, yeah. As for me, I didn’t know Hinata’s father’s name.
 What?!
 – Naruto… 					– Naruto…
 At a time like this, if Kiba and Akamaru were here…
 Here they could tell by smell which one is the real one…
 Nope. It’d be impossible even for a Ninja Hound…
 What?
 This isn’t just an ordinary Transformation Jutsu, so…
 Mister…As I recall, you’re the client this time around…
 What are you doing here?
 It wasn’t buried treasure that I wanted…
 It was your faces.
 Faces…?
 I already got…your face…
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki!
 That’s…me…
 I guess I’ll be setting out to get the last face…
 Leave it to me!
 This is the place…
 This inside of the cave is as the map says…
 There’s no doubt.
 It’s under this rock, huh? I’ll go in one shot!
 Huh?
 This, huh…? I found it surprisingly easy.
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Kiba? That’s you there, isn’t it, Kiba?
 Kiba…?
 Naruto…Hinata…
 I told you guys to go on back first, didn’t I?!
 Come on! Come on! Here we went to the trouble of coming!
 This mission is for the three of us, so…
 Hinata… is your injury okay?
 Yeah…I became able to move after resting a bit, so…
 Wow! You already found the treasure?!
 Then let’s take it back to the village quick!
 Right…
 Wait… How did they get here so fast without a map?
 And moreover, Naruto has zero sense of direction…
 And Hinata has an injured leg…
 Akamaru…doesn’t seem to be feeling any particular suspicion.
 Am I being paranoid…?
 It seems they’re back.
 Kiba! Akamaru!
 Heh! Didn’t we tell you?
 Even a Ninja Hound's nose can’t tell the difference…
 Let’s begin.
 Face Copying Jutsu!
 What’s that…?
 We also copied faces like this.
 As you can see,
 when performing the Face Copying Jutsu,
 the person being copied must be close by.
 And moreover, it takes a degree of time.
 But once a face has been copied once, it’s an impeccable Transformation Jutsu
 that is beyond even a family’s recognition.
 No way…
 Kiba! Wake up! Kiba!
 Wh-What the hell are you…?!
 I’m Kiba Inuzuka.
 You guys…
 What’s the big idea?!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 Those are the real ones, huh…?
 Who the hell are you guys?
 The name of our clan is the Kedouin Clan.
 We’re a clan that possesses the secret Face Copying Jutsu.
 Why our faces?
 We’re going to return to the Village Hidden in Leaves in your place,
 and mess up the village good!
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Like I said,
 nothing good ever comes from a mission together with you, Naruto.
 This isn’t the time to be complaining.
 They’re intending to head for the village.
 Then, how do we get out of here?
 – Listen. – With Rasengan, I’ll…
 No good. They’ll notice.
 – I can… – Then use your Fang-Over-Fang.
 – It’d be the same, you idiot. – That's why I said…
 – Then, what do we do? – Use that, I’m telling you…
 Naruto!
 – Don’t stop me, Hinata. – Don’t stop me, Hinata.
 Not that, I mean I’ll…
 – Oh, that. 					– Oh, that.
 Next time: “Run, Dodge, Zigzag! Chase or be Chased!”

 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 Look, Papa!
 What is it, Kunihisa?
 Look, it’s sparkly and pretty.
 That’s right, Kunihisa.
 Even though it’s so pretty, how can it have no value…
 That’s horrible, isn’t it, Papa?
 Impossible! Celebirty Ninja Art: Money Style Jutsu!
 A-Are you serious, Grandma Tsunade!
 Calm down!
 Sorry, I’ll calm down.
 Since he is an important person,
 I believe there is no one appropriate for the job other than you.
 Finally… Finally a mission appropriate for my abilities.
 Guarding an important person… lt has such a nice ring to it!
 Listen seriously!
 Gotcha.
 Okay, about this mission…
 Shizune.
 Yes!
 The details are written in those documents.
 His name’s Kunihisa, he lives in the capital.
 He’s the heir of an old acquaintance of mine.
 Your acquaintance, Grandma Tsunade?
 Yes, his father’s name is Kunijiro.
 He made his fortune in one generation. He’s a successful jeweler.
 The heir of a jeweler…
 Hey, Papa?
 Is this real, too?
 Of course it’s real, little Kuni.
 So, is that and that and this and the one over there too?!
 Of course, little Kuni!
 Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
 Suddenly my motivation is boosted!
 I’ll do it! I’ll do that mission!
 So where is this Kunihisa at, Grandma Tsunade?!
 Come in!
 – Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! – Wow! What’s this brat?
 Ninja! Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!
 Ninja?
 Don’t add that question mark at the end of your sentence, don’t!
 So it must be you!
 You are the kid who’s going with Kunihisa to play be a-Ninja-for-a-day…
 I’ll leave him to you, then.
 What? Be a Ninja for a day…?
 My little Kuni really admires Ninja,
 and he aggravates me by saying nothing but Ninja everyday.
 Grandma Tsunade!
 Wasn’t this the guarding-important-person mission?!
 What are you talking about?
 I did say he’s an important person,
 but didn’t say a word about guarding him.
 I was fooled! Grandma!
 Naruto Uzumaki!
 I order you to play be a-Ninja-for-a-day with Kunihisa!
 Damn… That’s a dirty trick, Grandma!
 Oh, there’s one more thing.
 I added your regular missions as a service.
 Oh, that’s cruel, Grandma Tsunade!
 Clean the pond, repair the bridge, get rid of the savage pig,
 and…
 It turns out that babysitting is just added to the regular D-rank missions!
 Ninja, Ninja.
 Watch this, Kunihisa!
 I’ll teach you the awesomeness of a Ninja.
 Hey, awesome Naruto! Awesome!
 It’s “be-a-Ninja-for-a-day,” isn’t it?
 So Kunihisa, you gather garbage from over there, too.
 Okay!
 Oh, that’s right. Don’t go into the marsh.
 This marsh is bottomless,
 so once you’re caught, you can’t get out.
 Huh, what?
 – Oh, no, Young Master is in trouble! – Naruto!
 What are you doing?!
 You fool! I’ll save you, so you stay right there!
 Fool! I’ll be fine.
 You’ll be fine?
 I can handle this kind of simple task with my Ninjutsu.
 Ninjutsu?
 – Oh no! Young Master! – Oh, no!
 Alligator snapping turtle, Piranha, Toad!
 Money Style:
 Help Me Jutsu!
 What?!
 – Yay! 					– Mine!
 Wha--?! Wh-Wh-Wha--?!
 I’m fine!
 What are you guys doing?!
 If you want money hurry up and rescue me.
 What good would increasing the victims do?
 Hey, Kunihisa.
 Huh?
 Who are they?
 Oh, them…
 Papa employs them and they protect me if I get into trouble.
 Really.
 That’s right, for example…
 There!
 See!
 What do you mean “see”?!
 Is it okay?
 I said it’s okay!
 Really, really okay?
 What are you so freaked out about? lt’s okay!
 But still, it’s scary!
 Cut the bull and come here now!
 R-Right!
 But just before that…
 Ninja Art: Scapegoat Jutsu!
 See? It’s fine. C’mere, quick!
 If I get on it next, I think it might break…
 Let’s check out a bunch more.
 I’m not finished yet! More of you!
 Go!
 What the--?!
 Just as I thought.
 I thought I was gonna die.
 What were you doing, Kunihisa?!
 What would have happened if I’d got on the bridge like that?
 C’mon you!
 Okay everyone, your compensation!
 Here!
 I’m telling you, stop that!
 That kid… He’s got money, huh, Big Brother.
 Yeah… And his main guard is a single Genin.
 Big Brother, it’s decided.
 Yeah.
 What’s next?
 Get rid of the savage pig who appears in the field ahead.
 Okay! I’ll do my best!
 What the--?!
 A savage pig…?
 More like a monster!
 Crap!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 That’s cool!
 Naruto!
 Okay! It’s my turn this time!
 F-Fool! What are you doing? Hurry up and escape!
 Here I go!
 Ninja Art: Money Clone Jutsu!
 Money Clone?!
 Huh?!
 Hey, you ugly savage pig!
 Starting now, I, Kunihisa, will punish you!
 Go!
 Go! Get him! There!
 What, nobody wants to eat your meat! You dummy!
 He ordered all of this!
 What?!
 I didn’t want to, but he forced me to…
 Huh? W-Wait…
 That’s a lie. It’s a misunderstanding!
 Those are false charges!
 Forgive me! Naruto…
 I… How should I put this…?
 really hate guys like you!
 Why are you getting so testy?
 Geez, poor people just can’t help that they have short tempers…
 This’ll put you back in a good mood.
 Take as much as you want!
 Enough already!
 I’m telling you to stop doing stuff like that!
 Why?
 It’s a big mistake to think that anything can be resolved with money!
 There are times when you have to use your own power!
 There hasn’t been anything that I couldn’t do with money so far!
 You… Are you always like this?
 With that personality, you can’t make friends!
 It’s okay ‘cause I can buy friends with money!
 What…?
 You… Buy friends? You mean…
 If I give ‘em money, everybody will be my friend!
 Kunihisa…
 That’s why I hate country Ninjas.
 They’re cheap and stink of poverty…
 Stupid!
 Oh, please wait, Master Kunihisa!
 Running made me hungry.
 Take this and buy a boxed lunch!
 There’s nothing like a store to buy lunch around here.
 Well, snacks will be fine!
 There’s no convenient store or candy shop…
 You’re useless! This is why I hate the country!
 Stupid Naruto.
 What’s that?
 Oh, Young Master!
 Oh!
 Little fish, little fish!
 Let’s eat!
 The kid must be stupid to get caught in this cheap trick.
 Don’t you agree, Bro?
 Yeah!
 Huh? Naruto?!
 Aw man, you’re really high maintenance.
 Those two guys just now…
 They were going to catch you!
 They were plotting a kidnapping, whatever…
 Whatever…?
 I’m often a target, because I have money.
 Often a target…? You…
 More importantly, I want to eat more fish!
 Go find a shop and buy some.
 You… Still think you can do anything with money?
 All right, watch this!
 Yay! Awesome! Awesome Naruto!
 How’s that?!
 You can just get things using your own power without using money.
 Even… without using money?
 Damn!
 He attacked us by surprise, that cowardly bastard.
 I’ll give it back to him doubled!
 Well, wait…
 If we do it thoughtlessly, we’ll just get creamed again.
 So what do we do?
 We’ll use that thing.
 That thing…?
 Look close at the movement of the fish…
 Aim for the instant when they fall after jumping up.
 Don’t get hasty.
 Now!
 Oh!
 That was close!
 O-One more time, Naruto!
 I’ll get the Kunai knife, so one more time!
 Master Kunihisa!
 – It’s deep over there! – Please be careful!
 I know, I know…
 Where did it go?
 I think it’s in this area, but…
 I won’t let you get away this time!
 You guys…
 We hired these guys with the money you threw away.
 It means that now, they’re on our side…
 Hey, you guys! I’ll pay you double what those guys did!
 So be on my side…
 Wh-What the…?
 Looks like you’ve run out of money.
 How about you guys over there? Wanna join us?
 We’ll pay up stacks of money.
 Humph! These guys have been with me for a long time.
 That paltry sum won’t…
 We’re not going along with your selfish acts any longer!
 Y-You guys?!
 No! I don’t like it!
 Annoying brat. I’ll have to tie you up so you won’t move.
 What are you doing, Kunihisa?!
 Naruto, I… I…
 It’s fine already!
 Hey you… I’ll pay you double what you get for your mission.
 Won’t you hand that brat over to us?
 We’re just going to demand ransom money from his parents is all.
 We won’t kill him. Relax and hand him over.
 I-It’s not enough? Here, how about this?
 Naruto…
 Kunihisa! Ride on my back!
 O-Okay.
 S-Still not enough, huh? Here! That’s all of it! Take it!
 Like I said…
 It’s a big mistake to think you can obtain anything with money!
 Crap!
 After them!
 Listen! Hold on tightly Kunihisa.
 Okay!
 Damn! I can’t move with him on my back!
 I can’t see the bottom, Naruto…
 Go!
 Okay! You go on ahead.
 What?! Go on ahead?!
 There he is! Let’s get him!
 – Yeah! 					– Yeah!
 Wh-What are you doing?!
 It’s okay! Hurry up and jump!
 I-I can’t… I’m scared, Naruto!
 It’s not scary, c’mon!
 I can’t… I’m scared…!
 Damn it!
 Do it!
 Naruto!
 Well, you’re coming with me!
 Hurry! Kunihisa!
 B-But……
 It’s okay… You can definitely do this! Believe it!
 Prepare yourself!
 No way!
 Go Kunihisa!
 Oh, Big Brother!
 Huh?! Kunihisa?!
 It hurts!
 I’m going to clean those guys out and then I’ll be right over!
 So wait a second!

 D-Darudo!
 The wall’s collapsing… Escape!
 How long are you guys gonna be on top of me!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Wh-Wh-What’s going on?!
 I have to go to him!
 There are times when you have to use your own power!
 Use my own…power!
 You can just get things using your own power with out using money.
 Even without money…
 with my own power!
 I can…do this!
 Just one step short!
 Naruto!
 Kunihisa!
 No! A little bit more!
 – We did it! 					– We did it!
 All right!
 I-It hurts but… I’m scared but…
 I…!
 You… What a face?!
 Kunihisa…
 You did a good job!
 Darudo!
 Wha--?! Hold on, don’t drip snot!
 But Naruto!
 Stop it!
 Well… See ya!
 Yeah! Next time you come play at my house, Naruto!
 Okay!
 Really… You took great care of him. Thank you!
 Yeah, well…
 Well then…
 Yes…
 Papa, Papa!
 What is it, little Kuni?
 Look, it’s sparkly and pretty…
 But it has no value, it’s just a marble, little Kuni.
 That’s true, Papa…
 But…
 As long as it's pretty, it doesn't matter whether it's valueless, right?
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.

 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 All right, I’m fired up! Our mission this time is a treasure hunt!
 But your recent low mission success rate concerns me.
 No need to worry. We’ve got a map, so it’ll be a cinch!
 I’ve thought about it, you see…
 No need to think, believe it!
 If you fail this mission…
 It’ll be okay, I tell you!
 You’ll all start over again from the Academy!

 Assassin of the Moonlit Night
 T-This guy…
 Sasuke!
 So we were too late…
 Those guys…
 Sa…Sakura…?
 You guys…
 T-This…
 He probably fought recklessly…
 like that time!
 Sasuke!
 Kakashi Sensei said there was nothing to worry about with the bruise!
 So tell me…Sakura…
 Sakura!
 What do you want?!
 This guy… Who is he?!
 His outward appearance is different, but…
 he’s that guy called Gaara.
 When I came into this world, I took the life of the woman some might call my mother.
 So that I could become the strongest Shinobi…
 my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
 and so I became possessed by a Sand Spirit.
 I was born a monster.
 So that's what he was saying…
 He’s the one who hurt Sasuke…
 Hey young girl!
 I want you to know that I’m not the fighting type!
 I can see that by looking at you!
 In any case, I need to get away from here
 and somehow take Sasuke to where Kakashi Sensei is!
 You…
 Sasuke…!
 Well! Your limit is two shots…
 That’s about it…
 The third shot won’t be activated… Remember this well.
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
 not only will the Jutsu not properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
 and in the worst case, you’ll die!
 Even if you were to survive, absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case…
 Is it the Curse Mark…?
 If you let your hatred take over you,
 and rely on the power of the Curse Mark…
 your development will stop there.
 If that happens, you won’t be able to beat Itachi.
 In any case, I need to get control over this.
 Sasuke!
 I see you’re…
 the one I failed to kill that time.
 I live fighting for only myself and loving myself…
 And as long as there are others to kill…
 I will never disappear.
 L-Let’s run! Everyone!
 Die! Sasuke Uchiha!
 Sakura!
 Out of the way!
 Sakura!
 How could she stand in the way of that Gaara…?
 Darn! Darn! What the heck should we do?!
 Just with him, I don’t want to…
 Now, let me feel it!
 Why…?
 Gaara, Please calm down.
 It’s no use after all…
 The sand gets in the way.
 Gaara…
 Yashamaru!
 I may not look it,
 but Lord Kazekage charged me to look after your physical condition
 as a member of medical corps and to be with you.
 Please do not do such things in front of me.
 Although the sand will protect you…
 Yashamaru… I’m sorry…
 Oh, this..? It’s just a scrape.
 A scrape…
 Is it painful?
 A little bit… But it’ll heal in no time.
 Hey Yashamaru…
 What is it?
 What is pain?
 I’ve…never once had a wound so…
 I wondered what it’s like…
 Well…
 How can I explain it?
 It’s like it’s distressing, or difficult…
 In other words, to be hit or cut…
 Maybe I should say it’s a feeling of not being able to bear it,
 of not being able to stay normal…
 I can’t say it well,
 but I suppose it means a situation that’s not very good.
 Yashamaru…
 Yes?
 So, do you dislike me…Yashamaru?
 People live their lives while hurting others and while being hurt.
 But it’s not so easy for people to dislike others.
 Thank you, Yashamaru.
 I think I sort of understand what pain is now.
 I see…
 So…maybe I’m injured too? The same as everyone?
 I'm always…in pain.
 I’m not bleeding, but…
 I’ve been having a lot of pain around…here.
 Blood does flow from a wound on the body
 and the wound may appear painful.
 But as time passes, the pain naturally disappears.
 By using medicine, the healing is even faster.
 But what’s dangerous is a wound of the heart.
 Nothing has more trouble healing.
 A wound of the heart?
 A wound on the body and a wound of the heart are slightly different.
 Unlike a wound on the body, there is no ointment and sometimes,
 it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.
 But there is one thing that can cure a wound of the heart.
 However, this is a complicated medicine.
 It can only be given to you by another person.
 What? What must I do to…?
 The thing that can cure a wound of the heart.
 That is…
 love.
 Love?
 Yes.
 H-How can I get it? What do I need to do for this pain to be…?
 It has already been given to you, Gaara.
 Huh?
 Love is…a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person, just like my older sister did.
 I believe that my older sister loved you, Gaara.
 Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living  person used for the purpose of attacks.
 The sand which automatically tries to protect you is like the love of a mother.
 I believe that sand is filled with your mother’s will.
 My sister…probably wanted to protect you even more after dying…
 Yashamaru…
 What is it?
 Thanks for what you did earlier… for stopping me.
 You are welcome.
 You are a precious person who is near me, Gaara!
 Can you understand…my pain?
 It tastes like iron…
 Twenty!
 Twenty-one!
 Leaf…Hurricane!
 How many did you take down Kakashi?
 Twenty-two.
 Huh, it seems I win again!
 That was my twenty-third.
 Yeah, yeah all right…
 That poser attitude of yours still makes you cool!
 That’s the reason you are my rival!
 – Let’s go! 					– All right!
 Hey, Yashamaru… I have a favor to ask!
 What is it?
 I want some ointment.
 Sorry about earlier… lt must’ve hurt.
 This is medicine.
 If you want it--
 Go home…freak!
 Oh, what the--?!
 Hey, be careful, you brat--
 Y-You are…
 – Again… 					– Go home, freak!
 These eyes…
 Y-You are…
 Why…? Why?!
 H-Hey!
 What the--? What’s going on?
 It’s…it’s Gaara!
 Hey! This guy's dead.
 Father…
 As I thought… Things don’t go well…
 Why is it…that only I’m such a freak?!
 What…am I?!
 The thing that can cure a wound of the heart is love.
 Yashamaru!
 Huh?
 Why? Why me…?
 Why always me?!
 Who…? Why…?
 Well done…Gaara.
 Yashamaru…!
 It’s those eyes…
 What’s the matter? Weren’t you gonna run away?
 Sasuke…
 Naruto…
 What are these two…to you?!
 T-These two are…my friends!
 Try laying so much as another finger on them!
 I’ll clobber you!
 So…what’s the matter?! Weren’t you gonna clobber me?
 Hurry up and come at me…
 Darn it!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 I know this guy’s strength.
 I may seem like a senseless weakling to him.
 But…what’s…? What’s this feeling welling up inside me?

 I don’t know, but I just don’t want to lose to this guy!

 Hah! There’s no way I’m going back!
 Let’s go!
 Right!
 What does that kid think he’s doing?
 Looks like he’s run away.
 Idate’s been like that from long ago.
 You know him?
 Yes, kind of…
 The Race is On! Trouble on the High Seas!
 I knew he’d run away, that bastard Idate.
 Knowing him this long, you must’ve figured this would happen.
 It was a mistake to let him run!
 You idiots! ldate isn’t that kind of kid!
 – Boss! 					– Boss…
 I believe in Idate.
 He must have a plan.

 Chief Retainer!
 How do you think you’re going to settle this?
 You've turned this grand traditional festival into a mere farce…
 And worse, in the presence of the lord!
 Sir, the race has just begun. Please watch it until the end.
 Since you insist that much, you had better win.
 If you lose…
 I’ll ask for the dissolution of your family!
 Agreed! I’m a man of my word.
 If Idate loses, you may do anything you wish.
 How like Wasabi’s Jirocho. Such confidence.
 Don't let us down.
 I’m counting on you, Idate.
 Boss…
 Give me your money!
 Just be still!
 A starving thief, huh…
 Sh-Shut up!
 A kid trying to act tough!
 With that little thing,
 you can’t even peel an apple, can you?!
 Here!
 Take this.
 Edged tools aren’t for hurting people.
 You don’t have anywhere to go, do you?
 I’m Jirocho of Wasabi of Degarashi Port.
 Wasabi…Jirocho?
 How about it? Why don’t you come to my place?
 I-I just tried to…
 Anyone on the verge of starvation will make such mistakes…
 I don’t hold it against you.
 Ah…this…
 I gave it to you. 					Keep it.
 Don’t ever do stupid things like stealing…
 M-Mister!
 Listen! Make me your henchman!
 No, I mean… could you please, Boss!
 What’s your name?
 Idate… My name is Idate Morino.
 Shall we go then, Idate?
 Boss, just trust in me! I will win, no matter what!
 We can catch up to him in a bit!
 But it’s too late now!
 He can’t win if he’s this far from the port!
 No, he may've planned to come this way from the very beginning.
 What?
 Huh?
 How lucky!
 Now, we can stop them here.
 At any rate…
 who would’ve thought they’d be escorting him.
 Double Lucky! Now I can pay them back.
 For what they did to us during the Chunin Exams.
 You two go ahead. I’ll keep them here.
 All right!
 Finally, we’ve caught up to you!
 Hey, wait!
 Geez! Why on earth did you come this way?!
 Shut up! lt’s none of your business!
 What kinda attitude is that?!
 I said to shut up!
 Watch out!
 They aren’t aware of it, are they?
 Of Genjutsu?
 Hey, I said wait up!
 I’ve already been here?
 Darn! Looks like I’ve been tricked by Genjutsu.
 Wha-?!
 If that’s the case…
 Release!
 There!
 H-Hey!
 No! Don’t go that way!
 Huh? What’s going on?
 I’m out of it!
 Just be still!
 We’ll get pulled up now!
 That was close…
 A double Genjutsu.
 Pretty elaborate trick.
 You idiot! It’s your fault that we’re going through all this!
 What did you say?!
 Hey, stop! Stop, I said!
 My Ninja tools!
 That was an unnecessary help!
 Did you say unnecessary?!
 Hey bastard, can’t you even thank us for saving you?!
 You saved me because it’s your duty!
 No need to thank you!
 What did you say?!
 Stop, Naruto. He’s right.
 But if you don’t want to die, you should stay close to us.
 Hey, where are you going?!
 Aren’t you going back to Port Degarashi?
 Stupid, I’m heading north from here!
 North? Is it faster that way?
 Yeah…
 Who knows… I really don’t trust this guy!
 This is why Ninja are no good.
 What?!
 At this time of year,
 a strong seasonal wind blows across this ocean…
 At the starting point, I watched the clouds and realized it…
 That the wind was coming.
 On top of that, at the port to the north,
 there’s an ocean current that flows straight to Nagi Island.
 This part is different from you guys. Right here!
 Looks like it’s getting a bit rough.
 Hey, don’t push it!
 Head more towards the south!
 But that’ll take up quite some time.
 Once we get on the land, no one can run faster than I can.
 My victory is already set!
 All right…
 I taste salt in the air.
 It’s the ocean!
 What is it that far out on the ocean?
 It’s the halfway point -- Nagi Island where Modoroki shrine is.
 I can get there within an hour. Wait for a sec.
 Hey, old man, I’m here! lt's Idate from the Wasabi Family!
 Ah, I’ve been waiting for you.
 Looks like I was right.
 I’ll need you to lend me a boat.
 I see. I have it ready.
 Use that boat.
 It’s the fastest boat around here.
 I'm grateful to you!
 No problem. Boss Jirocho has done so much for me.
 So, don’t lose to Wagarashi!
 I’m fed up with how they handle things.
 Leave it to me!
 I may be down on my luck now,
 but I'm Idate, the number one henchman of the Wasabi Family!
 Rest easy and leave it all to me!
 Yeah, right.
 We should start seeing Nagi Island’s port soon.
 I hope we can get there before Fukusuke.
 Hey, Naruto… What do you think?
 Hm? What about?
 That Idate…
 He’s definitely not an ordinary man.
 He can run extraordinarily fast.
 He could have received special training…
 What kind of training?
 Like, maybe he’d been in a hidden village.
 A guy that stupid can’t be a Ninja!
 Who’s talking here?! You're as stupid as he is!
 B-But…
 I made it to the final round of the Chunin Exam!
 You were in the final round of the Chunin Exam?!
 Yeah, that’ s right!
 If I weren’t interrupted in the middle of it,
 I could have won the tournament and become a Chunin!
 Hah!
 Then you must have had a darn easy proctor.
 Really, the level of the Chunin Exam has dropped…
 Oh!
 Idate, so you are…
 I remember now!
 Idate Morino.
 Morino… That’s right!
 Wasn’t the proctor of the first test….?
 Be quiet, you rotten runts!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting.
 I’m the proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 My name is Morino Ibiki.
 Morino… Ibiki…
 What did you say?
 Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!
 Yes…
 Of course, he’s alive!
 He gave me a weird problem on the 10th question…
 Is that true? He really is alive?!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 An ambush!
 How is it?
 As you can see, it’s right in front of us.
 Then, let’s get started on our plan!
 Darn!
 Naruto and I will chase them away!
 Sakura, take care of Idate!
 Isn’t it better to run…?
 Too late for that!
 I’ll cover you. Remove the ropes!
 Gotcha!
 Darn! I have to cut these!
 Darn it! I lost them all that time!
 Hey, lend me that thing!
 What?!
 Just hand it to me, hurry!
 Bastard, this is more important than my life.
 There’s no way I’ll let you use it…
 This is no time to be saying stuff like that!
 S-Stop you idiot!
 Hurry up, you loser!
 Heh, piece of cake!
 Sakura! They are just clones!
 Only the real one can attack you, so don’t worry!
 Sharingan!
 Sakura, Naruto!
 The real ones are hiding among the clones! Be careful!
 Sasuke! Guide us!
 Idate, stay close to me!
 Hah! I don’t want a Ninja’s help!
 Are you still saying that in this situation?!
 Naruto! Behind you!
 Naruto!
 A clone?!
 Oh, shoot!
 – Clone for clone! – Clone for clone!
 Damn, they got away.
 Nice work! Naruto!
 That Shadow Clone kid is troublesome.

 Rain?
 No! This is oil!

 Sasuke, no!

 Unlucky…
 Humph, not really.
 Fire attack?!
 B-Brother…
 Go! Having you stay will be a burden to me!
 B-Brother…
 Idate?
 N-Nothing!
 Sasuke, what can we do?!
 If the fire is this strong…
 We’ll have to dive in to the ocean!
 From here, we can swim to the port of Nagi Island!
 Right! There’s no other option left.
 Idate, can you swim?
 Y-Yeah…
 Hurry! I’ll cover you, so go first!
 This smoke should help you escape unnoticed!
 Idate?!
 There’s no way!
 Wha--?
 You are tricking me into becoming a decoy!
 What are you talking about?!
 You’re trying to get the enemy’s attention to me!
 That’s nonsense!
 No! I don’t trust Ninja!
 What are you doing? Go!
 Having you stay will be a burden to us!
 Go! Having you stay is a burden!
 Hurry up and go!
 There’s no way we will use you as a decoy!
 N-No…
 Cha!
 Idate! Duck down!
 Trust me Idate! I promise I’ll protect you!
 Watch out!
 Sa…!
 Sakura!
 S-Sakura…
 Go on ahead…
 We’ll follow you right after!
 A-All right…
 Well, shall we withdraw now?
 Withdraw?
 The most enjoyable part is still left undone.
 Darn, they are unexpectedly tenacious.
 Yeah. But we won’t let them get away.
 I-I should be okay here…
 Long time no see, Idate.
 Y-You are…
 I have taught you so many times not to trust anyone.
 Such a fool, you are…
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 Fool or whatever… lt doesn't matter now how you used to be.

 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 The Demon in the Snow
 Gatô, why did you come here?
 And who are those henchmen?
 Our strategy has changed a little…
 I'm sorry about this Zabuza,
 but you will die here.
 What?!
 Since hiring a regular Shinobi costs a lot of money,
 I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.
 And, it would have been even more ideal
 to save my money and effort if Ninja-to-Ninja battles
 ended in each killing the other off.
 Well, you are certainly not worthy of being called
 the Demon of the Hidden Mist Village.
 If you were to ask me, you're just a cute little demon!
 What are those guys?
 So many of them…
 Kakashi…I apologize.
 Our fight ends here...
 As long as my reason to take down Tazuna is gone,
 there is no reason to fight you either.
 Yeah... you are right.
 That reminds me...
 I owe him something.
 He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...
 Huh, he's dead.
 You bastard!
 What do you think you're doing, hey?!
 Stop! Don't act so recklessly…!
 You say something, too! He was your comrade, right?
 Shut up, punk. Haku is already dead.
 What…?
 Don't you feel anything watching him doing that!
 Weren't you with Haku for a long time!
 As Gatô used me… I was simply using Haku.
 I thought I'd told you…
 We Shinobi are merely tools.
 What I wanted were his skills and not Haku himself.
 I have no regrets...
 Do you... Do you really mean that?
 Naruto, stop.
 There's no need to fight him anymore...  Besides...
 Shut up! My enemy is still... this one!
 He...
 He really liked you!
 Is there someone special in your life?
 He liked you that much!
 When a person feels he wants to protect a person special to him,
 that person can truly become strong.
 Even so, don't you feel anything at all?!
 It's difficult for me to completely become a Shinobi.
 You really... honestly...
 don't feel anything at all?
 I'd like to make that person's dream come true...
 For that, I could completely become a Shinobi.
 When a person becomes as strong as you...
 Does that person really behave like you?
 He threw his life away for you!
 I'd like to make that person’s dream come true...
 That is my dream.
 He didn't even fulfill his own dreams and yet...
 I was happy.
 To die as a tool...!
 That's... That's... too painful...
 Kid...
 Don't say anything... anymore.
 Haku was...
 He wasn't just thinking of me.
 He was feeling pain inside for you
 while he battled you guys too...
 I know. 					He was too kind...
 I'm glad we could fight with you at the end.
 Huh?
 Yes, little punk, it's as you say, after all...
 Shinobi are human too...
 Maybe it's impossible to become an emotionless tool...
 I've lost.
 Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!
 Okay...
 What?!
 Enough! Take them down!
 Right!
 Are you crazy?
 Do you think you can win by yourself against this many of us?
 D-Demon!
 If you're so anxious to join your friend...
 you go ahead... alone!
 Unfortunately...
 I don't... intend on going... to the same place... as Haku!
 W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...
 You're going to hell with me!
 It's no big deal...
 When the Demon of the Hidden Mists Village
 dies and goes to hell, he can become a real demon.
 Look forward to it!
 I'll let you find out for sure
 if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!
 Haku...
 Now... it's goodbye, Haku...
 Thanks for everything...
 I'm sorry...
 Don't look away.
 It's the end for a man who lived fiercely.
 Yup...
 Did I... die...?
 Sasuke!
 Sakura...
 Am I... am I...?!
 Sakura, you're heavy.
 Huh?!
 Sasuke...
 Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!
 Sakura... 					That hurts...
 Things turned out well,  didn't they, Sakura?
 Stop, you shouldn't move...!
 Anyway, where's Naruto?
 And also, what happened to that mask guy?
 Naruto's fine.
 And... the masked kid, he died...
 Died? Did Naruto get him?
 Well... I'm not really sure, but he protected Zabuza...
 I had faith in you.
 You are awesome, Sasuke!
 You avoided getting inflicted with any mortal wounds!
 From the beginning... he intended to...
 Naruto!
 Sakura...
 Sasuke's all right! He's alive!
 Huh?
 He was feeling pain inside for you while he battled you guys too...
 He was too kind...
 I see... He...
 So, Sasuke's all right too...
 That's a relief...
 Hey, hey, hey!
 You guys are too relaxed!
 Darn Ninja...! Killing our source of money!
 Now that it's come to this,
 there's no choice but to attack the whole town and
 take everything valuable!
 Shoot, this isn't good!
 Kakashi Sensei!
 Don't you have a Jutsu to annihilate them all at once?
 That's impossible! I've used too much Chakra!
 Here we go!
 Enemies who come any closer to the island...
 With all the might of all the island's people...
 will not be allowed to live!
 Yeah!
 Inari!
 Heroes always arrive on the scene late!
 Inari... You guys...
 Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 I can do that even with my scarce Chakra...
 At least, it will bluff...
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kakashi Version!
 So... are you ready to fight?!
 No, we're not!
 We've done it!
 Sounds like it’s over.
 Yeah...
 Kakashi... I need to ask you a favor.
 What is it?
 His... I want to see his face...
 All right.
 Huh?
 Snow...
 Snow at this time of the year...?
 Haku... 					Are you crying?
 Thanks, Kakashi...
 You were always at my side...
 At the very least...
 I can be at your side in the end.
 If it's possible...
 I'd like to go...
 to the same place...
 as you.
 This guy...
 He was born in a village where it snowed a lot.
 I see...
 He was a boy as pure as snow...
 You'd be able to go, Zabuza.
 The two of you... together.
 But you know, Kakashi Sensei...
 Hmm?
 I wonder if the way a Ninja should be
 is really as these two were saying.
 Shinobi should not seek the reason for their own existence.
 What's important is to exist merely as tools.
 That's the same in the Land of Leaves.
 I wonder if that's what it really means
 to become a real Ninja.
 I guess... I guess...!
 I don't like that!
 Do you think so, too?
 Hmm...
 Well... That's why all Ninja live
 trying to figure that out without realizing...
 Like Zabuza... and that kid...
 Okay!
 Huh?
 I've just decided!
 I'm going to pursue my own Way of Ninja!
 I'm gonna sprint straight ahead and pursue
 a way that I absolutely won't regret!
 Thanks to you the bridge was safely completed,
 but we will miss you very much.
 Take care.
 Thank you for everything.
 Now, now!
 We'll come back for a visit again, Tazuna!
 For sure...?
 Huh?
 Inari... you're gonna miss us, aren't you?
 It's all right to cry. Go ahead and cry!
 I won't cry!
 It's all right if you cry, Naruto!
 Oh, is that so?
 See ya!
 Oh....!
 You are so stubborn.
 That boy changed Inari's mind...
 and Inari changed the minds of the village people.
 That boy created a bridge linking us to hope,
 a bridge called courage.
 So a linking bridge...
 Speaking of bridges,
 we need to name this bridge, don't we?
 That's true.
 In that case,
 I have a perfect name for this bridge.
 Yeah, what is it?
 The Naruto Great Bridge? How's that ?
 That's a good name.
 Okay! I'll get back soon and have Iruka Sensei treat me
 to ramen as the mission completion celebration!
 And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru tales of my heroic exploits!
 Then I...
 Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go on a date
 when we get back to the village?
 No, I don't think so.
 Just like that...?!
 You know! You know! I'll go with you!
 Be quiet!
 Shut up! Naruto!
 What? Are you sure that name's okay?
 This name is to wish that this bridge will never collapse...
 And someday, it'll be the name of a very famous bridge...
 A name heard around the world.
 That's truly what I hope.
 Hey, hey!
 Our Group Seven always has the easy missions lately.
 Meanwhile, there are plenty of powerful Ninja
 like Zabuza and Haku in other lands.
 Aren't there more exciting missions where I can be more active?
 Where I can use my Way of the Ninja and my soul like…you know?
 Next time: ""A New Chapter Begins: 		The Chunin Exam!""
 This is my Way of Ninja!

180,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Multiple Traps! Countdown to Destruction
 This many Paper Bombs… is a diversion?
 Y-Yes!
 No way…
 No. He’s a man who would go that far…
 After all, he is Genno the Trapper!
 Remember. Think. His actions thus far…
 His intent hidden in there.
 First he steals the blueprints for key facilities in the village
 and pretends to blow himself up in front of the Anbu Black Ops.
 Because of the incident,
 an S-Level Emergency Security Alert is given…
 The village becomes poorly manned…
 and Genno is able to move around as he pleases…
 Then why did he scatter the blueprints he stole?
 With this incident, it becomes evident that Genno might still be alive
 so the guys on watch outside end up returning
 to the village as quickly possible…
 Could that have been his objective?
 He directed everyone’s attention to the Paper Bombs
 and reassembled the village Shinobi.
 If his aim is to set up something there…
 Could it be…?
 The Paper Bombs in the village were a decoy?
 You can’t see the Paper Bombs in this room?
 What’s this?!
 What’s up with these Paper Bombs?
 Do you know the geological conditions
 of the Great Stone Faces?
 G-Geological conditions…?
 To be precise, the geological condition of this plateau
 which the Great Stone Faces are carved into.
 The plateau towering behind the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 is made of extremely hard rock.
 But this rock has narrow lines running through it, you see…
 It can be easily broken if power is applied along those lines.
 The Great Stone Faces were created using this…
 This time and thirty years ago
 aren’t the only times I’ve come to the Leaf…
 I’ve visited the Leaf several times and checked things out…
 And then I finally determined it…
 I determined how to set Paper Bombs to destroy this plateau!
 Wha--?!
 I’m fairly certain no one would imagine
 the destruction of the Great Stone Faces…
 Especially when
 we’re in the middle of Paper Bomb removal operations.
 We wouldn't even think about the Great Stone Faces…
 But if that entire plateau were to slide down and crumble…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 would be completely buried in earth and sand!
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 It would be destroyed!
 Choji, contact the Fifth Hokage immediately!
 Make sure the guys who return don’t enter the village…
 Shikamaru, be happy!
 Guy Sensei and the others have come back!
 Hurry, hurry! Now that Might Guy has returned,
 we won’t let the enemy do as he pleases!
 Too late, huh…?
 What’s the matter…?
 Shikamaru!
 Naruto has…!
 Why…? Why destroy the whole village…?
 If you do that, many innocent people will die.
 And all the buildings you built will be destroyed.
 Is that what you want?!
 You may think revenge is your last job or whatever,
 but something like this is absolutely mistaken.
 If you’re going to go through with this no matter what…
 I’ll stop you!
 That’s impossible.
 No way will I let you detonate the Paper Bombs!
 Nope. I won from the moment you set foot in here.
 Even if you defeat me,
 the triggering device will activate the instant you leave this place.
 It seems everyone has returned…
 I guess I’ll be activating the triggring device…
 The Village Hidden in the Leaves shall meet
 the same fate as Heat Devil Village!
 I won’t let that happen!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 It’s over!
 It’s useless to resist…
 It’s impossible for you alone to disarm all of my traps.
 No doubt, it might be impossible for me alone…
 but I’ve got friends!
 But didn’t you do nothing but badmouth them at Ichiraku?
 Yeah. I get in fights with them a lot and they tick me off sometimes…
 But they’re my friends!
 They’re Shinobi who will protect the Leaf with me!
 No matter what traps you set…
 they’ll manage somehow, no matter what!
 Then, I’ll finish everything before that.
 You won't be able to stop them this time!
 Fang Over Fang…!
 I’d say that was a close shave, huh?
 Kiba! Akamaru! How’d you know I was here…?
 Thank Hinata!
 She thought it was strange that you’d leave for no reason,
 so she frantically searched for you with her Byakugan.
 But the Byakugan shouldn’t be that versatile…
 I'm surprised you found us…
 Well, we had a pretty good idea of where you were…
 Shikamaru said that the final trap would be in the Great Stone Faces.
 Shikamaru did…?
 I see…
 This means I shouldn’t take young opponents lightly, huh…?
 Right. You misjudged our power…
 Th-These are…insects?!
 That’s right… You’re finished now.
 Get down, you two!
 Old man…
 He blew himself up!
 No, that’s not it!
 It’s a Substitution…
 It seems he switched just before being covered with the insects…
 It’s over now…
 Wh-What’s this…?
 It’s the Shadow Strangle Jutsu…
 You anticipated my actions…?
 Yup. Checkmate, old man. Come on right over here…
 Choji, restrain him.
 Got it…
 Oh, shoot! His shadow…!
 Shikamaru… What did he do…?
 He had set it so a smoke screen would activate
 if he were touched by an enemy.
 Choji, to the right!
 Human Boulder!
 The Leaf is now finished!
 A strike?
 Why won't… the Paper Bomb explode?
 Tough luck…
 We already disarmed that Paper Bomb.
 And we disarmed all the triggering devices
 set inside the Great Stone Faces.
 This is as far as you go old man…
 That’s right… Prepare yourself!
 It’s useless to run!
 I don’t know how incredible of a Trapper you are.
 But my friends’ teamwork is better than you are!
 I must not give up here…
 Give up, already!
 No matter what you set up, we’ll stop it!
 I wouldn’t be able… to show my face to my son…
 Where’d he…?
 Over there!
 It seems you haven’t disarmed all of the triggering devices…
 I…win!
 The village!
 Don’t be fooled, guys! This is a Genjutsu!
 Release!
 Naruto!
 Huh? Wh-What?
 Summoning Jutsu!
 He's planning to get on that bird and escape!
 Leave it to me!
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 All right! It’s a success…
 – Ino…! 					– Hey!
 Why’d you break the Jutsu?!
 What’s the matter?
 His body… It really hurt…
 He’s fighting while enduring a lot of pain in his body!
 I won’t let you escape!
 Naruto…
 Sure enough…
 I’m no match for a young person at Taijutsu, huh…?
 It’s not like that…
 You’re a quite the practitioner of Taijutsu…
 Now it’s finally over!
 It’s not over yet…
 What?
 What do you mean… it’s not over yet?
 Where’s the bird he summoned earlier?
 Oh! Over there!
 There are Paper Bombs on its feet!
 What?!
 The Mountainside Image of the Third Hokage is the spot
 where I restored a crack…
 I used a device different from the others…
 That cracked section is slightly more fragile than the other areas…
 I set an triggering device that takes advantage of that…
 If there an explosion occurs there,
 the other Paper Bombs will explode at once.
 Going so far as to set a device in such a place…
 To think we overlooked that…!
 That means he summoned that bird to activate the device?!
 At last…my wish will come true…
 Here it comes!
 I'll use this…
 It dodged them!
 We can’t bring it down with a long-range attack?!
 I’ll defend the Leaf, no matter what!
 I’ll blow him away with the Rasengan before he slams into this place!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 What?!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu! Both arms!
 Naruto, use my hands!
 Thanks, Choji!
 H-Hinata?!
 U-Umm…Shikamaru told me to read that bird’s movements
 with my Byakugan and to give you directions…
 Huh…?
 I leave the rest to you!
 All right, let’s go, Hinata!
 R-Right!
 Byakugan!
 Not yet… Draw it closer…
 It’ll be okay.
 No matter what,
 I’ll protect the village the Third Hokage risked his life to protect!
 Naruto… Now!
 Rasengan!
 It vanished?!
 Up above!
 Damn it. Reach!
 You little!
 What? Did something happen…?
 All right!
 Yes! We did it, Hinata!
 N-Naruto…
 The inside of his body is in terrible shape…
 It’s amazing that he lived until today.
 Old man…
 It’s too bad… I failed to leave my name in history…
 But…I had…fun…
 What?
 What do you mean, old man?!
 What do you mean you had fun?!
 Old Man Genno!
 Naruto? 					No, it’s not…
 “My son proud as a peacock having beaten me at treasure hunting…”
 Treasure hunting…?
 Did you notice…?
 Huh?
 The Leaf didn't suffer a single casualty in this incident…
 Old Man Genno! Open your eyes!
 Old Man Genno!!
 I figured it out, Shikamaru…
 It seems the person in this picture is Genno’s real son…
 Son…?
 It seems he became a Shinobi like his father…
 but lost his life right after that when the Leaf invaded Heat Devil Village.
 I bet he wanted to avenge his own son…
 So he did something like this…
 No doubt, at first he may have infiltrated the village for revenge…
 At first…?
 Something was kind of bugging me,
 so I checked out the triggering device that was set in the Academy
 one more time.
 There was a loose connection in one spot.
 It was set up so it wouldn’t activate even if the target were hit…
 Wasn’t that just Genno’s mistake…?
 Genno was a first-rate Trapper.
 It’s unlikely he’d make such a simple mistake…
 No doubt about it…
 The same goes for the traps in the Great Stone Faces…
 There were some defective bombs mixed in with the Paper Bombs.
 Even if the traps were activated,
 there's a strong possibility that
 they'd only make a few cracks in the Great Stone Faces.
 Then he had no serious intention of smashing the Leaf?
 Then…for what purpose…?
 Treasure hunting…
 What do you mean treasure hunting?
 It makes more sense to think of it like that.
 In other words, he infiltrated the village for the sake of revenge,
 but he changed his mind after meeting Naruto
 who was a spitting image of his son…
 He probably knew that he didn’t have long to live.
 If he was going to do something before dying,
 he wanted it to be the thing he found most fun…
 He probably wanted to re-enact his treasure-hunts with his son…
 using the traps he set to smash the Leaf.
 So that’s what it was.
 Well, it’s just conjecture, though.
 So that old man… wasn’t a bad person…
 I told you from the start.
 Those who like Ichiraku's ramen can't be bad people!
 What? But in actuality, didn’t he hate ramen?
 Ichiraku ramen is different!
 There’s no way you can keep eating something you hate every day.
 Exactly!
 Old man…
 Naruto…?
 The enemies who come to the Leaf won’t always be like this.
 Someone like Orochimaru might attack again!
 That means we must always be prepared!
 Right!
 It’s a pain, though…
 I’ll eat in preparation for that!
 We’ll protect the Leaf Village!
 With all of us working together…
 On a checkerboard night
 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 Thank you all for your support!

 We've even called on someone who hasn't been in the show recently

181,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!
 Wh-What is that Jutsu?!
 Damn it!
 Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Don’t flatter yourself!
 Stop it!
 Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds
 It’s a tranquil village as always…
 The security sucks.
 Humph!
 We should just massacre everybody in such a seedy village.
 Calm down, Sakon.
 We haven’t come here to fight.
 Shut up, you chicken.
 If you’re scared,
 you should just go home and go to bed already.
 I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya.
 You understand what our job is this time, right?
 Let’s go. We escort our special guest.
 Stop it!
 Damn.
 I can’t stop completely.
 Kakashi Sensei?
 Naruto… That thing you just did was…
 What’re you guys doing up on top of the hospital?
 You went a bit too far for just a fight, you two.
 That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.
 It’s the Rasengan.
 What’s going on?
 How can Naruto use that Jutsu…?
 Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?
 What’re you doing giving yourself over to a sense of superiority?
 The size of the Chidori there wasn’t one to be aimed
 at a comrade of the same village.
 Why such infantile behavior…?
 Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi…
 Sasuke.
 Damn it!
 Naruto…
 How far will you go…?
 Kakashi Sensei…
 Whatever happened to teamwork?
 Was it you… who taught him that technique?
 I think Naruto is still too young to be handling that Jutsu.
 He could’ve killed Sasuke had something gone wrong…
 Even if it’s a means of resisting the Akatsuki,
 to think you would teach Naruto that Jutsu…
 Right back at you…
 That Chidori was also considerably hairy.
 But I didn’t think he was the kind of kid
 who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade.
 Or is it that there’s something quite complicated between him and that kid?
 Well, all sorts.
 All sorts?
 Quite simply, it’s a relationship
 like the one between you and Orochimaru in the past.
 I see.
 To him, Sasuke is a comrade and a rival at the same time…
 Well, someone he considers an equal.
 Most likely, he couldn’t take Sasuke’s cheap provocation.
 He’s been chasing him…
 Chasing him since the Academy days.
 Are you hurt…
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Sasuke!
 I won’t lose to you!
 For him, it’s neither you nor me now…
 More than anyone…
 he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.
 On the other side of the coin…
 Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growth at close range and feels inferior.
 To the extent that he thinks he himself isn’t growing at all.
 Scaredy-Cat?
 Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Naruto has gotten strong…
 And Sasuke…
 I’m going to kill a certain man, no matter what.
 Revenge, huh…?
 I wonder if Itachi is frustrating that kid.
 So Sasuke doesn’t want to acknowledge Naruto.
 If he acknowledges him,
 he just might deny himself up to this point…
 Rivalry is a difficult thing.
 It’s not a very good trend…
 Maybe I’ll do some scolding.
 Then I leave Naruto to you.
 Well, I have a mission. And there’s the Chidori thing, too…
 Sakura.
 It’s okay. Things can go back to the way they were in the old days again.
 Cheer up.
 See ya.
 Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.
 Naruto…
 Sakura.
 Don’t interfere with us!
 You are weak.
 Why are you weak?
 It's because you don’t have enough…
 …hate.
 What’ve I been doing…
 up until now?
 He got a nice look in those eyes.
 Shall we go soon?
 What do you think you’re doing?
 If I don’t do this, you’ll run away, right?
 You’re not the type to listen quietly to lectures.
 As I recall, that’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja.
 Sasuke… Forget about something like revenge.
 What?
 Well, in this business I’ve seen a stink of guys like you.
 But the final days of those who speak of revenge are never good.
 They’re tragic.
 You’ll only hurt yourself and agonize more than now.
 Even if you succeed in revenge, all that will remain is emptiness.
 Shut up!
 What do you know?
 Don’t talk to me as if you know!
 Well, calm down…
 If you like,
 shall I go and kill the person most important to you?
 You’ll be able to realize just how far off you are
 on what you just said.
 Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that.
 Unfortunately, I don’t even have one person like that.
 Everyone’s already been killed.
 I’ve lived longer than you have…
 The times were not good.
 I know all too well the agony of losing something.
 Well, both you and I aren’t the lucky ones…
 That’s for darned sure.
 But we’re not the worst, either.
 You and I,
 we both have already found dear comrades, haven’t we?
 It’s because I have lost that I understand.
 The Chidori is a power…
 I gave to you because you now have something important.
 You should know that it’s not a power
 to be used on your comrade or to use for revenge,
 and I’m sure you know what it should be used for.
 Think hard about whether or not what I’m saying is wrong.
 It’ll be tricky with a Shinobi of that level hanging around.
 So let’s wait a bit.
 Maybe jerks like you’d be no good. But I could do it.
 I wonder. “Two” should be ample to rip him apart.
 Don’t be butting in all the time, you clod.
 Tayuya, women shouldn’t use words like that too…
 Shut up, fatso.
 – More, please! – More, please!
 Wanna head back?
 Sure!
 We both made it to the top of the tree.
 Sakura.
 I have a something to talk to you about.
 I’ll go out on a date with you, so come along.
 Damn it…
 Damn it!
 The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru during the Chunin Exam…
 Kakashi Sensei said it was okay now, but…
 Master Orochimaru.
 You didn’t need to send out all four members, did you?
 It seems those kids are all interested in Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.
 To see what extent his power is…
 A contest of strength or whatever,
 at this point Sasuke would be no match for them.
 That is precisely why…he will come to me in search of power.
 Who’re you guys?
 I’m Kidomaru, the East Gate of the Sound Ninja Four.
 I’m Sakon, the West Gate of the same.
 I’m Jirobo, the South Gate of the same.
 I’m Tayuya, the North Gate of the same.
 I’m in a bad mood now…
 If you wanna continue to fight her,
 I won’t go easy on you!
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying

 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

 What do you want to eat, Sakura?
 Anything's fine.
 At any rate, Kakashi Sensei's over the top.
 I just wanted to fight Sasuke a little.
 But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it, right about now…
 Of course, which of us was stronger would be settled, believe it.
 Listen, Naruto…

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.

 and seal your power.
 Huh?
 Huh?!
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Why?!
 S-Sakura. Umm, where am I?!
 As for me, what am I doing lying here?!
 Oh yeah! Kurenai Sensei got stabbed
 and my heart leapt out of my chest and…
 No, that’s not it. Where’s that girl?
 Where’s Yakumo?
 It seems you don’t remember at all.
 You got caught breaking into a mountain cottage
 under special security!
 Huh…?!
 The Anbu Black Ops are in action,
 so you should be thankful you’re alive!
 Oh yeah!
 The dream I just had… lt was strangely real.
 No doubt it was the girl in the mountain cottage!
 What’re you blabbing about?!
 I’ll inject you with a stimulant if you don’t knock it off.
 I can’t be doing stuff like this!
 Hold it!
 The medicine hasn’t worn off, yet!
 Sensei! Kurenai Sensei!
 Kurenai’s already gone out.
 What?!
 You’ve gone to the trouble of getting up early.
 So how about joining me for an early-morning marathon?
 This isn’t the time for that!
 Morning marathons are great!
 Marathons purge the sweat and impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleep.
 More importantly, where did Kurenai Sensei go?!
 Come to think of it,
 she said something about going to visit someone…
 Something about a student
 she took care of in the past being in poor health…
 Huh? She went to see Yakumo!
 Then at least join me for some morning exercise!
 Morning exercise purges the sweat and impurities built up
 in your body from a night of sleep…
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Whoa?!
 I have something I want to ask you, Kurenai Sensei.
 Naruto, don’t stick your nose into my business any further.
 Yesterday I went to see Yakumo!
 I don’t know if it was on account of that,
 but I just had a strangely real dream!
 A dream…?
 Yeah.
 You said to Yakumo that you were going to use a Sealing Jutsu
 if she wouldn’t give up becoming a Ninja…
 Sorry, but I’m in a hurry…
 H-Hey. Wait!
 It doesn’t concern you…
 Yes, it does!
 Hinata, Kiba and Shino are all troubled
 because you said you were going to quit!
 Doesn’t the fact that you’re quitting Squad Eight
 have something to do with that girl Yakumo?!
 What you saw wasn’t just a dream…
 What…?!
 I used a Sealing Jutsu and took away a student’s power!
 No way. That couldn’t be!
 It happened over a year ago…
 By my own hand, I crushed the dream of a girl…
 I tutored individually named Yakumo…
 who was trying to become a practitioner of Genjutsu.
 No way!
 I don’t deserve to have the lives of the Genin
 in Squad Eight entrusted to me.
 But why…?
 Now, get out of my way!
 That’s the end of this conversation.
 No way… But I still have stuff I want to ask you…!
 I have no choice.
 What's happening?!
 They won’t come off!
 Kurenai Sensei, that’s just cruel!
 We’re already surrounded…
 Make emergency contact with the village…
 Yes, sir.
 There!
 What?!
 We’re counting on you!
 What?!
 Hurry…to the Hokage!
 Yakumo… Come with us.
 Geez, that Naruto.
 The least he could do is thank me for attending to him all night.
 What?!
 Isn’t it about tea time?
 After you’ve taken care of these documents!
 Why’s there so much work?
 It’s because you didn’t take care of it lickety-split, Lady Tsunade.
 It’s a carrier pigeon for emergency contacts!
 What?!
 It’s from the mountain cottage in Satomi Hill…
 Something’s happened to Yakumo!
 There’s a possibility that a person being protected
 by the Village Hidden in Leaves, Yakumo Kurama, has been kidnapped.
 Head for the mountain cottage in Satomi Hill and secure Yakumo.
 Yakumo Kurama…
 As I recall, that’s the girl Kurenai took custody of, right?
 Yes, the only daughter of Murakumo of the Kurama Clan head family.
 Umm, what’s the Kurama Clan?
 It’s natural that you guys wouldn’t know.
 They were a distinguished family
 that wielded considerable power in the village,
 but they’re just a shadow of what they used to be.
 The death of Murakumo and his wife about a year ago
 became the catalyst for that.
 I hear that the clan fell apart after that.
 Does the kidnapping of the only daughter of the head family mean
 that the Kurama Clan’s Secret Jutsu is being targeted?
 Well…
 According to the documents
 handed down from the Third Hokage,
 it seems her latent powers as a Genjutsu Ninja
 are extremely dangerous…
 In other words, she would make for a powerful asset
 if those powers can be awakened.
 That means it wouldn’t be surprising
 if there were guys seeking that power, huh?
 After her parents died,
 she was kept under protective custody in the village.
 All right. Leave it to me!
 I won’t allow a girl to cry!
 Might Guy, the Leaf Village's Handsome Devil
 will rescue her, no matter what!
 Sakura, you go with them as well.
 – What?! 					– Huh?
 Once we have her in custody,
 we’ll need someone to look after her condition.
 Only one with experience as a Medical Ninja can do this.
 Y-Yes ma’am!
 This mission is a chance to show my master
 the fruits of my training!
 Ouch!
 Ouch? Did you trip on a tree root or something?
 What’s this?!
 N-Naruto…!
 He fell asleep in a place like this?!
 Nice, Akamaru!
 Naruto…
 He’s…caught in a Genjutsu!
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Release!
 What…? Sakura…
 Salty!
 What the hell is this?! I mean, was I asleep again?
 What’re you babbling about?!
 You were caught in a Genjutsu.
 Genjutsu…
 I was chasing after Kurenai Sensei
 who was heading for the Satomi mountain cottage
 and I tried to get her to listen to me.
 Satomi mountain cottage, you say?
 Then Kurenai went alone?
 Yeah, probably.
 Kurenai’s in danger
 if she went without being aware what’s happening!
 Huh?
 Something’s strange…
 Someone’s here!
 Damn it. Was it a mistake to come alone…?
 But I don’t have the time to return to the village…
 They’re most likely after…Yakumo.
 What?!
 Oh no!
 Sorry, but I mustn’t allow you to interfere with our work.
 Wha--?!
 You think you caught me with that?
 What?!
 You’re the one who’s caught!
 The enemies are also practitioners of Genjutsu.
 I must not lose…
 What’s this presence?!
 They’re both caught in a Genjutsu.
 Yakumo… Is that you, Yakumo?
 So you were safe!
 Help me!
 It’s okay now, Yakumo.
 I’ll protect you, no matter what.
 Kurenai Sensei!
 Release!
 You were hit with a reverse Genjutsu, eh?
 I-I’m sorry.
 Just what I’d expect from a Jonin…
 No, I should probably say Kurenai Yuhi…
 Stay alert!
 We should consider ourselves
 as being under suspicion by the Leaf Village.
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 The two who took Yakumo haven’t returned…
 I guess somewhat violent action can’t be avoided.
 Although we come from the same village…
 we will get Yakumo, no matter what the cost.
 Understood?
 – Yes, sir! 					– Yes, sir!
 Oh!
 What is it, Hinata?!
 Did you see something?
 The mountain cottage is being attacked by someone.
 There are four out front and four inside the mountain cottage.
 Are two of the people inside the mountain cottage
 Kurenai and Yakumo?
 I bet that’s it!
 Kurenai Sensei, what the hell happened?!
 Tell us!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 I’m surprised…
 Who would’ve thought that
 the intruders would turn out to be you people.
 But whatever reasons you may have, I won’t let you take Yakumo!
 The Third Hokage entrusted this child to me.
 Even if you are experts in Genjutsu,
 I will protect this child with every ounce of strength I have in my body.

 So what’s up, Temari?
 He’s close. He’s just right there.
 Dang it! What should we do?
 Leave it to me.
 That was close.
 What was that noise?
 An explosion… Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.
 I wonder if he’s okay.
 Don’t worry… He wouldn’t get bumped off so easily.
 I sure hope so.
 Now then, shall we get started?
 Before that, I must have you both return to your original forms.
 Please prepare yourself, Sarutobi Sensei.
 An Unrivaled Match: Hokage Battle Royale!
 With every moment, they are looking more lively…
 What is that…Jutsu?
 Reanimation.
 It’s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu that can bring the dead back to this world.
 The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu is that it uses the blood of the caster.
 But I’ve heard that with this Jutsu,
 in order to summon a dead soul to this world…
 the body of a living person is sacrificed as a container for the soul.
 Then, the bodies of those two are of the sacrificed…
 Right…
 Perhaps dust and dirt cover the sacrificial body
 and take on the original form of the summoned soul.
 And by way of the charm embedded in the head,
 the personality of the soul is killed
 and it morphs into no more than a killing puppet.
 They’re complete.
 They look like how they used to look more than ever.
 Do you know the joy and sense of accomplishment
 of hurting one whom you once called Sensei?
 I prepared this scenario so that you might know that joy.
 So please enjoy it.
 Lord Hokage!
 Even if the shape and form are the same…
 they’re neither the First Hokage nor the Second!
 I…know!
 Here I go!
 Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.
 Water Style: Water Wall.
 No way!
 To be able to set into motion that level of Water Style in a place with no water.
 I can’t believe it.
 True to the title of the previous Hokage.
 Water Style: Water Shock Wave!
 Earth Style: Mud Wall.
 Same mighty strength as always.
 Having two of you is quite a challenge, as might be expected…
 This is bad.
 This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.
 Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:
 Deep Forest Emergence.
 His Chakra became a source for life.
 Wow… So this is the legendary Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage
 who brought turbulent times under control and built the Leaf Village.
 You’re finally caught…eh, Sensei.
 Okay. Everyone’s here, right?
 Okay everyone, let’s evacuate quickly.
 Don’t rush and don’t panic!
 What’s the matter, Konohamaru?
 Does your stomach hurt or something?
 No…it’s not that.

 I’m going to do it now!
 It’s too late.
 Please…Enma! The Adamantine Nyoi.
 Take care of him. Don’t let him transform into that!
 Okay… Got it!
 Transform!
 All right.
 Wow… What level of Ninjutsu battle!
 This is Hokage level!
 Oh well… Things have finally gotten interesting.
 That's one of his Snake Swords.
 Let’s do it, Enma!
 No matter how strong the body, the Snake Sword still hurts.
 You’re mine!
 Lord Hokage!
 So foolish…
 To think you’d strike without even using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
 No, that’s not it.
 It's not that he didn't use it. He can’t use it.
 The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage has differs from the past.
 The Shadow Clone Jutsu that evenly disperses Chakra,
 if things go wrong, would be like throwing away Chakra.
 Sure enough, is it age?!
 Are you okay, Sensei?
 Please hang in there.
 You are called…
 “the Professor who knows and uses all of the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village,” right?
 Please don’t disappoint me too much.
 Please get up, Lord Hokage…!
 And please save the Leaf Village!

 You’re not your usual self.

 Now’s the time to draw the line.
 Orochimaru…
 You…fool!
 Orochimaru…
 This is the end.
 I’ll snap your neck.
 As I thought…
 It looks like there’s no point if I don’t do something about the soul itself
 that is bound by the Reanimation.
 If so, all I can do is to use… the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.
 Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage, please forgive me for using that Jutsu!
 Sensei…it seems you’re out of breath.
 You’ve gotten old, haven’t you?
 I’ve never seen such a pained look.
 What’s so funny?
 It’s quite sad…
 Old age beats even you, once renowned as the god of Shinobi.
 What’s that…?! What the heck is going on?
 Who the heck is that youth?
 Who the heck are you?!
 Is it so sudden you can’t tell?
 It’s me. Orochimaru.

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.

 Those tears will change your fate.

 We should seek lodging for the night before we get rained on.
 I see. Carry on.
 Yes, Milady.
 What dense fog?!
 We cannot see what’s up ahead.
 What was that?
 Is something the matter?
 Lady Kayo!
 The Mysterious Curse of the Haunted House
 I hear that it happened while the mistress of the Land of Honey, Lady Kayo,
 was on her way to visit the household of her parents in Land of Candy.
 Attendants from Land of Candy went out to meet them,
 thinking it odd that their arrival was delayed,
 only to find that the palanquin and poles had been cast away at the mountain pass.
 I am told that Lady Kayo and all of her attendants have disappeared.
 Then, our task is to search for the Lady, right?
 That is so.
 Hinata’s Byakugan and Kiba and Akamaru’s keen sense of smell
 should prove helpful in this search mission,
 and Naruto is, well, just Naruto.
 What are you saying, Grandma?
 That I have nothing in particular to recommend me?
 But isn’t that the case?
 I think that you have good points, too, Naruto…
 Oh! Leave it to Hinata.
 Go ahead and list them up for Grandma Tsunade!
 Come on, what are my good points?
 Er…umm… 					Let me see…
 It shouldn’t be that hard!
 I didn’t mean to make it seem that way… Um…well…
 Hey there, you two. Are you done?
 Say, Grandma, there wouldn’t be anything odd
 happening in this mission, would there?
 Something odd?
 That is to say…might there perhaps… be ghosts involved?
 Ghosts? Are you afraid of such things?
 Well, umm, er…kinda.
 There are no such things as ghosts.
 Stop talking such nonsense and get on your way.
 Which brings us to the question of where to, Fifth Hokage?
 Kubisaki Pass.
 K-Kubisaki Pass? As in the Broken Neck Pass?
 I knew I had a bad premonition.
 Fool!
 A Shinobi shouldn't dally about such things. Get to business!
 You’re scarier than any ghost!
 We’re off!
 Excuse us.
 It’s always like this with that one…
 Lady Tsunade, Kubisaki Pass is where
 the capital of the Land of Necks once stood isn't it?
 The ruined castle of the Kubisaki Clan,
 which met its destruction 50 years ago, must still be there.
 And what of it?
 Ruined castles may be found just about anywhere.
 Have you caught Naruto’s cowardice bug, Shizune?
 N-No, that’s not it.
 Oh, this is the spot.
 The Broken Neck Pass.
 It gives me the creeps somehow, I tell you.
 It's started to rain. Let’s hurry.
 It’s really coming down!
 A castle.
 I hadn’t heard anything about a castle standing here.
 Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this.
 See, see?! This mission is starting to seem creepier and creepier.
 But this may be a major clue.
 Let’s go.
 Yeah. At this rate, we’ll get soaking wet.
 H-Hey, don’t be in such a hurry!
 What a magnificent castle.
 Won’t it be sort of rude to suddenly intrude upon them?
 It’s almost night. Maybe we’ll be causing them trouble.
 Naruto, don’t tell me you really are scared!
 N-No way, I tell you!
 Pull yourself together, Naruto.
 Let’s go.
 The door opened by itself!
 Excuse me, is anybody home?
 The lights are turned on.
 Please let us shelter here from the rain for a bit!
 Hey! Wait! Akamaru!
 Excuse us!
 Good evening.
 Something sure smells good.
 It’s still warm.
 Was someone here until just a little while ago?
 What’s that?
 That’s one scary looking guy.
 I wonder if he’s the master of this castle.
 If he’s the master of this castle, than that makes him a feudal lord right?
 If this is the feudal lord’s castle,
 then the area around here should be the capital.
 But this is right on the country borderline.
 Hey! Akamaru!
 What are you doing?
 You shouldn’t eat that without permission.
 – Naruto? 					– What is it?
 Don’t startle me like that.
 Just now, the painting’s eyes moved!
 You moron. How could a painting move? You’re too much of a scaredy-cat.
 The table’s set for seven people.
 So, what of it?
 The Land of Honey party that went missing also numbered seven.
 The Lady and her attendants may still be in this castle…
 Let’s split up and search for them.
 Wha…? 					We gonna split up?
 Since we’re all here together, why don’t we search together?
 What do you say, Kiba? Hinata?
 Naruto, stop talking like a kid. This is a mission!
 You don’t have to scold me so much! I know that!
 Hey! Wait a minute!
 I’m just not cut out for this kind of stuff.
 This is scarier than going to the bathroom in the middle of the night!
 This is creepy!
 No!
 Not again!
 Kiba, Hinata, Akamaru!
 I’m too scared alone, after all!
 Do you sense it, too? I’m sure this is the scent of a human being.
 It’s here.
 There’s no one here.
 I’ll eat you up.
 Who’s that? ls someone there?
 The ceiling…
 Take that, you.
 Look at all these books!
 The History of Neck Castle…
 This was written a full fifty years ago!
 ""The enemy forces have already surrounded the castle.
 ""Our people were brutally slaughtered and
 ""there’re only few of the soldiers left in castle.
 ""It seems certain that I would not live to see nightfall either.
 ""But my thirst for vengeance remains in the castle,
 ""and I vow with this castle to consume every last man,
 ""every human setting foot within these walls…
 ""Signed, Gosa Kubisaki.""
 Consume?
 I’ll eat you…

 Hinata! Pull yourself together!

 Naruto, Hinata, are you all right?
 Kiba, Akamaru!
 A castle that fell fifty years ago?
 What nonsense!
 That is how the scroll is dated.
 It says that everyone who enters this castle will be eaten alive.
 True, we have been swallowed whole!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay? Hey!
 That hurt!
 There he is!
 I-I’m sorry!
 What is this?
 This isn’t the armor of the Kubisaki Clan.
 I wonder if this belonged to an enemy soldier…
 There’s some more over there. They are different armors.
 Those armors bear the crest of the Kubisaki Clan.
 Let’s hurry up and get out of here!
 That’s the same armor as in the painting!
 Could it be… that this is the real Gosa Kubisaki?
 Gosa Kubisaki?
 What’s going on?
 He’s melting!
 What is this?
 Something smells really sour.
 There is something strange about this castle.
 Hinata!
 Yeah.
 Byakugan!
 The whole wall is covered with a flow of Chakra.
 Why?
 It’s moving!
 This wall seems to be alive!
 What if…
 Gentle Fist!
 A-Are you all right, Hinata?
 Uh-huh.
 I’ve seen something very similar to this somewhere before.
 The giant toad summoned by the Pervy Sage…
 from inside its stomach!
 Inside its stomach?!
 Then, I wonder if, by chance, this smell could be…gastric juices?!
 Gosa Kubisaki invoked the Summoning Jutsu
 before the fall of the castle.
 But the thing he summoned…
 was big enough to swallow the entire castle whole.
 From the time we entered the castle, we, too, have been gobbled up!
 But, why would this thing go to the trouble of transforming to a castle to eat us?
 I don’t know.
 What was that?
 Oh!
 H-Help!
 Are you the Lady of the Land of Honey?
 She’s embedded in the wall.
 We are from the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 We have come to help you.
 Here, I’ll help you out now.
 It’s no use.
 Please hang on!
 Oh no! This thing is rounding up all the humans inside here
 and returning to its original form.
 At this rate, we're in danger too!
 Naruto, Hinata, we’ve got to get out of here!
 Man Beast Clone!
 Fang over Fang!
 I am the castle.
 and by order of my master Gosa, I am to eat all who set foot within.
 Naruto!
 Ouch…
 I’ll eat you.
 How can we get out of its stomach?!
 I don’t know.
 If this creature was Summoned,
 then there should be a scroll for the contract.
 If we tear up the scroll, then this creature should return to the world it came from.
 Is that so?
 – Hinata! 					– Right!
 Byakugan!
 Found it.
 It’s up above. Probably in the castle tower.
 How are we supposed to get up there in this situation?!
 The wall’s Chakra have begun to stabilize again.
 Who's that?
 Gosa Kubisaki!
 I won’t be fooled again.
 That, too, is just a phantom created by the Summoning.
 Wait!
 He looks different from the one before.
 Wh-What’s he doing?
 He seems to want us to follow him.
 Huh? He disappeared!
 Naruto, over there.
 Oh, it’s the scroll!
 It's starting to act up again. Hurry, Naruto!
 Right!
 This is…
 It’s the true form of the Summoned animal.
 The concentration of acid is increasing.
 Hey, let’s hurry and wind things up!
 Wait a minute.
 What if, when this summoned animal goes back to where it came from,
 it takes us with it, too?
 We’ll just have to take our chances. We gotta do this!
 Right.
 Did that do it?
 What the--?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Over there, Naruto.
 It should be possible to tear the wall at that spot.
 Okay! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Naruto!
 The lord of this castle must have died
 resenting the people who seized the castle from him.
 But, he also led us to where the scroll was hidden…
 Then, does that mean that he decided to let go of his grudge?
 Surely that must be the case.
 What’s more, he must have felt sorry for
 the Summoned animal that nobly served him for fifty years,
 and wanted to release it.
 I see.
 Then maybe he was waiting for someone
 to release the Summoned animal from its spell.
 And now, it has finally been able to return to its own world.

 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Ugh... what are you here for now?
 It’s our reunion after so long, and you’re awfully cold.
 Don’t tell me that you came to assassinate Lord Hokage?
 No, no…
 I don’t have enough subordinates for that yet...
 I’ve heard of the excellence ones of this village
 and thought I’d put dibs on them.
 A little while ago, I gave that same Curse Mark as a present.
 There’s a kid that I want.
 Selfish as always.
 That kid will die.
 Certainly…
 The odds are 1 in 10 that he’ll survive,
 but he may survive just like you did.
 This kid, you really like him, huh?
 Are you jealous?
 Are you still holding a grudge that I used you and threw you away?
 Unlike you, that kid will excel...
 For one thing, he inherited the Uchiha ability.
 He has beautiful features
 and is a vessel who can become my heir.
 If that kid lived, it makes things interesting.
 Be sure not to cancel this test.
 Three from my village are also under your care…
 Make me enjoy it.
 If something happens to deprive me of my fun,
 consider it the end of Leaf Village.
 We’ve secured food and water after spending half a day.
 And now most teams have halted activity.
 As we planned, this is the time that we attack.
 We'll split up into three and go scouting.
 However, whether we find other teams or not,
 we return to this place.
 Got it?
 Okay.
 Roger.
 Okay. Scatter!
 Bushy-Brow’s Pledge: Undying Love and Protection!
 I can’t fall asleep...
 I need to protect these two.
 I slept great!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 Did you take care of us?
 Thank you, Sakura!
 We’re totally better because of you!
 That’s good...
 A prey must always stay tense and flee desperately
 in front of the predator!
 My voice is gone!
 It was just a dream...
 Is it daybreak already?!
 No, no way!
 A squirrel?
 Don’t surprise me like that!
 Oh!
 That was too close.
 Do you think she noticed?
 The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
 No, that’s not it.
 Huh? Then what? What was it?
 We’ll probably find out if we go closer.
 So... we should get going now.
 If I can catch all twenty of these leaves before they hit the ground
 Sakura will start to like me.
 If... if I can’t catch even one of the leaves...!
 It’ll be an unanswered love forever. Or rather…
 You’re too Bushy!
 That’s what she’ll say.
 One, two, three, four... five, six, seven, eight...
 nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,  fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
 nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...
 One more!
 That’s…!
 Phew... just in time.
 This is called a Paper Bomb and it explodes after some time.
 Who did such an awful thing?
 Stop hiding and come out.
 Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
 Man, he’s a damn pain and we've been discovered!
 Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,” was a failure!
 So now we carry out Strategy Two!
 Huh? Are you serious?
 What? You have a problem with that?
 There’s no question of success.
 Well, I guess it’s all right but...
 Wow! To meet last year’s Number One rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
 C-Can I have your autograph?
 So it’s just you guys?
 Take that! Strategy Two, “head over heals infatuation with my sex appeal”!
 I’d been wanting to meet you for some time, you know?
 Get lost!
 Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?!
 Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
 Did you just raise your fists to me, and does that mean you want to fight?
 N-No... 					Of course not.
 Then get lost.
 Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps  like you
 would only make me the laughing stock of the village.
 Y-Yes!
 Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
 Just as I thought.
 A fellow like that wouldn’t take a scroll away from wimps like us
 unless we were to turn on him.
 All right! Let’s go find some wimps!
 Like I’ve been saying there’s no one wimpier than us...
 So a no-sleep lookout?
 But it’s not necessary anymore.
 Wake Sasuke up. We want to battle with him.
 Y-You bastards…
 What’re you saying?
 What is it you’re after?
 I know the one called Orochimaru is calling the shots from the shadows!
 Huh?!
 What’s that strange bruise on the back of Sasuke’s neck?
 You did this to Sasuke.
 How can you say you want to fight him?!
 I wonder…what he has on his mind?
 However, I can’t stay quiet after hearing that.
 I will kill this girl, I’ll also kill this Sasuke character.
 Wait, Zaku.
 Huh? What is it?
 It’s so cliché.
 It’s the color of dirt  that’s just been dug up.
 This grass, it doesn’t grow in a place like this, does it?
 Darn!
 You know, with a trap...
 there’s no point unless you make it so it’s not discovered.
 Huh, how ridiculous!
 So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel wouldn’t be caught in the trap ?
 We kill her now!
 A log?!
 A trap above too? Watch out!
 Just kidding.
 What?!
 Clearly you have no talent.
 Someone like you needs to make more of an effort or else!
 Leaf Hurricanes!
 What?! This guy...
 Then you also should... make an effort!
 Who are you?
 I’m the beautiful blue beast of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
 Why are you here?
 I will always appear...
 whenever you’re in trouble!
 Or should I say...
 It was really because of you, now run along.
 But right now, I’m also your enemy!
 I did say this once before, didn’t I?
 That I’ll protect you until I die.
 Please go out with me!
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Oh...
 T-Thanks.
 Yes!
 Perfect! I did it! Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
 I guess it can’t be helped...
 Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke.
 I will kill them!
 As far as I can tell,  Sakura is in no condition to fight.
 That Bushy-Brow guy is  pretty proficient with Taijutsu...
 Looks like I can have some fun!
 There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there?
 I won’t just simply avoid it.
 You showed me your Jutsu before.
 This guy…he’s strong.
 Having said that,
 the odds aren’t good since it’s one versus three.
 I’m gonna have to take a chance.
 One person at a time...
 I’ll give it my all and take each down!
 There’s no one at all that seems wimpy!
 Well, the only team that’s weaker than us is the Naruto team.
 Idiot! You know what you’re saying?
 What?!
 No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
 But that team has the super genius Sasuke!
 Hah! I wonder...
 In actual battle that genius might easily be beaten.
 What?!
 All right, all right, I apologize for irritating you.
 What a pain...
 I say one negative thing about Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every time…
 There’s no way Sasuke could be taken down!
 Sakura’s a different matter though!
 Huh?!
 Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
 Huh?!
 ...and Sakura is fighting.
 What did you say?
 Hey!
 He’s late.
 That Lee...
 Something’s not right.
 He’s always precise about time.
 Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
 Could it be...?
 Huh, that wouldn’t have happened.
 In any case, let’s find Lee!
 Right!
 Yes! I’ve finally mastered it! Yes! Yes!
 My friends, there’s no reason to give up on your youth!
 This Jutsu...
 In the end, only Lee  could make it his own.
 Yahoo!
 – Hey Lee... – I did it! I will do it!
 – Lee! 					– When I try! I try!
 Hey, Lee!
 Hey!
 Listen to this passionate message from your teacher!
 Oh... what is it?!
 Please tell me using hip words.
 This Jutsu, the “Lotus”...
 it will be dealt with henceforth as a forbidden Jutsu.
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 W-What do you mean?
 This Jutsu poses a great burden on the cells of the muscles,
 it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.”
 Humans normally utilize, at most, 20 percent...
 of the “power” that the muscles have.
 Do you understand? Only 20 percent!
 And if nearly 100 percent of the “power” is used
 the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
 So, the brain usually controls the “power.”
 However, this Jutsu forces the brain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra,
 allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
 In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu which relies on a secret technique
 that brings forth “power” almost  to the limit of one’s body.
 So the only time it is all right to use this Jutsu
 is when a certain condition is met...
 So... when is that?
 Take this to heart...
 The condition is
 Guy Sensei...
 I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
 Because this is the time you said...
 ""When protecting a previous person!""
 He disappeared?!
 Oh, oh no!
 There's no way he can break his fall!
 Take this!
 Primary Lotus!
 This feeling...
 Well well...
 Just in time.
 T-That's impossible!
 That is a frightening Jutsu...
 It did this much even though I fell on the spongy dirt.
 It's now my turn.
 Oh no!
 With what I just did...
 Lee!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that
 and is the speed of sound!
 I'll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 I'm so frustrated!
 I'm just pulling feet again.
 I'm always just being protected.
 I always just watch them from behind.
 This time, I need to protect everyone!
 Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!
 I want to be like you too!

186,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 The End of Tears
 By special…
 By special, you meant that?!
 I don’t feel like I’m gonna lose.
 Sasuke…you…
 If they continue to be released for a long period of time,
 Curse Marks will progressively eat your body.
 When they have entirely eaten you…
 you will lose yourself…forever.
 This body…
 It looks like there’s no time to waste.
 I don’t have any feeling in my left arm…
 That power you have…
 seems to involve some risks too, huh?
 Did you know…?
 That this place…
 is called the Final Valley.
 I think this is the perfect stage, don’t you think…Naruto?
 Oh yeah…
 I said there’d be no more talking, didn’t I?
 Well, in that case, how about we bring it to a close…?
 This battle.
 All our battles up to now!
 Next for Squad Seven. Naruto Uzumaki!
 Sakura Haruno!
 Yipeee!
 With Naruto…?
 And Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yipeee!
 With Sasuke…?
 Try not to slow me down, loser.
 You…!
 But…but…but…you told us…
 That’s why they……
 Aren’t we a three-man squad?
 That’s right! We three are one!
 Hey!
 Are you hurt? 					Scaredy Cat?
 Hey…are you hurt? Scaredy Cat?
 You are one of the ones I want to fight.
 Sasuke!
 I want…to fight you, too.
 I don’t want to see any more deaths
 of my precious comrades.
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I…will protect Sakura!
 What’s so funny?
 Nothing’s funny, believe it! I'm happy!
 When I think I can finally beat you here!
 What did you say?! Don't talk foolish, you failure!
 I’m not going to be a failure forever!
 Just bring it, now!
 Put on your headband before that! I’ll wait.
 I don’t need such a thing…
 Just do it!
 You wouldn’t even be able to put one wound on my forehead!
 You’re wrong!
 I’m saying this is a testament
 to fighting on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!
 Naruto!
 Sasuke!
 I’ll win no matter what!
 Don’t flatter yourself!
 Stop it!
 And from this time onward…
 Chidori!
 Rasengan!
 – Rasengan! 					– Chidori!
 – Chidori! 					– Rasengan!
 This Chakra…
 This isn’t good!
 Naruto…
 I…
 It’s started to rain! Will it erase the scent?
 No problem.
 We’re already close. This way.
 Was I too late…?
 Naruto!
 Why did things come to this?!
 This is Sasuke’s…
 I didn’t make it in time… please forgive me.
 Naruto…
 I know the kind of person you are…
 You must have made a desperate effort.
 Sasuke…
 That’s my boy…
 With me, you’re all your father talks about…
 You are my one and only brother.
 I will continue to be for you…
 a wall that you must find a way to cross over.
 Even if you were to hate me…
 You are someone
 who can obtain Mangekyo Sharingan just like me…
 However, on one condition.
 Your closest friend…
 The Final Valley…
 To think that Sasuke and Naruto would battle it out here…
 How ironic…
 Yeah…
 When I look at the flow of this water,
 it’s as if I’m being confronted by an eternal, never-ending battle…
 Just like the fate of the two people depicted in these statues here
 who founded the Village Hidden in the Leaves…
 Naruto and Sasuke, as long as you both live…
 You have to kill…
 your closest friend!
 I'm not gonna…
 abide by everything you say!
 I will get my hands on power doing it my own way!
 I will surpass you doing it my own way!
 Without fail!
 The rain’s…let up, hasn’t it?
 Yeah.
 With that much rain,
 I won’t be able to pursue the scent anymore.
 Naruto is more important now than pursuing Sasuke.
 Yeah.
 It’s gotten interesting, hasn’t it?
 Yeah…
 When I recalled the parts one by one,
 I felt as though I had understood everything
 Faded words which I kept so close to me
 Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,
 and this distant yearning for you
 I live, simply repeating this cycle
 Held in my two hands A droplet of time
 Softly clutching forgotten memories Lost words
 I’ll keep these thoughts…
 I’m sorry. I’m really sorry, Sakura.
 I made a once-in-a-lifetime promise that I would bring Sasuke back.
 But, I’m not finished yet!
 I’ll fulfill my promise, no matter what!
 Since that was what I was always saying…
 that I won’t go back on my word.
 That’s my Way of Ninja!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning

 Akamaru Trembles: Gaara’s Cruel Strength!
 That guy...?
 Everyone hide!
 No, lie low quick!
 W-Where is that guy?
 Naruto...
 That fool, he finally woke up.
 You are quite one of a kind.
 Actually, you are getting on my nerves.
 Sakura!
 – What? 					– Y-Y-Your...!
 Sakura... your hair!
 Oh! This...?
 I’m changing my image, changing my image!
 I like it better long but,
 when I move around in a forest like this,
 it gets in the way if it’s long.
 By the way...
 why are you guys here?!
 Hah... It’s such a pain to explain it to you.
 Everybody helped out.
 Huh?
 Sakura’s putting on a show of bravado...
 I’ll take care of him from here.
 Ah... Okay...
 Keep it together! Lee!
 Oh? Tenten, why are you here?
 I came to help.
 Huh...?
 Those guys, where’s the Sound Village Ninjas?
 A kid named Sasuke drove them away!
 Really…
 Why did you hastily decided to act on your own?!
 Besides, you really got beaten up!
 S-Sakura was in danger. So as a man, I...
 You’re kidding...!
 If it were Lee alone, he wouldn’t have lost to those guys.
 You’re really stupid.
 I can’t argue with that.
 You, Bushy-Brow!
 Naruto!
 Don’t say rude things to Lee!
 What in the world...
 happened while I was asleep?
 That Naruto, he’s completely out of the loop.
 He’s not the type to be the protagonist of a story, certainly not.
 Lee...
 Thank you.
 Because of you, I was able to wake up.
 I feel like I’ve gotten a little stronger!
 Sakura...
 It looks like my efforts weren’t enough!
 Sasuke... Just what you’d expect from the Uchiha clan.
 To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,
 just as I thought, you possess amazing strength.
 I was beaten to a pulp.
 What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!
 What’s he talking about?
 Were those guys really that strong?
 Sakura!
 The Lotus of Leaf Village blooms twice.
 Huh?
 When we meet again, I will have become a stronger man.
 I pledge it.
 Okay.
 Hey Sakura!
 Come here, come here!
 Your hair! I’ll fix it for you!
 That'd be great.
 You are really sneaky.
 Hugging him like that, you little billboard brow.
 It’s called first come-first served, Miss Ino-pig.
 Sasuke... Uchiha.
 At any rate…he’s a strong opponent.
 Are you okay, Akamaru?
 Is he still shaking?
 It’s already been half a day.
 Akamaru...
 I don’t blame him,  it’s because he saw that thing...
 After all, brains are most important in survival!
 Right. Akamaru?
 Lucky for us,
 the guys who got caught in the trap had an earth scroll!
 We’ll be the first to the tower at this rate!
 Don’t get carried away. That’s dangerous.
 No matter how small a bug it is, it has to guard itself at all times.
 We have to pay attention to avoid coming across any enemies...
 This is safety.
 I know that!
 As always, you’re speaking in a way that’s difficult to understand, bug-nerd.
 Um... B-But... What Shino said...
 He has a point.
 I know! C’mon.
 Naruto...
 I hope nothing’s happened to him...
 Hey you two, stop.
 We’re being careful not to come across enemy, right?
 Then Hinata!
 Can you see 1 kilometer in that direction?
 Yep... I’ll have a look. Byakugan!
 T-There’s someone there.
 Evidently there are... 6 people…
 Okay! Let’s go look!
 Huh?
 Kiba! What are you saying? We’re not doing that.
 The Proctor told us to bring
 one of each “Heaven” and “Earth” scroll in a pair.
 He didn’t say not to take more than that.
 If we take more, that means some other teams will be left out.
 B-But...
 We’ll just see what’s going on at first..
 If it looks too dangerous, we won’t battle for no reason.
 – Let’s go! 					– Oh!
 He’s an irritating type, that one.
 What’s up, Akamaru?
 What happened? You stopped suddenly.
 Akamaru suddenly got frightened.
 W-Why is that?
 Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy’s Chakra and tell his strength.
 But this is the first time I’ve seen him this scared.
 The people going at it up ahead aren’t ordinary guys...
 Sand Village kids coming to challenge us forthright.
 It’s foolish.
 What’s that little guy thinking to get involved with those guys...?!
 W-What is Akamaru saying...?
 He’s saying that big guy is dangerous.
 T-They certainly look like bad news...
 They seem really strong.
 Hey, kids, you should pick your opponents...
 You’re all going to die.
 That’s enough of you.
 Let’s do this quickly... old chap from Hidden Rain Village.
 Which scroll do those guys have...
 Hey Gaara!
 Doesn’t it make sense to follow them
 and gather information before hunting them?
 If they have the same type of scroll there’s no need to fight.
 Unnecessary battles are….
 It doesn’t matter.
 If their eyes meet with mine... I’ll kill them all.
 That’s why I don’t want  to be with this guy.
 Well, let’s do it. Quickly!
 Die, kid!
 Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
 Hidden Senbons!
 Up down right left, there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.
 In addition, all the Senbons are controlled by my Chakra
 and attack on the intended prey!
 Too easy.
 Is that all?
 I-It can’t be...?!
 Not even one...?
 No wounds...? Ridiculous!
 Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?
 Well, I’ll make it rain blood.
 What a giant Chakra.
 And, that sand...
 It smells terrible.
 Smell?
 A strong smell of blood...
 Wall of sand...?
 That’s right. An absolute defense by sand!
 He manipulates sand inside a gourd and
 hardens it with magnified Chakra.
 It defends the circumference of Gaara’s body.
 It’s a Jutsu that only he can get away with...
 Furthermore, it’s somehow always automatically done
 without Gaara’s intentions.
 Which means that all attacks in front of Gaara fade into nothing.
 That little...
 You guys can’t defeat our Gaara.
 Don’t underestimate me!
 This guy's a goner…
 That’s what you get for rebelling against Gaara...
 Sand Coffin!
 I can’t move...
 T-This won’t...!
 I can cover your loud mouth and kill you.
 But that’s too pathetic.
 Sand Burial!
 There’s no pain.
 I knocked him even harder than was necessary.
 The bloody tears of a corpse merge with vast sinking sand
 and provide more power to the demon of war.
 T-The scroll.
 We’ll give it to you!
 Please! Let us go!
 No-o-o-!
 T-This is bad.
 Let’s escape quickly! lf he finds us he’ll kill us!
 Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.
 Okay! Let’s go to the tower.
 Shut up.
 It’s still…not enough for me!
 U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!
 Let’s quit... Gaara.
 Are you scared, coward?
 Gaara! It’s certainly no problem for you, but it’s too dangerous for us!
 One set of scrolls is good.
 More than this is...
 Lame people don’t give directions to me.
 That’s enough!
 How about if you sometimes listen to what your big brother has to say?!
 I’ve never thought of you as my siblings.
 If you get in my way... I’ll kill you.
 G-Gaara cut it out! Please.
 Don’t say something so cold.
 As a favor to your sister... Okay?!
 Gaara!
 Fine.
 That’s why I hate brats.
 What? So that’s it Akamaru?
 C’mon, you should have said something sooner.
 Nobody’s here...?
 Heh heh! We’re the first?!
 No, I sensed someone a little while ago.
 More importantly, is Akamaru okay?
 He’s been scared ever since then.
 Now that you mention it, what did Akamaru say before?
 Oh... Akamaru said that it was dangerous
 because that sand squirt would kill that big guy.
 Sheesh! Just like I thought, there’s no other place to go!
 They’ve already made us wait for half a day!
 How much longer do we have to wait?
 Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...
 I don’t know what he is but, that guy…
 He’s too dangerous.
 It’s becoming a real disaster, but we can’t cancel this test.
 What do you mean?
 Excuse me!
 What is it?! We’re talking about something important!
 Excuse me.
 But... Uh...
 Please take a look at this!
 The video...?
 Ready? Here! Look at the time!
 T-This is…
 It’s a recording inside the tower,
 one hour and thirty-seven minutes after the start of the second test!
 Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village broke through the second test.
 This can’t be...!
 In a mere ninety-seven minutes...
 This has never happened!
 This is an anomaly.
 Those guys are not Genin level.
 They’ve rewritten the fastest time by four hours…
 It’s not just that.
 What do you mean?
 It’s 10 kilometers from the test entrances to the tower.
 Ferocious animals, poisonous insects, the rugged forest road...
 As if those were not there…
 Especially the brown-haired kid right in front…
 What about him?
 You don’t notice?
 I see. This is quite a surprise.
 What about him is so...?
 Look closely at his body.
 I see.
 He doesn’t have a single scratch.
 What’s worse, there's not a smudge of dirt on his clothing.
 Even I...
 No, any of the other Chunin...
 It’s impossible for us to make it to this tower without a scratch.
 It’s likely that it has something to do with his ability.
 After a long time, a dependable guy has appeared.
 Even though he’s got evil eyes.
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 – Please! 					– No!
 – Just a little bit. 					– No!
 – Really only a little bit. – No means no!
 I’ll just look a little and put it back.
 Remember what the Proctors said, loser.
 When they say don’t look, don’t look,
 it just makes me want to look all the more!
 If you can look when you can, let’s look!
 Naruto lost it!
 Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

188,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Mystery of the Targeted Merchants
 Did they really come this way?
 But why come this way?
 They shouldn’t come this way if it’s as you say, Choji.
 I said that because I didn’t think we were being targeted.
 I don’t think this is the time to argue…
 We have to formulate some sort of strategy.
 You say that, but…
 What is it?
 Have the guys you spoke of caught up?
 Then we should divide up this group in two.
 Here it’s hard enough to protect one.
 What’s the point of dividing  the group in two?
 N-Naruto!
 Please, tell us what your idea is.
 This is what I mean.
 For example…
 Let’s say there are  ten persimmons here.
 Is anything okay if it’s a food?
 Yeah.
 Then I want it to be ramen!
 Naruto, it’s an example, so…
 Then we’ll make it ramen.
 Someone is after these ten bowls of ramen.
 And there are three people  to protect the ramen.
 And so one person has to protect roughly three bowls.
 No, no. If it’s ramen,
 we should just eat it all before they come.
 That would settle things.
 N-Naruto. This ramen is for delivery to someone,
 so we can’t eat it.
 Really? But the ramen won’t be tasty if it gets soggy.
 I’m moving on.
 If three people protect ten bowls of ramen,
 one person protects about three bowls.
 But this ramen has legs for escaping.
 Ramen with legs for escaping?!
 Five bowls of ramen quick to escape…
 and five bowls of ramen slow to escape.
 Right, right.. Things are kind of getting crazy.
 I see. If we divide them into two groups…
 Of course, the pursuers would target the group that is slow to escape first.
 So we have one person  defend the preceding group
 and two people for the group that is slow to escape.
 Right, right.
 By doing this, as for protecting  the slow group,
 now one person can just protect two and a half bowls.
 Oh!
 In other words, the ramen that are quick to escape are the young people
 and the ramen that are slow to escape are the elderly people and children, right?
 Exactly. Not only will the possibility of
 the former to completely get away increase,
 the burden on the latter to protect will decrease.
 It’s a strategy that kills two birds  with one stone.
 You’re smart.
 However… the elderly people and children will…
 I just stated a rational idea.
 There’s the possibility
 of complete annihilation if we stay in a group.
 Am I wrong, Yurinoshin?
 Well…
 Then it’s settled. Let’s divide everyone up in two.
 I’m sorry, gramps.
 Don’t worry about it.
 It would be trouble if something bad were to happen to the men in their prime.
 You’ve got a wife and kid at home, right?
 Then we’ll be going on ahead first, Naruto, Choji.
 Right. We’re counting on you, Hinata.
 Naruto and I will deal with the pursuers.
 Right. I’ll protect them well.
 Lady Haruna.
 Yurinoshin, keep your mouth shut. What’s your mission?
 Is it not to protect me?
 Things will be settled if Kikusuke defeats those guys.
 Then shall we get going, too?
 I’m counting on you, Brother Choji.
 Right! 					Leave it to me!
 Choji.
 You go on ahead.
 What?
 I’m going back to check things out at the place where the traps are.
 But if you do that, you may encounter  the pursuers along the way…
 That’s fine.
 Doing something like waiting  to be attacked isn’t my style!
 Naruto!
 Leave it to me!
 I meant…
 There’s no point to our strategy
 if I have to protect five people  by myself.
 Right, there’s no point.
 We came down that path,
 so the trap should be up ahead somewhere.
 I guess I’ll take a shortcut!
 What’s this? 					What happened?
 Why is it so wet?
 What’re these wounds?!
 This guy’s…!
 Are you serious?
 Is something wrong, Brother Choji?
 No, nothing.
 I see…
 I feel it.
 Even I can sense this much bloodlust.
 It’s close now.
 Huh?
 Rain?
 This is the worst. Rain wipes out all presence of the enemy.
 Oh…
 This rain is weird.
 Gather around, everyone!
 Stay close to me.
 What’s…this?
 This is bad!
 What was that now?!
 Everyone! Get under the cart!
 We’re already under here!
 You’re quick!
 Choji!
 Naruto!
 Get down!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! Could you say so at the start
 if you’re going to use paper bombs?
 All right. It seems they’re gone.
 Why did they disappear?
 Isn’t it obvious?
 They have no business with a shop that doesn’t have the thing they want.
 Thing they want?
 That’s right.
 If a shop’s sold out of the item you want,
 you’d go to another shop, right?
 Could it be that the thing that he wants is in the other group?
 What does that mean?!
 Hinata’s in danger!
 Everyone, leave your stuff here and take only what you need!
 Hinata is?!
 Everyone, we’ll put up our tents here  for today and rest.
 It’s dangerous to move in the dark.
 Hey!
 We finally caught up.
 Naruto, Choji. What is it?
 “What is it,” nothing. The situation has changed.
 It seems someone among these people
 is hiding something important.
 Something important?
 It should probably have something to do with us being chased.
 But who is hiding what?
 It’s most likely you guys, Shun and Yurinoshin.
 Don’t be silly! What’re you saying we’re hiding?
 Don’t play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killed by someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 Don’t play innocent!
 Kikusuke has been killed by someone!
 What?!
 Kikusuke was?!
 Why should he have to suit up like a Shinobi,
 fight those guys and then get killed?!
 It’s not necessary to tell you guys.
 But if that’s why we’re being chased…
 It means you guys are putting everyone in danger.
 If you don’t tell us honestly,
 we won’t be able to protect  even what we can protect.
 Kikunojou…
 Kikunojou?
 You mean Kikusuke?
 Yes… And my name isn’t Yurinoshin.  It’s Yurinojou.
 Stop, Yurinojou!
 The person here is Lady Haruna,
 the only daughter of the feudal lord of the Land of Greens.
 Princess?!
 Princess Haruna of the Land of Greens. You’ve grown up so much…
 P-Princess…?
 You were a woman?!
 Lady Haruna, it is as these people say.
 We must not put everyone in danger by hiding the truth any further.
 But why is someone like a princess  mingling among merchants?
 There was information of a coup in the Land of Greens.
 A coup?
 The Land of Greens was a small, but calm and peaceful land.
 However, it was by no means a prosperous land.
 Before we realized it,
 more than half of the public officials  had been bought off.
 Who in the world would do that…?
 The ringleaders are three brothers called the Janin,
 evil Ninja who came from  across the sea.
 Janin?
 Yes. They’re guys who use a particular type of Ninjutsu
 and are called as such because of their frightfulness.
 They’ve taken many lives and think nothing of it
 if it’s for their own gains.
 They treat people like worms…
 But why the Land of Greens?
 I don’t know why.
 But his lordship had Lady Haruna hide amongst a group of merchants
 and got her out of the land.
 Kikunojou and I were left with the protection of the princess,
 but we were insecure with just the two of us.
 So then we hurriedly commissioned the Hidden Leaf
 under the pretext of protection from bandits.
 Why didn’t you tell us  something that important?
 There’s no way I could have. My escape is top secret.
 Besides, what would happen  if I were to have told you?
 The end result would’ve been  you guys running away in confusion.
 No way would I do something  like run away.
 Kikunojou might not have had to die if
 we had understood the situation  from the start.
 I wonder.
 One of you guys might’ve ended up like Kikunojou.
 We’re actually fine.
 But to think you’d go so far as to involve the old lady and the children.
 It couldn’t be!
 Were you intending to use  the old lady and the kids as decoys
 and escape just yourself?!
 That’s right. What of it?
 Choji! Hinata!
 As for me, I’m really tickedoff right now!
 So what of it?!
 If something should happen  in the land,
 I would become the only blood relative
 of the feudal lord of  the Land of Greens.
 If I can just survive, things could be restored someday,
 even if the Land of Greens were to be destroyed.
 Say what?! Just what is it you think of people’s lives?!
 Please forgive her.
 Yurinojou.
 Is it not your mission to protect me?
 You’re still talking about such things…?
 Please wait, Naruto!
 Lady Haruna, that’s true for me.
 However, these people are different.
 The mission they undertook was to protect merchants.
 It was not to protect us.
 Indeed, what we heard about
 was a D-rank mission to protect all of the merchants.
 Protecting a prominent figure of a land is an A-rank mission.
 The rank differs by far too much.
 Are you guys saying you’re going to forsake me?
 Weren’t you saying until just now
 that you didn’t trust people like us?
 I’ll protect you with my life, Lady Haruna…
 Shut up, Yurinojou! Kikunojou was your senior disciple.
 There’s no way you alone could defeat an opponent
 whom he couldn’t defeat!
 That will just be our destiny when that happens, Lady Haruna.
 Watch, Brother Choji.
 Oh! Awesome, awesome.
 I’m sorry about earlier.
 It happened so suddenly, I couldn’t stop.
 Don’t be concerned about me.
 However, please forgive Lady Haruna.
 The Land of Greens is a small land.
 For the sake of the land’s survival,
 Lady Haruna was kept under  the custody of another land,
 as a hostage all by herself since she was little.
 Hostage?
 It frequently happens in a small land in a war-torn world.
 When Lady Haruna returned  from the other land,
 she had completely lost her feelings of trust towards people.
 Lady Haruna is also a victim of a turbulent world.
 There’s a village
 about one league down  the mountain from here.
 For the time being,
 we’ll leave the old woman  and the others there.
 Be careful now.
 You guys, too!
 Bye!
 Why are you separating them from us?
 They still have value for my personal use.
 Are you still going on about that?
 They went so far as to discard  their merchandise for your sake.
 Then we should also leave this place.
 We must not.
 If we go into hiding,
 there’s a possibility of that group being attacked again.
 Exactly. This time, it’s our turn to be the decoy
 in order to protect them.
 Do as you like!
 Hinata, I’ll take care of things here. Please rest a while.
 Yeah, do that.
 Th-Then, if you insist.
 Oh, yeah. Here. Kikunojou was holding this.
 Thanks, Naruto.
 Kikunojou was a master of the Flower Ninjutsu
 passed down in the Land of Greens.
 We learned together  when we were little
 and I couldn’t beat him even once…
 Now I have forever lost  the chance to beat him.
 No… You still have a chance.
 What?
 If you beat the guy who defeated Kikunojou,
 you will have beaten Kikunojou!
 Naruto… You’re exactly right…!
 Here they come!
 Other than the fact that the enemy uses water,
 we have absolutely no idea what they’ll come at us with.
 I know.
 Go! Flower Ninja Art:! Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage.
 What?!
 He changed the trajectory in mid-air?!
 Oh, no!
 I finally got you!
 Gotcha.
 To think you’d make me look like a fool.
 So you finally show yourself.
 I will avenge Kikunojou!
 Try it if you can.
 I won’t let you get away!
 Too bad. You’re one person short.
 I’ve set a share for one more.
 I don’t know about that.
 First, I’ll take care of you, boy.
 Water Style: Liquid Memory!
 Naruto…!
 And this!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 What is it?
 Is that…?
 The Jutsu that killed Kikunojou?!
 Vanish and die!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 What is this huge thing?
 I don’t wanna become its food.
 Let me tell you one thing. I’m not tasty.
 I’m not tasty, either.
 But Choji would be more worthwhile to eat.
 No, Naruto would be tastier.
 Be eaten for the sake of your comrade.
 You’re the one who will become it food.
 This isn’t the time to be arguing  about stuff like that.
 Yurinojou!
 Anyway, we just have to run with all our might for now!

189,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 What's with you?!
 Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!
 Good morning!
 Here.
 Thank you.
 Naruto didn't come back last night, either?
 He's such a fool,
 he's been out every night, climbing trees.
 He might be dead already from using up too much Chakra.
 I wonder if Naruto's okay.
 To think a child's out in the middle of the night.
 Well, you don't need to worry.
 Although he may not seem to be, he's a full-fledged Ninja.
 I wonder…
 That idiot's probably all pooped out right about now.
 Sasuke?
 I'm going for a walk.
 But we're about to eat…
 That was fast!
 You'll catch a cold if you keep sleeping here.
 Who're you?
 Uh... Did you wake me up, sis? I mean, what're you doing here?
 I'm gathering medicinal herbs.
 Herbs?
 Yes. For healing injuries, sickness and the like.
 You got a lot to do early in the morning, sis...
 You, too.
 What've you been doing in a place like this so early?
 Training!
 Could it be that… you're a Ninja or something?
 What with that headband and…
 Is that what I look like? Is it?
 Yup! I'm a Ninja!
 No kidding. You're great, aren't you.
 But…why are you training?
 As for me, I want to get stronger!
 But, you already look strong enough.
 No, no! I want to get even stronger!
 What for?
 To become the best Ninja in my village!
 I'm going to get everyone to recognize my strength!
 And I have to prove something to a certain person!
 Is that for the sake of somebody? Or is it for your own sake?
 Huh?
 What's so funny?!
 Do you have somebody precious in your life?
 Precious…?
 What is it you want to say, sis?
 What is it?
 When a person has something precious they want to protect…
 that's when they can truly become strong.
 Your dad loves the town you're from, so…
 I absolutely won't allow my comrades to get killed!
 Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!
 I'll kill you!!
 Yeah! I know that well, too!
 You'll get strong.
 Yeah!
 I hope we meet again somewhere.
 Oh…and…
 I'm a man!
 That can't be! He's cuter than Sakura.
 Why? That's strange.
 This world is full of mystery…
 Ouch. Hey! What're you doing?!
 Did you forget about mealtime, you idiot?
 Naruto?
 What in the world is Naruto doing?
 And Sasuke hasn't come back from his walk either…
 No way… Naruto can climb that high now?
 Wow!
 How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!
 As for me, I can climb this high now!
 Whoa!
 Oh, you idiot!
 This is bad!
 Gotcha!
 You fell for it, you fell for it!
 Don't scare us like that!
 I'll kill him later! Cha!
 He's grown a little, eh.
 Oh! You idiot, Naruto!
 It's cuz you went overboard!
 You fool.
 Sasuke…?
 Nice, Sasuke. You're awesome !
 These kids are really growing.
 Naruto…
 Uzumaki, eh.
 You've recovered considerably.
 All right…
 Just a little more, Haku.
 Yes.
 Shall we go back?
 Okay!
 They're late.
 And not just Naruto, but even Sasuke too.
 What happened to you guys?
 You're really muddy and really wiped out.
 We both…climbed up to the top.
 Good.
 Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding Tazuna next time!
 Got it! Whoa!
 You idiot!
 In just a teeny little bit, the bridge will be complete.
 It's thanks to you guys.
 Even so, don't let your guard down…
 I've really wanted to ask  you for a long time now…
 But why are you still here even though I lied about the mission?
 To see what is right without doing it bespeaks an absence of courage.
 Like master, like man.
 It's a teaching of the late Hokage.
 The things I truly hold dear to myself…
 I'll protect until the very end with both these arms.
 Don't cry…lnari.
 Why…?
 What is it?
 Why do you desperately work so hard until you get like that?!
 There's no way you'd be a match for Gato's men even if you train!
 No matter what cool things you say or how much effort you make…
 the weak always lose out…
 against the truly strong!
 Shut up. I'm not like you.
 Shut up! Looking at you makes me sick!
 Sticking your nose in even though you know nothing of this land!
 I'm not like you who's always acting frivolous
 not knowing one thing about pain!
 So you're just gonna cry all day like the lead in a tragedy?
 An idiot like you can just cry forever! You crybaby!
 Naruto! That's a bit harsh!
 Naruto…
 Got a minute?
 Naruto didn't mean any harm with what he said…
 He's just uncouth, so…
 We heard the story about your father from Tazuna.
 Like you, Naruto never had a father as a young child…
 Actually he doesn't know either of his parents.
 Not only that. He didn't have a single friend.
 What?
 However…
 I've never seen him sulk, be timid, or cry.
 He's always eager, wanting to be acknowledged by someone.
 If it's for the sake of that ""dream,"" he always risks his life.
 He's probably tired of crying.
 So, he knows the true meaning of the word strong.
 Like your father.
 Naruto might understand your feelings the most.
 What Naruto said earlier…
 There's no mistaking that he's told himself that over and over again.
 Okay, then! I leave Naruto in your hands.
 Because he's used his body to the limit…
 I don't think he'll be able to move today.
 Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?
 Yes, somehow.
 We'll be going!
 What're you doing?
 I didn't hire you guys for charity work…
 Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?! Hey!!
 Shall we go…Haku?
 Yes.
 I overslept!
 Hey hey!! Where is everyone?
 Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you to rest and relax…today
 I knew it.
 They left me behind.
 I'll be back.
 Darn it! They could've woken me up!
 W-What the heck is this?!
 What is going on? What's happened?
 It couldn't be…
 Inari! Give me a hand.
 Inari!?
 I'll be right there.
 This mist…
 Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!
 I knew he was still alive.
 Making an appearance so soon, eh…
 Say, Kakashi Sensei.
 This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!
 Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.
 I see you've got those brats with you as always.
 He's still trembling. Poor thing.
 I'm trembling with…excitement.
 Do it, Sasuke.
 I can see it!
 Well-well. So he could see the Water Clones, eh.
 That brat's grown quite a bit.
 This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
 So it seems.
 Phew, that was a close shave.
 Sorry I was late. But Inari, you were great.
 I was able to save your mom thanks to your courage.
 Hey, wait a minute.
 Doesn't the fact that we were attacked mean
 that Kakashi Sensei and the others are in danger too?!

190,"So this is the Shukaku?
 It’s the first time I’ve seen the real thing…
 It’s dangerous here! We have to get away!
 But! Gaara Sensei…
 Shut up.
 Gaara is trying…to protect you!
 So hurry!
 R-Right.
 Hey! Could that be…?!
 Yeah…
 The Shukaku transformation is starting.
 Gaara…
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Hinata, Sakura.
 Matsuri, you okay?
 Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei…
 I leave her to you…
 Hold it! You are badly hurt!
 But…
 You’ll just become unable to move right away!
 I’ll give you some first-aid treatment!
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Departure
 This is bad… It’s a matter of time.
 I knew it.
 Sakura! Hurry! lt looks like we don’t have much time!
 Got it! First, put your hands out.
 R-Right…
 What’s the meaning of this?
 What is it, Neji?
 That guy wearing the armor is releasing Chakra stronger than Gaara…
 who’s half transformed into a beast.
 That person called himself Seimei, the creator of the Village of Artisans.
 He said something about being reborn as the ultimate Ninja tool.
 That jerk! He’s taken away Gaara’s Chakra!
 Come to think of it, the enemy we fought wore similar armor…
 and took away a great deal of my Chakra.
 Armor that sucks up Chakra…
 And that alarming form…
 It doesn’t look like we can just carelessly get close.
 Now… What do we do?
 I didn’t figure on fighting against the Shukaku…
 However, this is fun, too.
 As great as the Shukaku may be, this way, I can prove that
 it’s no match for the ultimate Ninja tool of the Village of Artisans.
 Why is this guy so strong?
 I won’t allow my important people…
 to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you,
 even if that means that I have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other people…?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was…
 that’s why… they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 and to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 Gaara!
 What’s that? Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?
 What happened to him?!
 Gaara might be suppressing Shukaku of his own volition.
 Why? Wouldn’t he end up weakening his own battle strength?
 Even so, he chose to fight with his own strength and will,
 not Shukaku's power, which he can’t control.
 So you couldn’t maintain the Shukaku body with that Chakra?
 I’ll…help the friends important to me with my own power…
 How absurd.
 A Shinobi doesn’t need emotion.
 It is those who suppress their emotions who can obtain great power.
 Great power. That power is the only justice.
 You’re finished now.
 Eat this!
 That’s as far as you go, monster of the Sand Village.
 Acting tough, huh…?
 You shouldn’t have any Chakra left to fight with.
 Indeed,  I only have a little bit of Chakra left…
 But do you think I just sat around in the cage doing nothing at all?
 What?!
 Sand Tsunami!
 You shouldn’t have any sand you can control!
 I’m Gaara of the desert!
 It’s simple for me to crush rocks and turn them into sand.
 Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!
 So you still had that much power left, huh?
 Then I’ll just suck up all of that power!
 Gaara’s Chakra is being sucked out!
 – Wha--?! 					– Gaara Sensei!
 – Damn it! 					– Wait! Naruto!
 What, Shikamaru? Don’t stop me!
 You’ll just get in the way if you go!
 Besides, our Gaara is strong!
 Gaara…
 Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:
 Shukaku's Pike!
 Wh-Why…? Why could you…?
 Someone who gave up on being human and was reborn as a Ninja tool
 could never understand anyway.
 I don’t understand. Why?
 Why?!
 Giant Sand Burial!
 He did it!
 Gaara Sensei won!
 Yeah! Gaara!
 – Gaara! 					– Gaara!
 He’s okay…
 He’s just extremely fatigued
 on account of using his Chakra all at once.
 Gaara completely suppressed the Shukaku on his own volition.
 Yeah…
 I want to work hard
 and become an existence acknowledged by other people…
 I thought that looking at Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ties with other people…
 For me, until now, that was just hate and murderous intent.
 However, there’s something I’ve understood just a little…
 about the ties he goes so far for and talks about.
 Suffering, sorrow and happiness can be shared with someone.
 You’ve also made someone you can share with at last…
 Did you say something?
 No, nothing…
 We came to the trouble of rushing here.
 To think it’d be over…
 It seems the inexperienced knuckleheads
 have grown a teeny weeny bit…
 You are very strict.
 Pervy Sage!
 Oh, long time no see, Naruto.
 Don’t give me that “long time no see” garbage, you jerk Sage!
 You were talking all big about watching my training,
 making me into your protégé and stuff!
 Where were you traipsing around until now?!
 Well, how can I put this? I was gathering information.
 It was probably just information on naked ladies anyway, right?
 You idiot!
 Even I come through when it counts…
 I was mainly after information on the Akatsuki.
 Akatsuki!
 With this I’ve been able to verify their actions.
 And now as promised,
 two years later when they’ll move into high gear,
 I will thoroughly train you.
 I wonder if you’re prepared?
 I’ve been tired of waiting!
 I owe you one.
 No. I just repaid the debt from last time.
 Next time, I’ll settle things more properly.
 Well, this time I’ll acknowledge that you didn’t cry.
 Not again.
 Just like a woman…
 What about him?
 Huh?
 Naruto?
 I hear he’s leaving today on a training journey with Jiraiya.
 Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?
 Yeah. 					lt’s such a pain.
 He’s going to come back having gotten stronger again.
 See you around.
 – Farewell… 					– See ya.
 Please tell Naruto…
 Thanks to him,
 I figured out what the words Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.
 I’ll dedicate myself under Gaara Sensei from now on…
 What did he do?
 Well, I guess that’s about it.
 I read the Village of Artisans report from the other day.
 Although it didn’t go as far as a perfect 100,
 I’ll give you a passing grade.
 No! I’m still very much lacking in experience.
 Of course!
 I’ll have you carry out several missions
 and get you to build up lots of experience,
 so make sure to dedicate yourself!
 What?! Does that mean I’m totally going to get overworked?
 Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?
 Ino?
 Sure. What’s up?
 As, as it happens, I was thinking about it the while…
 But it became totally clear to me on this mission!
 Clear that I’d be no good at all at this rate!
 Ino.
 It’s frustrating, but I was envious of you.
 You, who everyone depended on.
 So, please. I also want to become a Medical Ninja.
 I know it’ll be hard.
 But I’ve got guts and I’ll manage the studying, no matter what.
 So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?
 – Sure. 					– Really?!
 But prepare yourself.
 Once that happens, you’ll be my little sister protégé.
 What’s that…?
 Naturally!
 After all, I’ll be your Medical Ninja superior, you know.
 Man, I can’t wait.
 You’ll be my lovable little sister protégé.
 I’ll train you nice and hard.
 Just you watch! I’ll pass you up right away!
 Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!
 I’ll do it! Billboard Brow!
 Why?! Why is it?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Why was I the only one left out of the mission the other day?!
 But you were with a different team then, right?
 But everyone had taken part!
 She’s kind of in a rage.
 It’s hard being the only one left out of a mission.
 Come to think of it,
 it seems Naruto finally leaves for training.
 I heard. It seems that Jiraiya is going to be his mentor.
 Damn it! That guy’s going to get strong again.
 It looks like the village will get quiet for a while.
 Viewed in that light, it’s a little bit sad, isn’t it?
 No! This isn’t the time to be getting sad!
 I must work hard!
 Several times more, several times more.
 If I don’t work hard hundreds of times more than Naruto,
 I won’t be able to face him the next time we meet.
 Your guard is off!
 We also must grow by that time.
 It’s because trying to improve by learning from others,
 that is what’s called friendship.
 Good grief, we’d better not lose, Akamaru.
 Same here!
 Hey, you okay, Lee?!
 I’m fine, I’m fine.
 Lady Hinata, let’s call it a day.
 What? I’m still…
 It’s about time for his departure.
 Oh!
 You won’t be able to see him for a while.
 I see… It looks like you’ll be on a long journey…
 Yeah!
 Listen up. Be sure to train and don’t goof off.
 Right! You can count on me!
 It’s about time to go, Naruto.
 Right!
 Okay! I’m off, Iruka Sensei!
 I’ll pay you back for the ramen once I’ve become a success.
 Jeez…
 Good luck, Naruto.
 Keep your eyes on me.
 What’re you doing?! I’ll leave you behind, Naruto.
 Hey. H-Hey, wait up!
 I also have to work hard in order to catch up with Naruto.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 It’s been two years since his departure.
 Now the count down to the battle begins.
 Those who pursue and those who are pursued.
 Time will not wait for the boy.
 As Akatsuki Organization begins to take action,
 the day of Orochimaru’s reincarnation draws near.
 In order to take back what he lost,
 the boy once again throws himself into the maelstrom of cruel fate…
 Next time: “Homecoming”

 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.

 ""The Special Presentation Today!""
 ""The Top 5 Famous Sweat and Tears Ninja Battles!
 ""There Are Also Fun Extras"" has finally started!
 Isn't this exciting, Sakura?!
 Yes, from the next episode,
 “Naruto” which you’ve all been supporting
 for the past four years will enter its fifth year.
 And so today, we’re changing our plans
 to present you with famous battle scenes
 in the order determined by votes from the guys in the Leaf!
 Is that favorite battle you want to see again included?
 We’ve also invited some special guests,
 so don’t miss it!
 Then, we’ll be moving on ahead.
 First, check out fifth and fourth place back to back!
 FIFTH PLACE NARUTO VS. SASUKE 		~LEAF HOSPITAL ROOF~
 All right, here we go, here we go, here we go!
 Just what you’d expect of me, the hero!
 To think I’d appear right at the start.
 I’ve shrewdly got everyone’s hearts!
 You’re right!
 To be honest,
 the coolness of Sasuke in motion is unfathomable.
 Outstanding destructive power. Cha!
 Umm, Sakura?
 Our comments aren’t meshing right off the bat.
 Just keep quiet!
 Right.
 Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Attack and defense with no time to breathe.
 This is gripping.
 Throw in a kick there!
 Give him a beat down and thrash up!
 Umm, Sakura. How about a little support for the hero there…?
 Shut up, Naruto!
 Naruto Barrage!
 Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
 Wh-What’s that Jutsu?!
 You jerk!
 Chidori!
 Stop it…you two…
 Stop it!
 That’s mean to punch me all of a sudden, Sakura!
 I couldn’t help it. I got excited.
 FOURTH PLACE CHOJI VS. JIROBO 		~FATSO VS. FATSO~ 		Now, let’s collect ourselves 		and check out fourth place next!
 It’s too late whatever you do now!
 Crushing Palm!
 Man, this battle moves me to tears, no matter how often I watch it.
 That’s right! As it happens,
 I sat down on my knees in front of the TV while blowing my nose.
 It invoked tears in the living rooms in the Land of Fire for sure.
 Yeah, yeah… I really thought Choji had died in this episode.
 That’s for sure.
 I was also totally fooled by the producers.
 Wh-What’s that…?
 But…
 Boulder Blow!
 It’s futile!
 I’m a hundred times stronger than before!
 They say a grudge over food is ferocious, right?
 That one punch just now
 was the grudge for you eating the last bite of the snack.
 No way! He’s got so much Chakra his build has changed!
 And this is…
 This is for insulting me by calling me a sacrificial piece and fat!
 But what’s most unforgivable is you insulting my best friend!
 That’s more unforgivable than swiping the last bite of gourmet food
 or insulting me by calling me fat!
 All my Chakra… to my left hand!
 O-Oh, no…!
 This one punch is heavier than life!
 W-Wait…! 					Don’t be hasty…!
 But seeing it again, visually it’s just fatso versus fatso.
 No appealing parts at all and the screen is stifling.
 I mean, no way would I want to see this during the summer
 Excuse me for being stifling.
 Yikes! Choji.
 How long were you there…?
 I heard my famous battle made it into the top five, you see…
 Oh wait, Choji.
 – You’ll understand once I tell you! – Calm down!
 Human Boulder! 97.01	01:57:15:03	01:57:16:07	I won!
 I actually…won!
 We had a bit of an incident here,
 but let’s not worry about that and move on.
 Now before we present third to first place,
 we’ll show the famous battles left out of the top five.
 Is the famous battle you chose included?
 Now then, here we go!
 EXTRA SEGMENT UNRANKED FAMOUS BATTLES
 KAKASHI VS. ZABUSA ~THE LAND OF WAVES ARC~
 – Rooster! 					– Rooster!
 – Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu! – Water Style: Water Dragon Jutsu!
 Sure enough, Kakashi Sensei’s Sharingan is super unfair!
 Just what you’d expect from a Jonin.
 KAKASHI VS. GAI ~ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS~
 – What?! 					– You’re late!
 – This is a famous battle?! – You’re seventeen minutes
 – Well, it’s cool to have stuff like this – and thirty two seconds late!
 – included once in a while, right? – Let’s forget about today…
 We both have forty eight wins!
 One of us will move ahead with this battle!
 It seems it won’t work even if I say no…
 This time it’s my turn to determine the battle category…
 What will it be? A Taijutsu fight?
 A 100-meter dash?
 Skin diving? I wouldn’t mind an eating contest…
 Listen, you…
 Well then…
 Wh-What?!
 Rock-paper-scissors!
 I accept the challenge. No way will I lose!
 If I lose, I’ll do five hundred laps
 around the Leaf Village standing on my head!
 Absurdity again…
 It’s a promise!
 Here we go again… His favorite own rules.
 Okay, everyone together now.
 – Rock-paper… 					– Rock-paper…
 Scissors!
 After the commercial, we’ll present third to first place.
 Don’t miss it.
 Now at last for the presentation of third to first place.
 First up is third place!
 Now then, which battle has worked its way up to the higher ranks?
 Here we go! The appearance of the famous team of Kiba and Akamaru!
 – Heh! 					– Damn it…
 – It’s the appearance of – Is it all over…?
 a team that’s just loud.
 What?! You’re saying to do that?!
 No, Akamaru!
 It’s too dangerous to do that without any comrades around!
 You understand that, don’t you?!
 We’ll die like dogs here if we miss…
 Ow!
 Akamaru…
 To think I’d get bitten by you. I’m a pathetic owner…
 Okay, Akamaru… As you say, we just have to do that…
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Now, Akamaru!
 What?!
 Show him the fruits of our training!
 Dynamic Marking!
 That’s a dirty trick!
 Now we’re ready!
 Inuzuka Style! Man-Beast Transformation Combo!
 Two-Headed Wolf!
 Eat this!
 Sakon, what’re you doing! To the right!
 Uh oh…!
 Wolf Fang Over Fang!
 Though he sometimes bites his owner’s hand,
 he presses for a decision.
 It seems Akamaru’s stock shot up in the Leaf after this.
 What a man!
 Man, my butt! Just a puppy whose evil eyes got worse!
 Who has evil eyes?!
 Yikes, Kiba!
 H-How long were you there…?
 Knock it off!
 Here I was invited as a guest
 with my battle having been ranked high.
 What’s the deal of finishing in third place
 on top of being told mean things?!
 It’s Kiba and Akamaru who finished in third.
 Please face the camera
 and say a few words to everyone in their living rooms.
 Oh, umm, thanks for your support.
 Well, we came in third this time.
 But we’ll kick the butts of some enemies,
 so please look forward to our success!
 Considering you’re talking all big or whatever,
 didn’t you have a rough time with it after this?
 The best is yet to come, I tell you!
 That’s the last straw. Get him, Akamaru!
 Now for the presentation of second place.
 He’s like a completely different person…
 His Chakra activity is overwhelming…
 And those markings…
 The movements earlier…
 He dodged the attack from behind
 and saw me hiding in the shadows…
 In other words, he’s combining wide vision and x-ray vision.
 And in addition, that Jutsu…
 Then…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 I’ll find a perfect… way to attack that power of yours.
 If he defends physical attacks with rotation
 and a large emission of Chakra…
 then I should stop that Chakra rotation!
 – This is the second place battle? – Scatter!
 That’s right! It’s a battle of brains while assessing the opponent’s weak point!
 Hmm. But as for me…
 I’m not a big fan of sluggish battles!
 – Oh, why? 					– Hmm.
 How can I put it? lf you’re talking about battle
 I want to see a collision of fist on fist, and body on body.
 Oh, but a Ninja isn’t just about Taijutsu.
 Oh. That’s being rude to Bushy Brow.
 Oh, sorry.
 I mean, yeah, I want to see
 something fiery, like Bushy Brow!
 There just isn’t anything fiery in Neji’s battles.
 Here!
 He’s argumentative or something.
 Unexciting or something.
 I’d like him to just take on the enemy without regard to appearances!
 Heh! Missions with you are a chore because you think like that.
 Yikes, Neji!
 Now then, a few words from the second place Neji.
 Humph! How silly.
 You’re free to evaluate my battles, but it’s unthinkable
 for me to be forced to appear in a place like this.
 Heh! You’re sure making an exhibition of yourself, considering!
 Oh! Could it be you’re after an appearance fee?!
 Too bad.
 This is a program for everyone in their living rooms,
 so we asked you to do this for free!
 No problem. I asked the Fifth Hokage
 and she’s treating this appearance as a mission.
 Since it’s a mission, I have no choice but to appear.
 And of course, a mission fee will be incurred.
 Whoa, always the realist.
 Neji, it’s not fair that you get paid for this!
 My brain is built differently than yours!
 Gentle Fist!
 It seems the ranking board is busted,
 so we’ll go right on ahead and present first place.
 Which battle has finished in first?
 Chidori!
 Oh ho! Sure enough, it’s pointless
 if the number one battle isn’t one of my battles!
 That’s right! This is the battle that
 anyone would acknowledge as number one.
 Rasengan!
 – Rasengan! 					– Chidori!
 And so, did you all guess right?
 The glorious best battle has been determined to be “Sasuke’s Battle!”
 Hey, hey, Sakura. lt’s the “Battle in the Final Valley”!
 FIRST PLACE NARUTO VS. SASUKE 		~FINAL VALLEY~ 		What? Was it?
 Forget it.
 Well, let’s collect ourselves and check out
 some special footage of myself, who came in a glorious first place!
 Y-You…idiot!
 Hold it! What’s up with this recording?!
 – This is different from what I prepared! – What’re you doing?!
 – No, no, don’t watch! – Don’t be peeping!
 I demand a do-over as the hero!
 Someone not involved is making a ruckus.
 And now, thanks for waiting!
 Now for the appearance of a special guest.
 Let’s go live to the site. Master Jiraiya!
 What? What?
 Master Jiraiya, can you hear me?
 Yes… Loud and clear.
 What?
 Master Jiraiya, where are you right now?
 Mm, I’m in kind of a dubious place.
 I hope you’ll excuse me from divulging my location.
 Well, if I have to say something,
 I’d say I’m in a certain person’s hideout, I guess.
 Hey! Pervy Sage! What’re you doing there?!
 What happened to you watching my training?!
 Now, now. Today’s a special program,
 so don’t be such a stick-in-the-mud.
 More importantly, I’ve met up with someone special…
 None other than Orochimaru.
 What?!
 Sakura… What the hell is this…?!
 It sure has been a long time, Orochimaru!
 Oh, same here…
 Here you could have invited me to the studio.
 Who would invite the likes of you?!
 Well, I have been busy collecting Jutsu and conducting experiments.
 And more importantly, I need him to get stronger quickly, so.
 – If he’s there, bring him out! – What…?!
 Actually, I tried talking him into it many times saying today’s special…
 But in the end, he didn’t give me a good answer.
 – I see… 					– Hey.
 What?!
 Are you going to go on and on forever?
 If you’ve got that kind of time, then continue the training, Orochimaru.
 S-Sasuke…
 Sasuke… ls that you, Sasuke?!
 I’ll be going on ahead to the dojo. Get a move on.
 Oh, wait…!
 Oh, it seems I’ve angered Sasuke.
 I shall also be leaving now.
 Wait! Orochimaru! Put Sasuke on one more time…
 Sakura… He can’t hear you anymore.
 I know…
 – Sakura… 					– Yeah. Right!
 That’s right!
 Now then, it’s about time to say goodbye.
 Did you all enjoy our special:

 Hey, what’re you wrapping things up on your own for?
 What about my do-over special footage?
 You’re annoying.
 We don’t have any time left, so wrap things up now!
 What?! Fine!
 Unfortunately, my special footage will have to wait for the next time.
 But everyone in the village, including me,

 when the stardust’s are rapidly dancing
 I just can’t come out and say, “Ah, I don’t want to go home yet.”
 Suggestively
 Spat at that beloved face!! Mister Cricket
 The Trombone gradually going off-key
 While on the sweaty center stage does bug me.
 But more importantly, the fuzziness I feel in my undeveloped chest,
 I wonder if it’s from that coke I just drank?
 I never thought that you were so stubborn!
 Even if you make a fuss, nothing's going to change.
 But, at this rate, she's going to abandon us.
 It's her choice. There's nothing we can do.
 Hey, Hinata! What do you think?
 We still don't know what her situation is…
 Does that mean that you're with Shino?!
 It's not like that!
 Hey, what are you fighting about?
 Naruto, Sensei is…
 Kurenai Sensei is going to quit!

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 No way…
 To think Old Man Hokage would try to eliminate Yakumo.
 No way could that ever happen!
 But if by some remote chance,
 Kurenai Sensei accepted such a mission…
 it would explain her strange behavior.
 No, no way! No way that could ever happen.
 Are you okay, Kurenai Sensei…?
 Yes. I feel quite a bit better now thanks to your first-aid…
 Who in the world is Kurenai Sensei protecting?
 It was the Third Hokage who told her to take custody of Yakumo…
 What in the world is her real mission…?
 What's going on?!
 Th-That's…
 Th-The Village Hidden in the Leaves is…
 No way…!
 Genjutsu or Reality?
 It’s like the aftermath of a large war that broke out.
 Hinata!
 Right…
 Byakugan!
 There’s not a person in the village…
 What is this…?
 What’s going on here?!
 Kiba, Hinata… ls there anything unusual in the area?
 No enemy signs anywhere…
 Akamaru doesn’t sense the scent of any outsiders, either.
 What happened in the village while we were away…?
 First, let’s take Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei to the hospital.
 We’ll check out the village after that…
 R-Right…!
 Leaf Hospital
 What’s this…?
 Anyway, let’s get these two to a hospital room…
 I’m okay. More importantly, take care of Yakumo.
 Right…
 You’re out of danger now…
 Oh, no…She’s unconscious!
 Her vital signs are weakening…
 I wonder if there’s any medicine left…
 Naruto, help me look…
 Oh, well, but…
 Just hurry!
 R-Right…
 There’s no scent of blood.
 Everyone must have evacuated somewhere.
 Let’s us check out the village.
 Right…
 Make sure you three always act together…
 Come back here in thirty minutes, no matter what.
 Right…
 What is it?
 Sure enough, you have to be the one to give us orders, Kurenai Sensei!
 What’s been the matter with you?!
 The pharmacy is that way.
 Nothing. I was just concerned about Kurenai Sensei…
 So let’s hurry and get the medicine!
 I mean, Kurenai Sensei’s going to… eliminate…Yakumo…
 Eliminate?
 Th-Th-That couldn’t be…
 I was just kind of out of it.
 Huh?
 Huh…? What was that?!
 What is it, Sakura?!
 There’s someone here other than us.
 What?!
 That’s close!
 I’ll leave the two in the hospital room to you, Sakura!
 I’m going after him!
 Got it!
 Hold it! Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Huh?! My Jutsu won’t activate?!
 Wait! This isn’t the time to be fighting.
 You guys are the ones who attacked the mountain cottage, right?!
 I am Unkai of the Kurama Clan…
 Kurama?! The same clan as Yakumo?!
 Why would her clan attack her?!
 Listen to me! lf you don’t, everyone will die!
 What's this smell of blood?!
 Byakugan!
 Close your Byakugan, Hinata!
 Kiba, restrain Akamaru’s sense of smell!
 –What?! 					–What is it?!
 It’s because we’re caught in someone’s Jutsu.
 Say what?!
 Yes. We’re now inside Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
 It may seem as if the Leaf Village was in a war.
 But this is merely a part of her Genjutsu.
 This whole Leaf Village is Genjutsu and we’ve all been trapped in it?
 That’s totally impossible!
 But if her latent powers have awakened, it wouldn’t be hard at all.
 This whole village?!
 This ground we’re standing on, this sky, everything is Genjutsu?!
 There are occasions when superior senses become a hindrance.
 It’s because no matter how superior the sense of sight or smell might be,
 ultimately it’s the human brain that processes and perceives the information!
 There are times when well-developed brains make errors
 in the process of interpreting complex electric signals.
 However, insects act only with sharp senses.
 Unlike the information processed with a human brain,
 insects narrow this information down to the very minimum.
 Look. My insects are still under control.
 They will not be deceived.
 There are occasions when
 Yakumo’s Genjutsu summons thunderclouds
 and produces fire.
 And that is planted directly into the human brain
 as if it had occurred in reality.
 And that causes the brain to hurt one’s own body.
 Then, Grandma’s house…
 That’s also Yakumo’s power?!
 It’s not just that…
 She can even kill people easily if she were so inclined.
 But these tremors…
 Are you saying this is also Genjutsu?
 You’ll see any moment now…
 A-A snake!
 It’s too huge!
 Is that also Genjutsu?!
 It’s a terrifying image that our cerebrums have created.
 Physical influence is absolutely…
 unthinkable!
 No way!
 Yakumo?! Kurenai Sensei?!
 Huh?!
 Really…? Yakumo can kill people with Genjutsu..?
 So is that why the Third Hokage tried to eliminate her?
 Yakumo, Yakumo?!
 Kurenai Sensei, Kurenai Sensei…
 Over here… Kurenai Sensei…
 I still can’t believe it.
 To think Yakumo would do something like that!
 Once every several generations,
 a child is born into our Kurama Clan with physical idiosyncrasies.
 That child is Yakumo…
 Moreover, what’s terrifying is her using her powers unconsciously
 without being able to control it.
 It’s getting kind of hot.
 Don’t!
 What’s happening outside the door…?
 Don’t open it!
 Wh-What’s this…?
 Why’s there lava here…?
 That’s an illusion our brains have created due to Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
 But even it’s an illusion, if we were to dive into the lava,
 our brains would determine it to be lava and our bodies would burn up.
 That is Yakumo’s power.
 So is that why Old Man Hokage and Kurenai Sensei
 tried to eliminate Yakumo?
 That’s not it.
 What they really attempted to kill
 was the monster existing inside Yakumo.
 A monster?
 Before too long, Yakumo’s massive powers
 created a terrifying monster.
 If left alone, the monster that continues to grow would
 someday attempt to become one with her
 by absorbing Yakumo’s consciousness.
 The Third Hokage and Kurenai determined as such
 and all there was to do in order to save Yakumo was to seal her powers.
 A monster in her body…
 So that’s what it was…
 I can’t just sit back like this!
 Oh!
 Oh. My entire fortune!
 I told you. If you dive into the lava, you’re body will really burn up.
 Then does that mean we can’t get out of here?!
 No, there is one way.
 What’s that way?!
 If you seal your five senses, the Genjutsu cannot affect the body.
 You must escape from this world and attack Yakumo!
 What?! Attack Yakumo?!
 Ow-ow-ow!
 What? This is…Satomi Hill?!
 Old Man Unkai!
 It seems you safely made it out of Yakumo’s Genjutsu…
 What the heck happened…?!
 At the point you brought Yakumo out of the mountain cottage,
 you were already caught in her Genjutsu.
 What?!
 Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!
 Kiba!
 Shino!
 Wh-Where are we…?
 Sakura, examine Old Man Unkai’s wounds.
 Unkai…?
 What happened?! These are awful burns!
 We were able to get out of Yakumo’s Genjutsu
 thanks to this old man!
 Rather, I’d say we were driven out…
 Her only target was Yuhi Kurenai, after all…
 Where’s Kurenai Sensei now?
 Well, probably…
 Yakumo…
 Kurenai Sensei… What do you think of my paintings…?
 Aren’t they wonderful?!
 What did you do to everyone?
 Don’t worry… I just drove out the intruders…
 Eventually, I must have my revenge on the Leaf Village…
 But first, I have some business with you, Sensei.
 Why include the Leaf Village as well…?
 I should be enough of a target for your revenge…!
 I won’t let you say you don’t know!
 How is it? 					Awesome, huh?
 I have complete control now of letting you live or killing you, Sensei.
 Tell me the truth…
 It was the Third Hokage who ordered my father and mother killed and
 the Kurama Clan and me eliminated from the Leaf Village, right?
 No.
 The Third Hokage did not order such a mission…
 Why do you lie?!
 Please.
 Tell me the truth!
 You’ll vanish if you don’t, Kurenai Sensei…
 Such a sad child…
 If killing me will eliminate your suffering, then you should do it.
 If your hate will vanish along with your suffering!
 Why do you cry? I won’t be deceived by tears like that!
 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005!
 Yeah, it feels good in every kind of weather to sweat.
 So the Kurama Clan are still here! Might Guy will take you on!
 W-Wait, Guy!
 Huh?! G-Guy?
 I see. So you guys were also caught in the Kurama Genjutsu…
 I’m sorry.
 Well, you’re alive and that’s all that matters.
 Thank goodness, thank goodness.
 Oh, you guys are back!
 Where are the village reinforcements?!
 There’s no time to explain!
 What?!
 Oh, hey! Wait, you guys!
 What’s up with them?!
 Who’s that man…? And what about everyone?
 Please, just help me out, Guy Sensei.
 But, well…
 Just hurry!
 R-Right…
 Byakugan!
 Those jerks…
 No, Yakumo!
 Yakumo and Kurenai Sensei are in the innermost room.
 All right!
 Hey, wait!
 Kiba!
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Everyone, what’s the current situation?
 Naruto hasn’t come back since he first went in.
 The insects had also detected something strange and emerged.
 Can you use your Byakugan to look inside?
 There’s some kind of powerful force that’s getting in the way.
 So all we can do is watch here?
 Does this mean that all we can do is believe in him and wait?

193,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I think we almost finished shaking off the losers.
 Then I guess I'll move onto the main issue.
 It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.
 All right!
 Here is the tenth question!
 Here it comes!
 I have to put everything on the line for this question!
 The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!
 Hmph! Making such a big deal.
 This is the final obstacle.
 Kankuro, come back already!
 If he starts the tenth question, your cheat sheet has no meaning!
 But before that,
 I'm going to add some rules for the last question.
 Aren't you lucky?
 It looks like playing with the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?
 This guy.
 He's figured Crow out!
 Anyway, sit down.
 Let me explain!
 These are
 the hopeless rules!
 Well, anyhow.
 There's nothing to do when the subordinates are gone, huh?
 Well, it'll get busy soon enough.
 Why?
 This year's first proctor...
 I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.
 Well then, passing the first exam already seems iffy.
 Of all the people, that sadist...
 Sadist?
 Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,  so you wouldn't know.
 Who is this person?
 He is a pro, a professional.
 Professional? Of what?
 Torture and interrogation.
 What?!
 Well, there maybe no physical torture in the exam itself,
 but he's sure to use his his skills as an interrogator
 to torment them psychologically.
 That is...
 Leaf Village Anbu's Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,
 Ibiki Morino!
 Hopeless rules...?!
 First, you guys will have to choose
 whether or not you will take this 10th question!
 Huh?!
 Choose whether or not to take the exam?
 What, choose?!
 What happens if you choose not to take the 10th exam?
 If you chose not to take the exam, then your score will be zero.
 In other words, you fail!
 And of course, the same goes for the two others in the same group!
 W-What does that mean!
 Of course, everybody is going to choose to take the exam!
 This is ridiculous! As if we have a choice!
 And... one more rule...
 Another one?!
 Finish with it already!
 If you chose to take it and are unable to answer it correctly,
 then you will have to...
 relinquish your right of taking the Chunin Exam forever.
 What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!
 Besides, there are plenty of people here
 who have taken the Chunin Exam many times!
 You're just unlucky.
 I make the rule this year.
 But I did give you the option to go back!
 For those of you who aren't confident, you can choose not to take it
 and take the exam next year or the year after that.
 Oh! How terrible!
 If one out of the three chooses not to take the exam,
 then all three will be failed.
 If you do choose to take it, but get the wrong answer...
 then that person will be a Genin for the rest of their life!
 No matter what, the odds are against us!
 It's an impossible choice for anyone with normal nerves!
 Then, let's begin...
 The 10th question…
 Those who will not be taking it, raise your hands!
 Once I confirm your number, I'll ask you to leave!
 What kind of a question is it going to be….?
 Darn!
 If I get it wrong, I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.
 I don't want that!
 But if I choose not take it...!
 then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too! I don't want that either!
 I won't raise my hand!
 I'm confident that I can answer it correctly.
 But…
 But Naruto! You're different!
 You should retreat this time even if it means to ignore us
 and think of your next chance to take the Exam!
 I... I...
 I'm quitting! I'm not going to take it!
 #50 failed!
 # 130, #111 will be failed as well...
 I-I'm sorry... Gennai! Inaho!
 Darn...
 M-Me too!
 Me too!
 Naruto...
 Why don't you raise your hand?
 That guy...
 I am the super elite ninja
 who will be carrying the name of the Hokage!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki, remember that!
 Shut up!
 I'm prepared to do anything to become a Hokage!
 I will surpass the Hokage!
 And I will make all of the people in the village
 acknowledge my presence!
 He's always got such a one-track mind.
 Saying Hokage, Hokage all the time like a fool.
 I'm sorry, Naruto.
 It seems like...
 I don't want to...
 crush your unachievable dreams.
 That guy...
 Ibiki completely understands how the human psyche works.
 And the most horrifying part is...
 that by cornering people psychologically he controls their psyche and
 reveals the fundamental weakness of a human.
 Don't underestimate me! I won't run!
 I'll take it!
 But even if I'm stuck being a Genin forever,
 I will  become a Hokage no matter what it takes!
 I'm not scared!
 That guy, he wasn't even thinking of us at all.
 Such audacity!
 That's right…
 That's exactly the kind of fool you are!
 I'll ask again.
 It's a choice that will alter your life.
 If you want to quit, now is your chance!
 I'm not going to take back my words!
 That is my Way of Ninja!
 Huh... What a funny kid.
 He completely brushed away those kids' anxieties.
 78, huh? Much more left than I expected.
 It's going to be the same. No matter how much more I push it.
 I like your determination!
 Then...
 For those who are still here...
 The first exam...
 You have passed it!
 Huh?
 H-Hey, what does that mean?
 All of a sudden you're telling us that we've passed!
 What about the 10th question?
 There wasn't such a thing to begin with!
 Well, you can look at the choice you just had to make as the 10th question!
 What?!
 Hey!
 Then, what were all those nine questions for!
 It was just a waste of time!
 Not a waste...
 The objective of the nine questions were already accomplished.
 To test your individual ability to gather information!
 Ability to gather information?
 First…
 The focus of this test was
 on the system of determining the pass or failure
 based on the three-person groups that was proposed in the first rule.
 By grading the exam on a group basis,
 I added the unimaginable pressure of dragging down your teammates.
 I see, I see.
 I kind of felt that was the point of this test!
 No , you didn't!
 However...
 The questions on these tests weren't things that
 you Genin Ninja would have been able to solve...
 So in that case…
 I imagined that most of you here would have come to this conclusion:
 ""In order to score points, I'll have to cheat.""
 In other words,
 this exam was created under the premise that you all would cheat!
 That being said,
 I had two Chunin in the group who knew all of the answers
 from whom you could cheat.
 What?! That's what it was?
 I had a hard time figuring out the guy.
 Yeah. Really...
 It was so obvious!
 There's something wrong with you if you didn't notice!
 Right, Hinata?!
 He... didn't realize it...
 However...
 those who just foolishly cheated, naturally were disqualified.
 That's because...
 Information, depending on the time and situation,
 it will be more valuable than life.
 And in a mission or on a battlefield,
 you will always have to risk your life to fight for it!
 Horrible burn marks, nail punctures and scratches...
 Those are signs of physical torture!
 When information is gathered
 and the enemy or a third party finds out about it,
 that information is no longer guaranteed to be correct.
 Just remember this.
 To be given the wrong information
 can bring a catastrophic blow to your friends and town.
 So that is why, out of necessity, we forced you guys to cheat
 in order to test your ability to collect information.
 And we filtered out those who were clearly lacking in those abilities.
 But...
 The last question doesn't make any sense.
 However...
 this 10th question was the main issue of this first exam.
 Huh?
 What do you mean?
 I'll explain.
 The tenth question was to take on the question, or not.
 Needless to say, it is a painful decision to make.
 Those who chose not to take on the question,
 would be immediately failed along with their whole squad!
 Those who chose to answer the question and got it wrong…
 would be robbed of their chance to take the Exam forever.
 It really is an unfair question.
 Then, how about these two choices?
 Let's say that you guys did become a Chunin.
 The mission is to steal a secret document!
 You have no idea how many Ninjas the enemy has,
 their ability, and other armament they may have.
 On top of that, there maybe the pitfall of an enemy trap.
 Now this mission... Will you take it? Or not take it?
 Because you want your life spared...
 Because your partners will be put in danger...
 Can you get away from dangerous missions?
 The answer is...
 No!
 There are going to be missions you cannot avoid
 no matter how risky or dangerous it may be!
 Showing your courage to your teammates in a tight spot,
 and the ability to get through the hardships...
 This is the quality that is needed in a Chunin troop leader!
 In a pinch, there are those who cannot risk their own fate,
 and those who waver and give up their chances
 because they think they will have another chance.
 I believe that such fools who don't have strong determination
 have no right to become a Chunin!
 For those of you who chose to take on the question,
 you can say that you have successfully answered the difficult 10th question!
 You shall be able to take on the adversity that may lie in your way.
 You've passed through the gates!
 The fist exam for the Chunin Exam has been completed.
 I wish you well!
 All right! Wish us well!
 I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah!
 What a funny guy...
 W-What's going on?!
 Gosh, this one...
 You guys!
 This isn't the time to be celebrating!
 I'm the proctor for the second exam! Anko Mitarashi!
 Let's move onto the next stage! Next!
 Follow me!
 Read the atmosphere.
 This proctor... ls kind of like Naruto.
 78?! Ibiki! You let 26 teams slide by?
 I guess, the first exam this time around was too easy.
 It seems like this time, there are a lot of excellent candidates.
 Huh! Well, all right...
 I'll drop more than half of them in the second exam!
 M-More than half?
 I'm getting excited.
 I'll give you the details tomorrow.
 We'll be changing locations,
 so get information from your Jonin about the location and the time!
 That's it. You're dismissed.
 I didn't think that there would be a guy that would pass with a blank sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki... He really is a funny guy.
 W-What is this place?!
 NO TRESPASSING
 This is the location for the ""second exam"",
 the 44th Training Field.
 Also known as... the Forest of Death.
 The Forest of... Death?!
 I passed the first exam!
 I'm just going to hop, jump and take a big step and...
 Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?
 Hey, you guys!
 if you want to play a Ninja game...
 No? What? You came here for a mission?!

194,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
 At this point in time,
 I don’t even plan to fight over Sasuke with you.
 Sakura!
 Do you know who you’re lipping off to?!
 Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
 It seems like... it seems like Sakura was out of line!
 Ino’s eyes show incredible anger. She’s scary.
 Hmm.
 That's not it…
 Huh?
 Sakura’s not the kind of kid to do things
 like needlessly flaunt her own power and hurt people.
 She doesn’t like having Ino taking pity on her and pulling punches.
 – This time for sure, – This time for sure,
 – with full strength, – with full strength,
 – a fair... fight! – a fair... fight!
 The Ultimate Battle: Cha!
 Just a Clone Jutsu…?!
 This isn’t a Ninja Academy’s graduation exam!
 You think you can beat me…
 with a textbook ninja art?!
 If I look carefully, I can find out, which is the real one right away…
 Chakra to my feet at a burst…Then…
 repel off the ground!
 Fast!
 If you think I’m the crybaby Sakura I was until recently,
 you’ll get your fingers burned!
 Come like you mean it, Ino!
 I appreciate you saying that…
 I’ll go like I mean it, as you wish!
 Way to go Sakura!
 Great!
 Really great!
 With the fundamental movements using Chakra,
 she’s topnotch among the rookies…
 Huh?
 Sakura is at her best.
 That means… ls she better than me?
 Well!
 That’s right.
 Awww!
 Sending Chakra all throughout the body and
 using the technique with it at a right timing…
 Those techniques alone are better than Sasuke.
 Well, from the start, she was extremely good at…
 controlling her Chakra, so…
 Magnificent movements, Sakura!
 However, her opponent is good too.
 This evenly-matched battle looks to take awhile!
 Since when did this girl get this strong?!
 I can make it, too…!
 You little…!
 Whoa!
 At this rate, it’ll never end.
 This is long…
 They’ve been going at it for ten minutes, at the least.
 You shouldn’t be evenly matched with me!
 What makes you think I’m evenly matched with you…
 who’s only concerned with looks and growing your hair frivolously?!
 You!
 You carry your mocking of me too far!
 Idiot.
 She’s going for the bait.
 Who knows what Ino will do!
 I don’t like Ino when she’s that way…!
 You’re simple-minded…
 Uh-oh.
 She’s totally lost it!
 I don’t need this!
 S-Scary…
 I’ll put an end to this right now!
 I’ll make you say that you lost!
 Hey, don’t tell me…
 Could it be…?
 As I recall, that Sign is…
 I knew it…
 She’s planning to do the Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Man…That idiot!
 I understand your feelings of frustration, but that’s futile.
 Humph!
 I wonder!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu…
 A Jutsu where the user can take over the opponent’s spirit
 and wrest their body away for a few minutes…
 by discharging all of their own spiritual energy
 and striking the enemy with it.
 But, there are major flaws to this formidable Jutsu.
 First, the discharged spiritual energy can only fly straight and at a slow speed.
 Second, even in the case of failing to hit the enemy and missing,
 the user can’t return to her own body for several minutes.
 I should add that during that interval, the user’s,
 in other words, your main body will turn into a doll that won’t move at all!
 In the first place,
 the Mind Transfer Jutsu is used for spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.
 Ino, using that Jutsu here would be equal to suicide…
 It shouldn’t be particularly scary if she moves about…
 And not only that, if she dodges the Jutsu,
 she can beat the heck out of the non-moving opponent.
 If that happens, Hayate will be forced to put an end to the match…
 So what?!
 I won’t know unless I try!
 If you miss, it’s over.
 You know that, right?
 In the first place, it’s a combination Jutsu to be used
 after stopping the opponent’s movements during a battle
 with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 There’s no way!
 There is no way, it will hit…
 Idiot! Stop!
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Which one…?
 That was unfortunate…
 Ino.
 Has the fat lady sung…?
 She went and did it…
 Then, it’s over, eh.
 This is…?!
 You fell for it, Sakura!
 I finally caught you!
 It can't be!
 Yes, it can.
 My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,
 to drive you who was running about into this contrivance.
 So?
 You can’t move at all, can you?
 It’s special rope that’s my hair with Chakra poured in!
 With this, it will be over when I enter your body and say “give up!”
 It wouldn’t miss a hundred percent of the time!
 I see…
 That idiot… Her losing it was also an act?
 Get out of there, Sakura!
 I can’t move…!
 Then…
 Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 That was unfortunate…
 She missed!
 No!
 Sakura…
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 W-What’s with Ino?
 Also... Sakura’s acting kind of strange! Believe it!
 But…surely this is her chance!
 Do it, Sakura!
 It’s no use.
 To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there…
 Sakura’s had it.
 Mind Transfer…?!
 That means Sakura right now is…
 Yes.
 Sakura’s spirit has been completely taken over by Ino.
 What?!
 Ino is inside of Sakura’s body now!
 Well.
 Ino’s purpose is most likely…
 With this, it’s over.
 Good bye, Sakura…
 I…Sakura Haruno concede…
 – this match… 					– No!
 Sakura!
 Tsk!
 He’s annoying!
 You did your hardest to get here!
 You’ll disgrace women if you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
 Like I said, those words are useless…
 What's...
 this bad chill…?!
 Naruto is annoying!
 Anyway, that’s right… not to Ino I won’t …
 Sakura?!
 This can’t be happening…
 What’s the matter?
 Are you conceding?
 I won’t be conceding!
 No Way!
 Cha!
 Which is it?
 W-What’s going on?!
 Sakura…?!
 No way!
 I messed up my Jutsu…?
 Ino…You’ll have a terrible time of it if you don’t get out of me quick!
 What’s wrong, with Ino?
 No… I won’t hold on at this rate…
 Release!
 It can’t be… She shattered Ino’s Jutsu!
 She used too much energy before the Jutsu…
 So she didn’t have enough Chakra…?!
 To think she has two spirits… What are you?!
 Strength that ranks with beauty.
 Girls can’t survive if they’re not tough!
 If caught in that spell,
 it’s not that easy to cast out the invader…
 Ino’s lack of Chakra…
 There’s also that…
 But what was more effective  than that…
 was the combative spirit towards lno she has inside her heart.
 So that was awakened with Naruto’s voice as the trigger and she cast Ino out…?
 There’s nothing to it.
 Like Naruto…
 Sakura’s fighting spirit was much stronger than others.
 – This is…! 					– This is…!
 But, both of them should have hardly any Chakra left.
 – This is… 					– This is…
 – the end! 					– the end!
 Both parties are unable to continue the match!
 By double knockout,
 no one gets through the fourth battle of the preliminary!
 – What?! 					– Huh?!
 Now then...
 Good grief.
 Hey, Ino!
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 A-A-Are you okay?!
 Treatment’s not necessary.
 They’ll probably wake up after awhile.
 But, that was surprising…
 Yeah…
 Naruto and Sasuke aside…
 to think even that Sakura who didn’t have what it took has grown this much…
 A lot happened,
 but I really feel like it was a good thing…
 sending her to this Chunin Exam.
 Tenten vs. Temari
 Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
 Now…
 The second one from the Land of Sand, huh…
 – This looks to be an interesting match. – Do your best, Tenten!
 It looks like you finally woke up, eh…Sakura.
 Huh?!
 Tenten, power of youth!
 Go Go!
 There is no limit to your youth!
 Our match is already over.
 Did I…lose?
 I’m the one who wants to cry…
 To think I tied with somebody like you…
 Huh?
 Here!
 You also got a flower to bloom, didn’t you?
 A beautiful flower!
 Ino…
 However...
 the next time we fight,
 it won’t end with you getting knocked out!
 Hm…?!
 And… I won’t hand over Sasuke to you!
 I return the same line to you!
 – Humph! 					– Humph!
 The fifth battle…
 Tenten, Temari… come forward!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 You know! You know!
 I feel like women battles are incredible, or…
 Women are scary.
 Huh?
 Hey-hey!
 This isn’t the time to be withdrawing, Shikamaru.
 You’re kind of a plain, or a lousy, or an unimpressive guy, aren’t you?
 If you don’t really put your whole heart into it, things will get hairy for you.

 to have lookout duty on a day like this.
 I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.
 Stop fussing.
 The Chunin Exam takes place twice a year.
 You’ll have many more chances to see it.
 But this year, that kid from the Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?
 And I won’t have a chance to see that…
 I won’t be able to die peacefully.
 What’s that?!
 It’s time! Begin!
 The Summoning has succeeded.
 Huge boa!
 Notify Lord Hokage immediately!
 I’m not letting you in the village!
 Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!
 Yes sir!
 Sand Ninja!
 What’s going on?
 Stop that, Gaara!
 I’ll kill him…!
 There’s no meaning in continuing this fight!
 Don’t forget our mission!
 Out of my way…!
 What are you guys doing?!
 The operation is already underway!
 What in the world is going on?
 Gaara!
 What’s the matter?!
 His wound is deeper than I thought!
 And moreover his Chakra is pretty drained!
 In that case, what about using that thing…?
 That’s impossible to do right away!
 Idiot! It’s all because you didn’t wait for the signal
 and tried to become the Perfect Possession…
 What should we do?!
 Are you saying we have to do this without Gaara?
 Isn’t Gaara here yet?!
 Gaara is Sand’s trump card.
 We have to get Gaara to do his work, no matter what!
 You guys leave for the moment and tend to Gaara’s wounds!
 As soon as Gaara’s Chakra has been restored…
 the operation will recommence!
 Got it!
 What about you, Sensei?!
 I’m gonna suppress those guys!
 Do you think things will go according to your plan?
 I’ll make them so…
 Go!
 Okay!
 Is Orochimaru the host of this party?
 Dunno… In any case, let’s heat this thing up.
 Sasuke…
 Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.
 You’ve already achieved Chunin level.
 If you’re a Leaf Shinobi, be of service to the Leaf!
 In other words, I’m supposed to take down that jerk Gaara, right?
 A continuation of earlier on, right?
 Don’t pursue too far.
 From here on, it’s no longer an exam. lt’s the real thing!
 What I have to do though… is the same!
 I won’t let him through!
 Sasuke…!
 Boy oh boy…
 We intended to take Sasuke while Gaara was causing the trouble.
 But not everything goes as planned.
 I see… Is that so?
 So Leaf Village and… Sasuke were the target, huh?
 Is the Leaf such a big catch?
 More importantly, if Gaara wakes up,
 I’ll be able to show you something much more interesting.
 Well, anyway…
 Your thick-headedness has caused the Leaf to be outmaneuvered.
 It’s my win.
 Nothing is decided until the very end.
 I believe that’s what I taught you…
 Orochimaru.
 I thought this day would eventually arrive.
 However…
 You won’t get my head that easily!
 I told you, didn’t I?
 It is preferable to decide the Fifth Hokage quickly…
 Third Hokage…
 because you will…die here.
 I wonder how the Chunin Exams are going?
 I wonder if Naruto’s match is over yet?
 The first match was with Neji, right?
 I want him to win that match somehow or other.
 That’s no good!
 A teacher mustn’t root for one particular student!
 All the graduating students are dear to him!
 I must root for all of them equally!
 But I still…want Naruto to win…
 Are you worried about Naruto?
 Well, of course…!
 As I thought…
 Y-You guys…
 I told you to do ten laps around the school grounds, didn’t I?!
 We finished that long ago.
 While you were daydreaming, Sensei.
 When our teacher is in that state, he can’t teach a class!
 So let’s call it quits for today!
 N-No, no! I’m continuing with class.
 I wonder what that smoke is…?
 That’s coming from the direction of the exam arena…
 Isn’t there some disturbance to the east?
 I wonder if something happened?
 That Orochimaru…
 What should we do?
 Should we send reinforcements?
 No… It’s dangerous to make a move when we don't really know
 what the situation is.
 If the mastermind is Orochimaru…
 even more so.
 Is Orochimaru… that dangerous a guy?
 Originally…he was a student of the Third Hokage.
 So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?
 Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage was decided…
 Orochimaru apparently asserted that he was capable of taking on that role.
 But his request was denied.
 And shortly afterwards, that guy slipped out of this village.
 Orochimaru most likely holds a grudge against
 the Third Hokage because of that.
 Revenge…is it?
 Probably.
 Long ago, when I was a kid…
 there’s one thing I remember thinking when I saw that guy…
 That he didn’t seem human…
 That he seems to be something that just took on a human form…
 Frightening…
 Simply…frightening.
 Reporting!
 A large boa has appeared near the eastern gate of the Leaf Village!
 And behind it, some one hundred Sand Ninja are infiltrating the country!
 They are currently engaged in armed conflict with our Shinobi
 who were patrolling nearby!
 The Sand…?!
 Leave Squad One and Two behind and make for the eastern gate.
 Immediately!
 – Yes sir! 					– Yes sir!
 We won’t let you past this point!
 There’s quite a large number.
 We were careless!
 And even Lord Hokage has been…
 Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!
 Yeah.
 What…?
 Orochimaru!
 Orochimaru?!
 Why is that guy…?
 Don’t tell me that they’re after Sasuke again?!
 Sasuke!
 Huh?
 He’s not there…?
 Sakura, stay there for a while.
 I’m gonna go reduce the number of enemies.
 Darn! I’m worried about Lord Hokage, but…
 Leave above to Anbu.
 Besides…
 Lord Hokage isn’t the kind of guy who can be taken down that easily.
 But…
 After all, he is the Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
 Are you so happy, you’re crying?
 Or…
 do you have an iota of sadness in your heart to kill me, your teacher?
 No…
 Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy…
 but I’m finally awake.
 That’s what I thought.
 I know you aren’t someone who would hold a grudge.
 You have neither a goal nor motive.
 Hmm… I guess…
 I do kind of have a goal.
 If I were to explain it…
 It’s interesting to watch things that move.
 I get no pleasure if something doesn’t move.
 Like a windmill that doesn’t turn…
 Well, it may have some kind of appeal once in a while.
 But usually, it’s not worth looking at it.
 Right now…with a wind called “Destroy the Leaf Village,”
 I want to turn that windmill.
 You’re the same as always…
 Sakura!
 It was worth teaching you Genjutsu survival training
 during the Genin Exam.
 You truly have a talent for it.
 Huh?
 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
 Naruto will be delighted.
 He’ll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be careful…
 It’s the first A-ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong 264.01	02:38:02:02	02:38:05:10	Yes! I've been waiting for this!
 Finally, it’s the first A-Ranked mission in a while!
 Listen, Sakura and Shikamaru!
 As long as I’m with you, it will be an easy one.
 I’m the super hero who can wake a sleeping lion.
 Just keep watching Mr. Naruto’s stellar performance!
 Next time: “Village in Distress: A New A-Ranked Mission!”
 Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

196,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I'm going...
 to become the Hokage.
 I can’t lose here!
 You? Hokage?!
 When you’re weaker than me?
 I’ll become... Hokage for you!
 Transform!
 Hey hey, are you serious?
 You’ve been here three years
 and you can’t even do a respectable transformation?!
 All of you watch now!
 I will absolutely someday become the true and a real Hokage!
 Lame! What Hokage?!
 You know deep down inside that you can’t become the Hokage.
 So quit acting tough!
 You’re wrong Kiba…
 If you compete with me for the name of Hokage…
 You... will be the loser!
 Surprise Attack! Naruto's Surprise Weapon!
 Man! Same thing over and over again. You're pesky!
 Well, never mind.
 I’ll just make it so you won’t stand up again!
 Let’s go, Akamaru!
 You think you can get me with that same technique again?!
 Take this!
 Darn!
 Fang Over Fang!
 This Jutsu…
 Though, I’ve seen it before…
 it’s not a Jutsu you can dodge over and over!
 What do I do?
 What should I do?!
 Looks like you’ve got nothing left.
 I’ve got plenty left!
 Even if you increased yourself by three or four, I’d still have a lot left!
 You’ve got a comeback for everything!
 Let’s finish him with the next! Akamaru!
 Darn!
 I have to counterattack somehow.
 Even if I do, it has to get Kiba or there’s no point!
 But which is which…?
 W-What will you do? Naruto!
 Naruto…
 T-That’s it!
 Transform!
 You’re mine!
 I see how it is…
 Huh?
 There, look closely.
 Oh!
 You did it!
 That’s a clever move, Naruto!
 Naruto!
 If he transforms into Kiba,
 the real Kiba doesn’t know which is Akamaru and which is Naruto…
 He can’t attack carelessly.
 However, it’s okay for Naruto to attack either one!
 Oooh!
 He created a chance opening…
 Good work!
 I see, so that’s your move…
 But…
 I’ll give you a piece of advice!
 I was careless before and a little late to realize it…
 But the Transformation Jutsu isn’t effective anymore!
 Why, you ask?
 Yeah!
 I can smell you.
 Don’t mess with our sense of smell, Naruto.
 By concentrating his Chakra into his nose,
 Kiba’s sense of smell is enhanced tens of thousands times more than average.
 Of course, he can determine people by their smell too.
 Heh, I won!
 W-What?!
 What's going on?!
 Kiba’s nose got Naruto and Akamaru mixed up?
 Darn! What in the world is going on…?!
 Then you’re Naruto!
 Messing with me!
 What?!
 Well, this is coming from the original prankster, after all…
 He’s had it!
 He did it!
 Naruto… Awesome!
 Darn it!
 So that’s it…
 Naruto, transformed into Kiba,
 was discovered by the real Kiba with smell and hit…
 But Naruto didn’t come back in true Naruto form.
 Instead, he transformed into Akamaru instantly!
 In order to make it look as if it was Akamaru who was hit
 and his impersonation transformation dissolved!
 Was Naruto ever that smart…?
 You little…!
 Think hard about your Jutsu before you use them!
 Because they’ll be used against you, stupid!
 He’s using my line, word to word…
 Arguing with this guy is only a waste of time!
 Don’t go at Naruto’s pace…
 Calm down.
 Calm down!
 He can’t actually keep up with my movements yet…
 I still have the advantage!
 Look closely at Naruto’s movements and if there’s an opening…
 I can surely take him from behind with the All-Four Jutsu.
 Nothing to get flustered about…
 If I do this in a level-headed manner, it’s a match I will most certainly win!
 Evidently your enemy has become calm…
 Well, what will you do, Naruto…?
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... I’ll end this…
 with my new special technique I’ve been saving up!
 So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?
 Well then... I’ll end this…
 with my new special technique I’ve been saving up!
 What?!
 New special trick?!
 Huh? When did he…?!
 Leave it to Naruto to hide a new technique!
 What new special technique!
 That’s obviously a bluff!
 You can test out whether it’s a bluff or not!
 This hasn’t changed since before…
 Don’t let his pace get to you.
 Calm down!
 Let’s go!
 I don’t know what kind of technique this is but…!
 I just won’t let you do it!
 Now!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry… All-Four Jutsu!
 Q-Quick…
 Why are you stopping?!
 Naruto!
 Naruto!
 Just as I thought, this is as far as he will go.
 Stand up! Naruto!
 D-Darn! I don’t even have time to work up my Chakra!
 Hey hey! What’s wrong?!
 Naruto!
 He’s fast!
 It’s no good.
 He doesn’t have time to form hand Signs!
 There’s too much of a difference in their strength…
 It’s impossible for Naruto, after all.
 Naruto…
 D-Darn!
 Take this!
 What?!
 Take that!
 I’m going to be Hokage!
 I won’t lose here!
 Whatever! You can’t keep up with my speed at all!
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
 Naruto!
 This is what it’s like when I really let it out.
 You understand, don’t you?
 To me, you’re merely…!
 I...
 Huh?
 will absolutely not lose!
 That Naruto… He’s a fighter.
 Yup.
 If I were Kiba, I’d be sick of this already.
 It doesn’t matter which anymore, I just wish they’d settle it quickly.
 Naruto...
 Fight!
 Naruto! Use the new technique or whatever!
 Just settle it!
 Naruto! Go for it!
 I have to find some opening in that darn Kiba…
 You’ve got absolutely no effect on me!
 You’ve got spirit, I’ll give you that!
 He’s close at his end…
 I’ll settle it with the next one!
 I’ll make the new technique explode no matter what!
 I won’t let you!
 You’re slow!
 Take this!
 Oops!
 Fast movements and a keen nose…
 The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry turned out to be harmful…
 Right now Kiba’s sense of smell is tens of thousands times
 more powerful than normal…
 Well…
 That fart was probably a freak accident, but…
 That’s what you’d expect from the number one unpredictable Ninja.
 Naruto!
 Now’s your chance!
 Darn! I was straining too much…
 But now’s the time to show my new technique!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto!
 Okay! The way you’ve torn me apart up until now,
 I’ll give it back all at once!
 D-Darn it!
 U-!
 Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
 Naruto... Barrage!
 A new technique, eh?
 Well, he was watching Sasuke’s technique a moment ago…
 Lion Barrage!
 For the record, the name is a rip off, too.
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one!
 You did it!
 That Naruto beat Kiba!
 It’s a major upset…
 Yup!
 Yes!
 I’m…getting stronger!
 That was easy!
 W-What to do?
 What should I do…?
 N-Naruto...
 Huh? Hinata?
 Did you say something?
 Ah, ah, ah… 					Umm…
 Huh?
 Hinata…?
 What's this?
 It’s an ointment.
 Why for me?
 Take it for her, Naruto.
 Hmmm. Okay!
 Thank you! You’re nice, Hinata!
 Kiba, it’s nothing to be embarrassed about …
 This kid was a really strong opponent.
 You are taking this pretty easy, aren’t you, Lady Hinata…?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 What’s with that guy!
 Calling people failure and judging them!
 Blah blah blah blah blah blah! Talking like a wise guy!
 I’m in a bad mood!
 Hinata, you say something!
 Get that guy!
 Show that guy that people can really change!

 The distance created between us became too big,
 because we were always together
 Your honest reply, “See you…”
 coming from that brash mouth makes it sadder.
 If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying
 Then I want to deliver you a smile, even if I’m not by your side
 Fly into the wavy and twisted sky, into your hands
 I can feel it so close,
 Our two hearts
 Sure enough, I just can’t get into training by myself.
 As for the Pervy Sage…
 I wonder what he’s doing and where?
 And what happened to him watching my training?! Damn it!
 What’s she doing?
 Wow, are you painting a picture?
 Huh?!
 There’s nothing like rain clouds in the sky.
 Wha--?
 The Hokage’s house!
 Hurry! Get a move on.
 Water, water, water!
 Right away!
 – Water Style! – Water Style!
 – Marine Battle Formation Jutsu! – Marine Battle Formation Jutsu!
 Whoa! You idiots. Not me, up on the roof!
 We’re very sorry!
 Right, keep it up.
 Yes, ma’am!
 As I thought, the thing I had feared has happened…
 Kurenai's Decision: Squad 8 Left Behind
 There she is.
 Hey! Wait up!
 Giving us trouble.
 Let’s hurry up and take her back.
 Right.
 Hey, wait!
 What’re you guys doing?!
 Anbu Black Ops?!
 Naruto Uzumaki, leave this place immediately.
 Huh?!
 As for her, what’d she do?
 It doesn’t concern you.
 Listen up. Don’t breathe a word of what you saw here.
 Knock it off! Just a minute!
 Don’t get in our way!
 Oh! They vanished…
 Damn it! What’s going on?!
 Oh, important documents are soaked.
 This will have to be dried in the sun.
 I’ll take them outside.
 Thanks.
 ‘Morning.
 Oh, Kurenai Sensei.
 Is the Fifth Hokage in?
 Yes.
 So? Is there no change to your sentiment about pulling out of Squad 8?
 No.
 Think about it carefully.
 Kiba, Shino, Hinata…
 You’re the one who recommended those guys lacking in experience
 for the Chunin Exam.
 You don’t care about them?
 But I must not leave that problem unresolved.
 It’s my responsibility, so…
 That incident was no fault of yours.
 If the Anbu Black Ops are involved, then is she a considerably bad person?
 Or was she involved in some kind of significant incident?
 What did you say?!
 Calm down, Kiba.
 Kiba, Hinata?
 Hey, Shino. Say that again!
 Very well. I said it’d be futile.
 How dare you say something like that…!
 Cut it out!
 Naruto.
 Calm down. What the hell’s wrong?
 We in Squad 8 were left high and dry by Kurenai Sensei.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 You see, Sensei spoke to us directly about it.
 My duty is completed.
 You will probably be provided with another Jonin in charge eventually.
 Just a minute, Kurenai Sensei.
 Sensei…
 It’s written in stone.
 Our relationship is just that of commander and subordinate.
 It’s just the team formation changing as circumstances demand.
 And that was that. She didn’t even give us a reason.
 That was that? Are you guys going to accept that?
 Hell no! That’s why I’m saying we should march into the Hokage’s office and
 protest why she is removing Kurenai Sensei from our Squad 8!
 Then this Shino says…
 I’m saying it’s futile.
 It’s because this might be something she herself decided on.
 Pig-headed jerk…!
 Hinata, what do you think?
 I also want Kurenai Sensei to stay as our Jonin in charge…
 But…
 But what?!
 Kurenai Sensei might have some kind of reason of her own…
 Umm…
 So you’re the same as Shino, huh?
 No… Kiba!
 Just stop fighting already. I’ll do something about this.
 Naruto, you’re not even on this team.
 What’re you going to do?
 Leave it to me.
 I won’t let Kurenai Sensei quit, no matter what.
 I blurted out that they can leave it to me, but I don’t know.
 Hm?
 Kurenai Sensei.
 What’s she doing?
 All right, I should ask her directly.
 Umm, Sensei.
 Naruto.
 I heard from Kiba and the others.
 What?
 Don’t give up being in charge of Squad 8.
 They’re really depressed.
 That’s why you went to the trouble of coming?
 Yeah. It seems they really revere you.
 I don’t know what you heard from those kids,
 but I can’t do that.
 I don’t deserve to.
 Deserve?
 Please tell them all for me. Tell them I’m never coming back.
 Sensei.
 Damn it. She hardly listened to me at all.
 Since it’s come to this, I guess I’ll try Grandma Tsunade directly.
 Naruto.
 Sakura!
 What is it?
 Kurenai Sensei says she’s going to quit Squad 8,
 so I’m going to try asking Grandma Tsunade directly.
 I think that’d be useless… Probably.
 It’ll be okay.
 As for me, I know the place where she keeps her alcohol hidden,
 so if I threaten to reveal it to Shizune…
 What I meant was that she must have some good reason for quitting.
 What? What? By any chance, do you know something, Sakura?
 Huh?
 You know something, right? Tell me.
 No, don’t know anything.
 Come on, tell me!
 You’re a pest.
 Would I ever do something like eavesdrop on someone’s important talk?
 What? You eavesdropped?
 Yikes!
 You idiot. Don’t talk so loud!
 Yakumo?
 Yeah. If I remember correctly, that’s what she said.
 I am at fault for letting Yakumo become like that.
 No, I’d say instead that she was fine up until now
 because I put her in your custody…
 Shizune, how’re the nursing arrangements?
 A three-man team consisting of
 two Medical Ninja and one Anbu Black Ops member
 are keeping a 24-hour watch over her in a mountain cottage near Satomi Hill.
 Even so, you can’t rest easy?
 No.
 I want to take responsibility in my own way.
 Speaking of Satomi Hill, this morning…
 The conditions are spot-on.
 What was the girl’s name again?
 Yakumo.
 Yakumo. Thanks, Sakura.
 Hey, Naruto. Don’t tell anyone I said anything!
 Yeah, I know.
 If that girl is Yakumo,
 then she might know something about Kurenai Sensei.
 Lee, you are not stepping in deep enough.
 Right.
 Kurenai Yuhi.
 I make this request with full confidence
 that you are the best practitioner of Genjutsu in this village.
 Could you take charge of that girl?
 Who’s this girl?
 Yakumo Kurama.
 You know about the Kurama Clan, don’t you?
 Yes.
 At one time, they were a clan excelling in Genjutsu
 and were a power in the Village Hidden in the Leaves
 in the same way as the Uchiha Clan.
 But they haven’t been blessed in recent years with talent,
 their force has weakened and
 they have not been able to turn out Jonin-class Shinobi.
 Yakumo Kurama is the Kurama…
 Yes… She’s the only daughter of the Murakumo of the head family.
 She has health issues and is not enrolled in the Academy.
 Then you want me to take charge of her
 and train her to be a practitioner of Genjutsu?
 No.
 There’s no doubt Yakumo’s latent Genjutsu powers are excellent.
 So much so that those in the clan
 put their dreams of rebuilding the family on her.
 Was there some kind of problem?
 This is just between us.
 Yes.
 Yakumo’s parents, Murakumo Kurama and his wife died, but…
 You okay? Don’t push yourself too hard.
 I’m okay. I’m fine.
 I’m just a bit out of breath.
 Listen to me, Yakumo.
 A Shinobi is not your only path.
 Huh?
 You’re a girl and you should have many other ways to live.
 I want to become a Ninja!
 I heard there’s a student named Rock Lee who can’t use Ninjutsu and Genjutsu
 striving to be a Ninja just with Taijutsu.
 I may not have much physical strength,
 but I could become a Ninja if I were to use that power, right?
 A Ninja like you, Kurenai Sensei.
 I’m not a teacher like Guy.
 Unfortunately, I cannot train you.
 All right, that’s all for today.
 Thank you very much.
 Take a bath and get a good rest.
 Right. Good-bye.
 Lee has improved again, huh?
 I heard. lt seems you’re quitting Squad 8.
 I have no choice.
 Those who develop under me end up not developing.
 It’s not like that.
 Although they’re no match for my team,
 the growth of the Genin in your team is striking.
 If that’s the case, it’s not because of my help.
 It’s the results of their own efforts.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 What do you think it is that we can do?
 As you say, Lee growing to that extent is due to his own efforts.
 All I did for him was to believe in him.
 We believe in our pupils even at the cost of our lives.
 We just need to believe in them with all our power,
 and embrace them with all our power.
 It’s not a difficult thing in the least.
 Guy, I envy you…
 I couldn’t even do something that simple.
 Hey, Kurenai.
 Believe in yourself!
 From where and how are Kurenai Sensei
 and that girl from this morning connected?
 It would seem to be worth looking into.
 That must be the Satomi Hill mountain cottage.
 Satomi Hill Cottage
 The east trap?
 So it seems.
 An intruder?
 Yes.
 Kurenai.
 Good work on your 24-hour guard. I came to visit Yakumo.
 This late at night?
 Yakumo is resting inside.
 Could you guys step away for a bit? I want to talk to her alone.
 Yes, ma’am.
 Don’t be long.
 I’ll be done in ten minutes.
 Fine.
 Nothing but creepy paintings.
 Please, Sensei!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 Whoa, my heart, my heart!
 Huh? There’s nothing wrong.
 Hey, it’s you again?!
 To think you’d transform into Kurenai with a Transformation Jutsu.
 Hey, what the heck was that earlier?
 Shut up! For your sake, don’t be nosing around needlessly.
 Hey.
 You’re Yakumo. Right?
 I want to ask you something about Kurenai Sensei!
 Damn it.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Why am I sleeping in a place like this?
 It’s because you trespassed into the cottage
 under special security, remember?!
 Oh, right.
 Geez, really…
 Just be grateful you still have your life, the Anbu Black Ops are on this case.
 The Anbu Black Ops?
 That’s right, I have no time for this!
 Hey Naruto, where are you going?
 Sorry Sakura, I have to ask Kurenai Sensei about Yakumo!
 Oh, hey wait! Naruto!

198,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 Blaze Away, Byakugan! This is My Ninja Way!!
 Kiba!
 Naruto!
 This isn’t good.
 Oh my, what’s wrong?
 So you’ll just stay there and become larvae food?
 Queen Bee…
 That kind of stuff shouldn’t be effective, should it?!
 Chakra…!
 Byakugan!
 It’s no good… There’s no way I can make it in time!
 Naruto…
 I don’t know when to give up!
 That’s right…
 I know that Naruto would never give up, no matter what the situation is!
 Hey, did you catch them?
 What a foolish group!
 They made this creature mad…
 And they all got bound in wax!
 Bees make wax.
 You’re an insect handler and you don’t know that?
 He’s right! C’mon, are you really an insect handler?
 What about the Bikochu?
 Nothing.
 We did an all-out mobilization and searched,
 but we haven’t found it.
 Aren’t these guys carrying it?
 That’s unthinkable.
 So that means…
 So we’re going to have to ask one of these guys, after all.
 Who’s gonna talk?!
 We can tell you.
 Shino!
 However… lt’s in exchange for Hinata.
 That’s stupid, isn’t it? To bargain…
 Do you not understand your position?
 You guys definitely will not find the Bikochu.
 And you’re pressed for time.
 You are the ones…who will regret it.
 What should we do?
 If things stay like this,
 the Bikochu won’t be of any help even if it hatches.
 In that case, our mission is also…
 But…
 If we can get rid of even one of the Aburame family…
 Hinata…
 Are you worried?
 Of course!
 She’s strong.
 Huh?
 Much more…than you think.
 I concede. We have a deal.
 First of all, we need our friend.
 What happened?
 The brat…isn’t here.
 The wax she was trapped in isn’t there.…
 She may have been swept out to the waterfall.
 Jibachi!
 It can’t be helped! I warned her not to make a bad move or she’d die.
 You!
 What did you do to Hinata?!
 What happened to Hinata! Hey!
 Shut up, kid.
 The kid’s probably in the depths of hell about now.
 Damn you!
 Aha, the girl’s your girlfriend?
 You…! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 You’re kidding me. What can you do looking like that?
 Without Hinata you’ll never get your hands on the Bikochu either.
 You are right…
 That girl’s death was not part of the plan,
 but in the end, it’s a good thing.
 Because…we’ll take your lives in return.
 From the very beginning, people from the Village Hidden in the Leaves and
 from my own Village Hidden in the Stones have been sworn enemies.
 It’s natural that we kill each other, isn’t it?
 What're ya gonna do, little guy?
 Die like this?
 Or if you tell me where the Bikochu is, I could save you for now.
 – All right. – Don’t you dare tell them!
 Those jerks, I’m going to blow them away!
 Shut up, brat!
 – Jibachi? 					– Hey!
 Shut up, I’ve got to kill him!
 It’s a Paper Bomb!
 You’re…!
 Y-You’re…!
 …still alive!
 That was really close. But I didn’t give up, just like Naruto…
 Did she escape from the wax? lt can’t be!
 These are not ordinary kids.
 Leave it to me!
 Hinata!
 I’ve never used that in an actual fight…
 But I have to do it here, now!
 Bee Bombs Jutsu!
 1000 Bee Stingers Jutsu!
 Bee Swarm Jutsu!
 Naruto…
 Naruto… Watch me.
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 palms!
 – What?! 					– What?!
 You’re kidding, right?
 That Hinata can do such an amazing Jutsu?
 The Hinata that you know, Naruto, is from when?
 What do you mean?
 You’ve learned new Jutsu since the Chunin Ninja Exam, haven’t you?
 Hinata has been steadily developing, too.
 She always has been concerned…
 Take aim.
 That’s nice, the three of you,
 all have something you’re good at and something you like.
 Hinata, you should find something, too…
 You’re right.
 By the way, what is it?
 You had some business with me, didn’t you?
 Yeah…
 I want you to join me in my training.
 Hinata was fretting over what she could do…
 What she should do…
 Hinata!
 Hey, I don’t think that we should…
 No… Don’t go easy on me!
 If you’re doing it for me…
 Do it seriously!
 I’ve got it!
 During the harsh training,
 Hinata discovered her own styles… and her own special Jutsu.
 That’s the result of her training.
 Huh? You, why!?
 I’ll tell you something…
 Angering the Queen Bee, getting encased in wax,
 it was all part of the strategy.
 With our Chakra being sucked and being immobilized,
 it was the only way to protect ourselves from the larvae…
 And, do you think I was doing nothing while I was captured?
 I was ordering my bugs. The wax we’re wrapped in is very weak.
 Shino!
 Because of her hard training,
 Hinata’s Chakra control has dramatically improved.
 That Jutsu is what she developed from the training…
 Protective 8 trigrams 64 palms!
 Hinata’s already flexible body combined with fine-tuned Chakra control
 could completely defend an attack from every direction…
 Truly, it’s an ultimate defense Jutsu.
 Yet it’s different from Neji’s 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation.
 It’s Hinata’s own Jutsu…
 She finally worked that out on her own.
 She probably did it because she wanted to be acknowledged by her father.
 To be acknowledged by everyone…
 And to be acknowledged by you.
 Our Jutsu isn’t effective at all?!
 What the hell is going on?
 What a girl!
 Hey, what happened to those guys?!
 When did they?!
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Blow them away!
 Hinata!
 Shino!
 Believe…in her.
 Make the Chakra…
 sharper, stronger…
 bigger, more flexible…
 more…more…more… more…more…more…more!
 Hinata!
 Hinata!
 Naruto…
 Hinata, that’s an awesome Jutsu! You’re really awesome!
 Naruto…!
 Let’s hurry. It’ll be dawn soon.
 – Okay! 					– Yeah!
 Oh, it’s becoming a pupa already?
 If we make it smell Sasuke’s scent at the moment it hatches,
 the mission is complete.
 Right!
 Sasuke… Wait for me!
 No way!
 Inside the tree, huh.
 If it was there, the bees should have found it…
 You can still move?
 This insect cage was coated with secret Aburame family insect repellent.
 Wh-What?
 The bees won’t come close because of the repellent.
 As long as you’re using bees to search… you definitely won’t find it.
 I expected as much.
 I think as long as your clan exists…
 my clan maybe destined to be ruined some day.
 But!
 I absolutely will not let you succeed at your mission!
 Even if it kills me, that Bikochu…
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 This is our hope… in order to get our friend back!
 I won’t let you do that!
 Shut up!
 Rasengan!
 Hey, look…
 The pupa is hatching!
 Okay!
 Huh? It's gone!
 You had it ‘til just a minute ago!
 Hey, search for it, hurry!
 R-Right…
 Byakugan!
 Naruto! Over there.
 You blew it away the instant you set off the Rasengan!
 Hurry!
 I know!
 C’mon, c’mon.
 It’s going to hatch!
 We did it! Hurry, make it sniff this…
 Wh-Why…?!
 That thing just now doesn’t count! C’mon, sniff Sasuke’s smell!
 It’s all over now.
 Huh…?
 Hey! Stop! Wait!
 So you failed because you farted!
 Take responsibility!
 What are you saying that for?!
 Well then…
 That’s…the Bikochu, isn’t it?
 Naruto… I found you!
 C’mon, forgive me already, Sakura!
 No! I absolutely will not forgive you!
 – Sakura, you look so scary! – Come back here!
 So the mission failed…
 It seems that they succeeded at protecting the Bikochu,
 but failed at getting it to smell the scent of Sasuke Uchiha.
 I see… Hinata must be depressed.
 This strategy was her idea, wasn’t it?
 Well… Looks like that’s not the case.
 Hinata… I heard that your mission failed.
 Yes. It didn’t work at all.
 I have to train more and more… and work harder next time!
 I-I see… Good luck.
 More…
 More…
 More…
 More!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What! Why do I have to go on such an easy mission?!
 Don’t complain! You’re the one who picked up this mission’s client!
 That’s no reason! After all, I’m busy with a lot stuff!
 That’s enough, or I’ll send you back to the Academy!
 That’s not fair…
 No arguments! Neji, Tenten, Lee, Naruto!
 The four of you, I’m delivering your new mission.

199,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 Hurry!
 Right…
 We’re close!
 There are two enemies left…
 There are three of us… lt’s three against two.
 We might be able to do it with one more contact if we do it well.
 All right! All right! Let’s do it!
 No! It’s four against two!
 Okay, okay! I’m sorry.
 Counting Akamaru, it’s four against two!
 Let’s finish it quickly with our new technique next!
 Say, say. If necessary, I’ll do an awesome Shadow Clone,
 so it’ll be okay!
 That’s reassuring…
 But my strategy comes first. Got it?
 Y-Yeah…
 For that purpose,
 we have to catch up before the sun sets at any cost.
 I know. Full throttle!
 The sun’s starting to set…
 Neither Jirobo nor Kidomaru have come.
 It seems they’re having a hard time.
 It doesn’t matter… More important is Lord Orochimaru.
 We’ve only completed one-third of the journey in half a day…
 They all have Curse Marks, huh…
 No questions asked, huh?
 This is gonna be different than that time before
 with your surprise attack…
 Too much interference…
 Yeah, this is bad…
 We don’t know whether we’ll make it in time at this rate!
 Damn! We still can’t catch up…
 No, this is good enough.
 We’ll maintain this distance and continue the pursuit…
 Wh-What do you mean?
 I mean, we’re delaying the attack until dawn breaks.
 Get real! We can’t afford such leisure !
 That’s right! Besides, if we’re going to attack anyway,
 isn’t it more advantageous to use the darkness and attack?!
 For us, the darkness works to our advantage
 only the moment we launch the attack.
 It’d be close to impossible to grab Sasuke,
 get away from them and escape to a safe location
 in just that one moment.
 If we couldn’t get Sasuke back in that one moment,
 they’d probably just focus on guarding the coffin.
 If that happens, we wouldn’t stand a chance in the darkness.
 On the contrary,
 for the part where they wouldn’t have to move needlessly,
 suddenly they’d get the advantage.
 It’d be a different story if we had Neji’s Byakugan, but…
 Hey, come on.
 Aren’t you forgetting Akamaru’s nose and mine as well??
 I was sure to include your senses of smell in the calculations!
 Even so, up ahead they have the geographical advantage.
 Plus…
 if I can’t use my Jutsu, it’ll be no use.
 Even if I seal off their movements with Shadow Possession Jutsu…
 the effect would be reduced to half if clouds were to cover the moon.
 It’s a drag, but there are too many dangers, and uncertain elements.
 But!
 Got it!
 Naruto?
 You’re the leader…
 I’ll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!
 Right. I’m counting on you!
 The Vessel Arrives Too Late
 Hey, Tayuya! Will we really make it in time?
 I was just told to deliver Master Sasuke by tomorrow.
 By tomorrow, huh?
 I can’t say that we have lots of time to spare,
 but I guess we’ll make it in time.
 I hope so.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Sasuke…
 No Sasuke…yet?
 He’s running out of time… He can’t go on any longer.
 Lord Orochimaru…
 Several bodies have been prepared for you!
 And…you could even use me, if necessary…
 It has to be Sasuke…
 How long do you think I’ve waited?
 It’s a matter of urgency!
 The Third Hokage’s Jutsu…
 His curse was stronger than expected!
 Take this! Sealing Jutsu! Reaper Death Seal!
 Wh-What’s this sensation?
 Seal!
 My arm…
 If you don’t “reanimate” right now, you’ll lose everything!
 Is that what you want?!
 Lose everything…
 I’ve selected and prepared proficient bodies for you.
 Please leave it to me! Also…
 I’ll handle the recovery of Sasuke as well.
 Shall I use Kimimaro?
 Curse you …
 Third Hokage!
 Release!
 Listen well, everyone!
 I shall release you from this prison…
 However, it’ll only be one of you!
 Now all that’s left is to wake up Kimimaro, huh?
 Just as I thought…
 I wasn’t summoned this time, either.
 Dr. Kabuto, I…
 Take care of your body.
 Your role is now finished.
 It’s not Sound Ninja Five now, Kimimaro…
 I…still haven’t…
 Your replacement has already been found.
 He possesses power equal to your “Earth” Curse Mark.
 He has been given the “Heaven” Curse Mark.
 Additionally, he even has the Kekkei Genkai.
 Wonder who’s stronger…
 What’s the matter? Don’t get too excited.
 Dr. Kabuto…
 M-My life, how much do I have left?
 You shouldn’t talk anymore…
 P-People… People are born with some kind of meaning…
 Since people are born,
 there must be some kind of important calling.
 Recently I’ve started thinking so…
 That the meaning for being born…
 For people, finding the meaning is…
 the only freedom God has given.
 I understand what you want to say.
 Indeed, Lord Orochimaru is now suffering.
 It’s an unprecedented difficult situation,
 but I’ll mince no words.
 What can you do now?
 You’ve now lost your value as a “vessel.”
 A new vessel is heading this way.
 Well…
 At this point in time, it’s too late, but…
 Okay! You said you were going to let one person out of here.
 You’re going to keep your promise.
 What’re you doing? Open the door now!
 What? There was another one?
 Hurry up and…
 No…I… I’ll be eaten here, right now…
 I’ll let you out of here…
 And I shall grant you just one wish.
 My clan that was captured for your experiments.
 Please release them.
 Sure. Consider it done.
 You don’t have to worry.
 Your strong will is going to remain as Residual Aura inside me.
 It’s not like you’ll lose everything.
 Now then, your flesh is mine…
 With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body will, once again
 be unable to reanimate for several years.
 However, there is the next time.
 I-Indeed…
 my body no longer has value as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.
 It will now be difficult for me who has lost everything…
 to find my own calling.
 I’ve finally understood that…
 Even if it’s not me,
 I’ll bring in the new “vessel” even if it costs me my life.
 That’s my repayment to Lord Orochimaru…
 That’s the only redemption for me for being worthless…
 Hold on a minute!
 Are we almost there?
 No… It should still take a while.
 More importantly…
 What were those idiots Jirobo and Kidomaru doing?!
 We caught up!
 All right! I’ll take care of this nice and quick!
 R-Right away?!
 Eat this!
 Multiple Fists Barrage!
 Chakra in his palm…?!
 Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?
 Rasengan!
 N-No way… His hands now…?!
 There’s no point if I catch you before you do it!
 Now, Kiba!
 Tunneling Fang!
 This was also a Shadow Clone?!
 Luring Sakon into alignment with me…
 and aiming at me from the start?!
 You think you succeeded just with that?!
 Damn!
 I’ve been nailed.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!
 A diversion…
 He’s coming!
 Tayuya! What’re you doing idling away?!
 N-No!
 Why do you move forward?!
 I can’t dodge!
 Here you go!
 Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!
 Shikamaru! Let’s get out of here!
 Yeah!
 Punks…!
 You scums… Messing around with us.
 They were full of openings just as I thought.
 Having too much ability individually is also a problem…
 It went well.
 Yeah, it went just as calculated!
 Just in terms of teamwork, ours was way better than theirs.
 I won’t let you get away!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak

 Damn it! To come this far and have another one appear!
 On top of that, there’s something out of ordinary about this guy.
 What’s this bloodcurdling feeling on my back?
 Indeed, we are even on numbers, two against two.
 But this…
 I’m sorry, Naruto. He’s my miscalculation.

 Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
 Uh-oh!
 8 Trigrams 2 Palms!
 4 Palms!
 8 Palms!
 16 Palms!
 32 Palms!
 64 Palms!
 What’s going on?!
 A golden body surface…?
 It’s the same material as the weapon he spit out of his mouth earlier…
 That was close.
 I hear that if you’re hit straight on with Gentle Fist,
 your Chakra Network gets damaged
 and you become unable to build up Chakra…
 That was close.
 Are you a monster?
 It seems to come not just from your mouth.
 Gum Style Spider Thread…
 is a metal that hardens the instant it leaves my body.
 Moreover, it doesn’t let Chakra through.
 And…it can be secreted not just from my mouth,
 but also from the sweat glands throughout my body.
 Attacks on Chakra points won’t work. Now it makes sense…
 The Spider Web Net won’t work.
 And there’ll be no close-range combat fighting
 against a Gentle Fist opponent.
 In other words,
 I just have to attack the blind side from long distance.
 There’ll be no sound… lt’ll be in a flash.
 The game’s over.
 The Kunai Knife is a fake!
 What?!
 8 Trigrams Palm…
 Rotation!
 Wha–?! What is that?!
 Does he…have eyes behind him?!
 And the defense just now…
 He repelled physical attacks with Chakra?!
 360 Degrees of Vision: The Byakugan's Blind Spot!
 If we’re not prepared for “one person, one kill,”
 then it’s not going to work out…
 That’s what you said earlier.
 Hurry up and go! I’ll catch up with you all!
 We have to be prepared for “one person, one kill.”
 Naruto…
 You’ve got better eyes than me.
 Neji…
 Catch up with us, no matter what!
 Can he see me?!
 What the heck is he?!
 I know you’re there.
 Come out.
 Those eyes…
 It seems they can do more than just see through the Chakra flow…
 So I see there was an extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.
 A long range battle is unfavorable…
 I must bring this to close combat by all means.
 Very well.
 I’ll acknowledge that this game has a somewhat high level of difficulty!
 I too shall go for it seriously…
 It’s like he’s a totally different person from before…
 His Chakra activity is overwhelming.
 And those markings…
 His move earlier…
 He dodged an attack aimed from behind
 and was able to see me hiding in the shadows.
 In other words,
 he has a combined wide range of sight and X-ray vision.
 And what’s more, that Jutsu…
 If so…
 Summoning Jutsu!
 Your ability…
 I’ll find a way to impeccably assault it.
 If he defends against physical attacks
 with a large emission of Chakra and its Rotation…
 all I need to do then is to stop that Chakra Rotation!
 Scatter!
 Rotation!
 It’s starting to stop.
 Here!
 Die!
 He released the Chakra just in time and repelled the Kunai Knife!
 To think he’d stop my Chakra Rotation
 by binding it with Chakra threads…
 These things…
 I just have to cut them for now.
 If the Rotation won’t do,
 then I just have to dodge each and every one.
 This guy uses close-range Taijutsu-style combat .
 There will be no problem if I fight him from afar.
 In that way… I’ll have a good long look at your ability.
 8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!
 What a number!
 Hm?! His stance changed?!
 8 Trigrams.
 128 Palms!
 He’s fast! The number of strikes has doubled…!
 If I get nailed by that straight on, it'll be the end for me.
 If that’s the case on his end,
 then it’ll be a battle of numbers on this end, too!
 The number’s too great! I won’t have enough time!
 The Rotation’s no good, just as I thought…
 It seems he has 360-degree vision.
 And it seems he deals with enemy attacks
 by combining his X-ray vision ability for seeing through things
 and his telescopic vision ability for long-distance sight.
 Furthermore, although he’s got 360-degree vision,
 that vision has a formidable extent…
 If I were to determine the range from his reaction before…
 he almost unfailingly detected the Kunai Knives
 that entered the approximately 150-foot circumference around him.
 But for some reason,
 there are Kunai Knives he can’t evade completely.
 If so…
 8 Trigrams, Sixty…
 I see…
 This time, there’ll be even more.
 This time, two will hit…
 I’ve found a way to impeccably assault your ability!
 It seems that defense technique
 was something to compensate for this weak point!
 In other words... Your Visual Jutsu isn’t perfect!
 Why even bother?! I’ve won the game!
 Come on. Are you going to keep at it for naught?
 The fate of the small fry character in an easy game is to be destroyed right away!
 You can’t beat me!
 – I-I’m not done yet. – Lee…
 You never give up do you?
 No way you can beat him. He’s a genius unlike you.
 Genius? What is genius anyway!
 Even without any talent, I’ll surpass “genius” by working hard.
 It’s no use, Lee.
 No matter how hard you work, you cannot beat me.
 It’s already decided.
 Lady Hinata...
 You’re the sheltered little baby of the main branch.
 A person can never change.
 And then, this match…
 Your destiny was decided at the point when I became your opponent.
 You don’t know until you try!
 This is the end…
 Gentle Fist!
 Small fry character one… Destruction completed.
 Well, for a crummy game, I was entertained…
 Heh… I missed the fatal spots, huh?
 And he wouldn’t easily die from Kunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?
 I see… He’s still going to entertain me, huh?
 This is thanks for that.
 Seriously, that fat Jirobo can’t be helped,
 but what’s that clod Kidomaru doing anyway…?
 That lowlife!
 He’s got the habit of playing games.
 Maybe he’s found someone to entertain him?
 When that idiot plays too much,
 he becomes hyper and easily gets into that state…
 But still... Once he gets to the second state…
 it’s instant death for the opponent.
 Maximum destructive power… with 100% accuracy!
 Die!

 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words

 And you smiled

 He doesn’t carry out wasteful attacks.
 And he accurately reads information from the results.
 No mistake, this guy’s the strongest of all I’ve fought up until now!
 I probably won’t be able to evade the next attack.
 I’ve had enough. I can’t dodge it anyway.
 Since the secret of my eyes has been discovered, I won’t run or hide!

201,"Connecting old words that have been used up
 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
 That's why it must be good-bye
 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
 Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away
 The Leaf's Handsome Devil!
 Blast!
 No matter how many times you try…
 it’s the same!
 I’ll acknowledge you.
 You’re not only sharp…
 You’re also very determined…
 In addition, I’m nice, too…
 Striking a helpless woman is against my policy…
 But however I look at it,
 you don’t have the feel of a helpless woman…
 in your case!
 Don’t be getting full of yourself
 just because you released the Genjutsu, you little clod…!
 She’s still not completely bound.
 Damn it…
 I can’t lose!
 A little more…
 What Chakra she has?!
 Even if I bind her at point-blank range,
 she still pushes back…
 But , I’ll get hammered for sure if I let go now.
 After all, I just have to put this to rest with this Jutsu.
 Hang in there, Akamaru!
 Damn it… What’s going on?!
 Damn it!
 One more…to go…
 This guy’s crazy strong…
 Not a single hit with that many shadow clones…
 It’s about time…
 I’ve been eagerly waiting.
 Lord Orochimaru’s ambition… The first step…
 Sasuke…
 Sasuke! What’re you doing with these guys?!
 Come on! We’re going home now!
 Sasuke…
 Hey…
 Should we go home?
 Yeah!
 We’ve both made it to the top!
 I want to fight you too.
 Hey… We’re going home.
 Everyone’s worried about you.
 So…
 Sasuke!
 Please. Bring back Sasuke…!
 You can hear my voice, can’t you?!
 Wait, Sasuke!
 It’s futile…
 Die.
 Who’re you?
 The rejuvenated…
 Leaf Village’s Handsome Devil…
 Rock Lee!
 B-Bushy Brow…?
 Bushy Brow, you! What about your body…?
 More importantly, Naruto. Go get Sasuke.
 But…you…
 Please leave this person to me!
 This guy’s…good…
 Bushy Brow! Be careful! He uses his own bones to attack.
 Bones…you say…?
 He’s crazy strong…
 What’re you doing?! Please go, quickly!
 Naruto…
 You also promised Sakura with a “nice-guy pose,” right?!
 I’ll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!
 It’s a promise of a lifetime!
 This person…I’ll beat him!
 I promise!
 Right!
 I won’t let you!
 Die.
 Please don’t ignore me!
 Oh…
 Bushy Brow…
 You don’t have the time to be inattentive!
 Good response!
 However…
 If Sasuke is inside that coffin…
 It’d be totally impossible to take them on with a Genin team…
 We Jonin are in this plight….
 We should organize a special team and send them out for backup.
 We can’t do that…
 Ever since Orochimaru’s attack,
 the Leaf is currently losing strength as a great land.
 You understand that the Jonin and Chunin are being totally mobilized
 in order to take out possible domestic and international dangers.
 Even if the Sharingan were to fall into Orochimaru’s hands…
 We should now prioritize avoiding war with other lands.
 But… I’m sure the Orochimaru situation isn’t a problem that can be deferred forever.
 If he regains power… He’ll promptly attack again…
 I know…
 I’m not such a fool.
 I was sure to think about it and measures have already been taken.
 In here!
 What’s wrong, Guy? You’re on the brink of exhaustion.
 Did something happen on your mission?
 No… I took care of the mission and ran back with all of my might…
 More importantly…
 Lee! What happened with Lee’s surgery?!
 It was a success.
 He can start training starting tomorrow if it’s just for Jutsu.
 Well, bed rest for a while would be best though.
 Th-There’s trouble, Lady Fifth Hokage.
 Rock Lee is gone!
 No!
 Next will be the end.
 Damn it… Last night while I treated Genma and Raido?
 Lee…
 That fool… He went after them.
 And…he must’ve been really flustered…
 He took my bottle of sake for a bottle of medicine by mistake….
 SAKE
 Sake?!
 Uh…Uh-oh…
 What’s wrong, Guy?
 Actually, when Lee drinks even a little bit of alcohol…
 Things get…so messy…
 Get so messy?
 Severe Leaf Hurricane!
 He’s agile… My kicks don’t hit.
 You’re flexible to a surprising extent…
 And you make unique movements, eh?
 You’re too…straight forward.
 It’s over…
 Please wait!
 I’m sorry. lt’s about time for my medicine!
 I have to be sure to drink it, so…
 Excuse me a moment.
 I’ve always disliked medicine.
 It…happened before when I took him to a restaurant
 to celebrate his acquisition of the “Hidden Lotus.”
 Lee mistook my sake for water…
 As soon as he drank just a small cup…
 of the sake, things got ugly…
 Got ugly…?
 After a silence that was like right before a storm…
 The moment I realized it,
 the restaurant…
 had gotten all messed up…
 Medicine always tastes stran…
 What…? What did this guy drink?
 Messed up? What do you mean?
 He’s terribly….!
 Lady Tsunade… Lee goes into
 an incredible drunken frenzy!
 Huh…?
 Who the heck are you?! Hey!
 Geez, who are you anyway?
 Acting cool… So irritating…
 Hence, he’s a natural user of…
 Drunken Fist!
 Sasuke!
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 Would you think it was a bother if I approached you?
 Despite my doubts, I worked up my courage
 My clumsy attempts with words
 You listened without turning away
 No wonder I get carried away by you
 But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?
 I feel so sad
 But…
 For the first time, I spoke to you
 And you smiled
 For the first time, I was able to speak
 In my own words
 For the first time, I spoke to you

 How about my strategy?
 This is the Shinobi Secret of reading the double bluff!
 Guy Sensei! I did it once again! Yeah!
 But, what’s this?! The world is oddly…
 f-floating, and I’ve no inclination of losing!

202,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 And the next match.
 This year’s rookie looks challenging…
 Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
 It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!
 What we’ve been waiting for!
 It’s finally my turn!
 Yeah! Lucky us!
 If it’s this guy, we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!
 Show us how much you’ve grown.
 I’m going to do it!
 Akamaru Unleashed! Who's Top Dog Now?
 The seventh battle, Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.
 I got sick of waiting!
 It’s finally time for me to shine! Believe it!
 That’s my line!
 With you as my opponent, I’ve as good as won!
 Right, Akamaru?
 Don’t get excited!
 You won’t be able to beat me!
 Why you little…!
 Hey! Don’t bring your puppy!
 He’ll get in the way of the match!
 You fool!
 Akamaru’s going to fight with me.
 Hey, hey! Is that okay?
 Yes.
 Animals and insects are treated the same as ninja tools.
 There’s no problem.
 Well, that’s fine!
 It’s a perfect handicap!
 Talking tough!
 Then…
 Akamaru, don’t put a paw in this.
 I’ll fight him by myself!
 Naruto! Don’t lose to a guy like this!
 It’s finally come.
 Naruto, huh?
 I’m sorry, but he can’t beat Kiba...
 Kakashi.
 Naruto...
 I-I want to support you, but…
 Kiba’s on my team…
 Kiba will get mad…
 But…
 Naruto…
 Kiba’s lucky.
 Hah!
 Hah! I don’t know how strong he’s become since this guy became a Genin…
 Today we’ll run through Transformation Jutsu.
 You’ll change yourself into Lord Hokage…
 His ability was “that,” so…
 Transform!
 So noisy...
 I was sleeping comfortably…
 T-That was a joke! I-I did it on purpose!
 Enough, Naruto!
 It’s your third year at the academy!
 Wha--?
 Goodness sake, who is that guy?
 We’ve just switched to this class and already found someone funny.
 That guy, he’s on a roll.
 He’s an attention-seeker, huh?
 One more time, fool!
 Transform!
 You…
 Is it possible…?
 Hey hey, are you serious?
 You’ve been here for three years and can’t even do a respectable transformation?
 All of you watch now!
 I will absolutely someday become  the true and a real Hokage!
 Lame!
 What Hokage?!
 Some sympathy at the very least…
 I’ll do you in, in one clean blow!
 Really? But you can’t beat me!
 I said not to act tough.
 Well then. Please begin!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry: All-Four Jutsu!
 Here I come!
 Fast!
 It will be a while ‘til he opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.
 Just as I thought.
 That Naruto can’t be equal to Kiba.
 Naruto…
 That was too embarrassing to watch.
 See…
 What was that? That guy is weak.
 Naruto!
 Huh?
 Yes, that’s it…
 I’ll surpass Hokage!
 Then everyone in the village will acknowledge my existence!
 Those are his words…
 I’ve always made fun of them, too.
 This is the Jonin…a true Ninja…
 I have to escape…
 If I stay like this…
 I’ll really, really be killed!
 Are you hurt…
 Scaredy cat?
 You just need to become stronger than me!
 Darn you!
 You!
 What are you doing all of a sudden?!
 T-This stupid coward is... absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!
 Don’t mess with me!
 W-What?
 But, it was wrong!
 Hey...
 are you hurt?
 Scaredy cat?
 I won’t change my words, that’s my way of Ninja!
 Naruto...
 Say it to everyone!
 Don't...
 Don't...
 underestimate me!
 Yeah!
 He seems to have grown to say such thing.
 Naruto…!
 Go, Naruto!
 What are you talking about, bleeding like that?
 Your tough talk has gone too far!
 I didn’t use my power fully… to observe your strength first!
 You too, cut out the tough talk and use the dog or whatever you want!
 You’ll regret this…
 Let’s go Akamaru!
 Smoke Ball?
 Take this!
 I can’t see!
 This is bad!
 I have to get out of the smoke… or I’ll be done for.
 It worked!
 What is it…?
 Shoot…I can’t see anything.
 Yeah! We did it!
 Yay! Good job, Akama--!
 A-Akamaru…
 Why?
 Why?
 You took the bait!
 Y-You!
 Transform Jutsu?!
 Ouch! Shoot!
 Let go!
 You smell like a dog!
 W-Where’s Akamaru?!
 Over here!
 Akamaru! Darn!
 No way!
 That's Naruto?!
 An equal match with Kiba…
 No, it may be more than equal!
 Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu to Transform Jutsu, that’s a clever trick.
 Naruto shouldn’t be able to do that…
 His timing at using Jutsu’s is very good.
 What? He’s better than I thought.
 But, to get mad like that after biting the opponent himself…
 What a funny guy.
 N-Naruto…amazing!
 That’s amazing, Naruto!
 You got a little bit stronger.
 But it’s over.
 Next, I’ll attack you seriously.
 Oh really?!
 But you will absolutely not beat me!
 During this exam, he’s matured again.
 This is a surprise…
 That’s Naruto, the perpetual goof…?
 Evidently it’s no longer “that” Naruto.
 Yeah.
 I wonder, what kind of trick Kakashi used…?
 Still…
 Huh?
 As for the development of my Kiba and Akamaru,
 it's probably more than Naruto.
 Naruto…I’ll take Akamaru... back!
 W-What's this?!
 What did you feed him? His fur turned red!
 That’s why he’s called “Akamaru”, red boy.
 Food Pills huh…?
 That Kiba…
 He intends to end it with this.
 Here we go, Akamaru!
 Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…!
 Man Beast Clones!
 T-There’s something wrong with their eyes!
 He’s using some weird drug!
 Isn’t this doping?
 Is this okay?!
 Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.
 You, that’s all you say!
 What?!
 What did that guy eat?
 It’s Food Pills.
 F-Food Pills?
 Food Pills are a secret medicine that people in the military take
 and fight for three days and three nights without a break…
 They’re high in protein, easily absorbed and
 have some types of component that influence agitation or sedation…
 Kiba and Akamaru’s Chakra must be doubled right now…
 It’s over with this…
 Let’s go!
 All-Four...
 Jutsu!
 N-Naruto!
 That Naruto is in danger!
 Kiba’s the gung-ho fighter type who will attack
 like a beast with Chakra wired throughout his body.
 And the Food Pills that double one’s Chakra are quite simply…
 the perfect pill for Kiba.
 Naruto…
 This isn’t good…
 There’s no way to counterattack…
 All I can do is gather all the Chakra in my legs
 and do my best to escape…!
 At this rate…
 Here’s my chance!
 Take this!
 Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!
 Fang Over Fang!
 This is the difference in our true powers.
 I'm going...
 to become the Hokage.
 I can’t lose here...!
 You? Hokage?!
 When you’re weaker than me?
 I’ll become Hokage for you!
 You know deep down inside that you can’t become the Hokage.
 So quit acting tough!
 You’re wrong, Kiba…
 Naruto...
 He’s not that weak…
 I’ll receive the name... of Lord Hokage!
 All of you, just watch!
 Naruto, unlike me...
 he has always believed in his own worth.
 I thought it was really amazing…
 It must have been really hard…
 I understand that.
 And yet before not even one person…
 tried to see Naruto.
 Hey, that’s the kid…
 I heard he’s the only one... who failed.
 Humph! Serves him right!
 It’s trouble if a kid like that becomes a Ninja.
 After all, that kid is really…
 Stop! Anything further is taboo.
 Nobody tried to acknowledge real Naruto.
 Clone Jutsu!
 But now…
 Everyone’s watching…
 Stand up! Naruto!
 Everyone is acknowledging him!
 If you compete with me for the name of Hokage…
 You…will be the loser!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 That Kiba, he sure is stupid.
 Think hard about your Jutsu when you use them.
 Otherwise, your opponents will take advantage of the Jutsu.
 Well, the outcome of you and me could be seen from the beginning.
 The way you’ve torn me apart up until now,
 I’ll give it back all at once!

 Release the Genjutsu and wake up Naruto and Shikamaru.
 He’ll be getting a mission after such a long while.
 What do you mean by a mission?
 Be careful…
 It’s the first A-Ranked mission since the Land of the Waves.
 Ouch!
 You were able to release the Genjutsu too!
 Why were you pretending to be asleep?!
 Track down Sasuke, join up and then stop him!
 Then await next orders in a safe place.
 Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!
 I’ll tell you the reason en route!
 Let’s go!
 H-Hey!
 I get it! So that’s what happened!
 That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
 So, why am I pulled into this? This is such a drag!
 It can’t be helped!
 It’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.
 This way!
 How long will it be until we catch up?
 I don’t know. He is moving at a pretty good speed.
 Dang it!
 A Shirker’s Call to Action: Layabout No More!
 Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.
 Huh? What is it?
 Did you find Sasuke?
 No!
 There are eight people in two squads behind us…
 No…
 There’s one more… There are nine people following us.
 What?!
 C’mon. Already?! Give me a break!
 It looks they haven’t grasped our location, yet.
 We must lose them.
 Hey, what’s the point of stopping?!
 Shut up and follow me!
 Huh?
 We’re going back over our footprints.
 If we do that,
 it’ll look to them like our footprints suddenly disappeared.
 But, they’ll notice even if we do this, right?
 It’ll buy us some time. That’s enough.
 It’ll be a matter for great celebration if our pursuers get impatient,
 cloud their eyes of pursuit and lose sight of the trail.
 Hurry!
 There’s no time.
 I-I know!
 This is not good.
 Though they're on alert for ambushes,
 they’re catching up with us slowly, but surely.
 Dang it!
 Probably they’re all Chunin or higher.
 We’ll be wiped out if they catch up.
 Wiped out…
 Dang it! Since it’s come to this, why don’t we ambush them?!
 Ambush?
 Right.
 Indeed, an ambush would be to our advantage.
 Even if the opponent has twice the people than we do,
 if we just catch them off-guard…
 That’s no good.
 Our opponents are former Leaf Shinobi Orochimaru’s henchmen.
 In the worst case scenario, there might be Jonin.
 I thought it’d work, but I guess not, huh.
 Hold it. Why?
 The level of opponent doesn’t have much to do with an ambush.
 What do you mean?
 You guys don’t get it.
 Listen. Indeed, an ambush is a very advantageous fundamental tactic.
 But two conditions are necessary.
 What are those necessary conditions?
 Number one.
 The ones on the run must act without making noise and find the enemy first.
 Number two.
 One must be able to catch the pursuers off guard,
 capture a point and position to be able to inflict certain damage,
 and conceal oneself quickly.
 Ah… Huh?
 An ambush only becomes effective when these two conditions are ensured.
 Well, the first condition won’t be so difficult
 since we have the Ninja Hound’s nose.
 And the second one also seems advantageous at a glance
 since we know the geography of our village.
 But Orochimaru has spent time in the Leaf before.
 That approach won’t work on his henchmen.
 So what do you really mean?
 Our pursuers must have been instructed in the terrain of this village
 and have gone through simulated practice for this fight.
 And on top of that,
 they’re probably all Ninja who have mastered the pursuit arts.
 So they know what cards we have, huh.
 Well, even so, the fact remains that an ambush is advantageous.
 But there are too many elements of uncertainty.
 In the first place, the enemy is a special unit organized for this operation.
 But we have a fool…
 a Kunoichi who’s nothing special…
 and one dog…
 and, me with the number-one cold feet!
 A tactic is grasping the conditions that are there without fail
 and formulating an optimal plan.
 And so, there’s only one thing that we can do now…
 One?
 A diversion in the guise of an ambush.
 One person will remain, pretend to ambush,
 and delay the pursuers.
 In other words…
 bait.
 Right. If we delay them,
 they won’t be able to grasp the positions of the remaining three.
 If we do that, we’ll be able to shake off our pursuers,
 but the one who has become the bait will probably…
 die.
 So, who’s going to do it?
 We need the dog to follow Sasuke.
 That means…
 Fine…
 – I'll… – I guess it has to be me.
 Shikamaru?!
 W-Why you?!
 It’s better than being wiped out, right?
 Besides, among us,
 the only one who is equal to playing the bait
 and who has the possibility of surviving…
 is me.
 Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Art originally intended as a delay tactic, so…
 Well, I’ll catch up later!
 Now get going!
 We’re counting on you, Shikamaru!
 Sakura!
 Yeah.
 Was Shikamaru ever this reliable of a character?
 Be careful…
 Shikamaru.
 No matter how much you try to erase the signs of your presence…
 you’re in plain view.
 Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.
 What did you say?!
 I wonder if he’s really delaying the enemy.
 Me with the number-one cold feet!
 Don’t tell me, Shikamaru…
 Shikamaru will be okay!
 Don’t tell me, he ran away.
 I said he’ll be okay!
 What’ll be okay?!
 He has a dirty mouth and always says stuff is a pain.
 But he wouldn’t betray us!
 He hardly ever says he’ll do something himself,
 but he makes sure to do it if he says it!
 That’s absolute.
 I want to believe… I want to believe, but…
 Pick up the pace!
 I somehow managed to get away completely.
 Their strides are irregular.
 Urgency is probably increasing their fatigue.
 Sorry about that.
 I was supposed to be the guy with the number one cold feet.
 It seems my character has changed just a bit this time.
 The fact that I’m tired is true.
 Those footprints are wrong.
 By the way, this is what the dog’s paw print really is.
 Oh, he’s still a kid.
 To think we’d all get caught like this.
 So this is the rumored Leaf Village’s Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?
 That’s an old way of saying it!
 The times are passing!
 It’s called Shadow Possession Jutsu now, old man.
 Sure enough, that match wasn’t good.
 I used too much Chakra. I can’t hang on much longer…
 1, 2, 3, 4…
 5, 6, 7…8.
 Eight people…
 Eight… No, there’s one more…
 There are nine people following us.
 Sure enough, the ninth person’s role is to protect against them getting ambushed.
 That person stays at a fixed distance,
 moves in the back and responds to an enemy attack.
 But…this will make clear where that person’s hiding!
 There, huh?!
 Dang it… The Shadow won’t reach.
 I don’t have the stamina to send it to Chakra.
 It’s futile. I see through your technique.
 Is this as far as it goes?
 It looks like you’re at your limit…
 This Shadow Possession Jutsu is going to break very soon.
 Prepare yourself!
 I wanted to… become a Ninja any which way,
 save up money any which way,
 get married any which way to an ordinary woman
 who’s neither beautiful nor ugly
 and have two kids any which way.
 First will be a girl, and then a boy…
 I would retire from being a Ninja when my eldest daughter marries
 and my son becomes a full-fledged man.
 And then I take it easy in my life of retirement
 playing Japanese chess and Go the whole day.
 Then I die of old age before my wife.
 Such a life would’ve been nice.
 I was out of character, I tried too hard this time.
 I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.
 What I did was a drag…
 Hmm, the movements of our pursuers have stopped.
 Yes! The delaying was a success!
 Shikamaru, eh?
 I’m sorry I doubted you, even a little.
 Okay!
 Now…you wait, Sasuke.
 And…Shikamaru…
 Live, and catch up to us no matter what!
 As you say, it seems I’m at my limit.
 Hey, come on out.
 While you’re at it, cut off his head.
 I finally caught up.
 A-Asuma?! Why?
 Well done, Shikamaru.
 Sure enough, out of character.
 For the time being, you retire here.
 Hurry!
 What a pest.
 The pursuers have increased? Two? No, three?
 Kankuro! Pick up the pace!
 Okay.
 I won’t let you get away.
 Don’t jump the gun, Sasuke.
 Sasuke.
 Now then, shall we begin?
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile

 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 I don’t know what’s going on!
 Why is Old Man Hokage fighting with Orochimaru?
 Why is Sasuke going after that guy with shadows around his eyes?
 I don’t understand why we have to go after him,
 but that’s what we have to do right now!
 Wait up, Sasuke!
 Next time: “An Unrivaled Match: Hokage Battle Royale!”
 What the heck’s happening to the village?!

204,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 I see. Sakura, you've come, too.
 Now you can formally register  for the Chunin Exam.
 What do you mean?
 Actually, from the start,
 only three-man squads could apply and take the exams.
 But Sensei, you said that the decision to take the exams
 was up to the individual.
 Yes… I said that.
 Were you lying?
 Yes, I was…
 If I said that,
 Sasuke and Naruto would probably forcefully convince you to take it.
 Even if you didn't have the will to apply,
 if Sasuke asks you
 you would attempt to take the exams half-heartedly.
 For Sasuke's sake and, well, Naruto's.
 Then, if…
 it had only been Sasuke and Naruto who had come here?
 I would've stopped the Exam here.
 I wouldn't have felt like letting them go beyond this point.
 But…you guys came here on your own will.
 Sakura!
 Naruto!
 And, Sasuke!
 I'm glad you came.
 You're a team I'm proud of.
 Now then, go on!
 Okay! Let's go!
 Genin Takedown! All Nine Rookies Face Off!
 W-Wow!
 W-What's with…this?
 There are so many of them…
 Could it be that they're all applicants?
 They…all look…immensely strong…
 Sasuke, you're late!
 I thought I'd be able to see you for the first time in awhile,
 so I was waiting in excitement.
 Get away from Sasuke! lno-Pig!
 Oh, my. It's Sakura.
 Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh… Ugly!
 What did you say?!
 What's up with this?
 Huh?
 Are you guys going to take this bothersome Exam, too?
 Oh, it's the idiot trio.
 Quit calling us that!
 Man, this is a freaking bother…
 Shikamaru Nara.
 Always complaining, has no motivation.
 He's a bellyaching idiot.
 Choji Akimichi.
 He's always eating something.
 That's all he is, a fat idiot.
 Sasuke…is mine. Bleah!
 Ino Yamanaka.
 She's always fighting with Sakura. She's her rival.
 A Sasuke-crazy idiot.
 Yahoo, I found you!
 My my, everybody's here.
 H-Hello…
 Oh…
 Hinata Hyuga.
 She's a weird person who turns her eyes away whenever I look at her!
 She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.
 Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.
 They're louder than I am!
 He always brings his dog and always has a bossy look.
 He really annoys me!
 Shino Aburame.
 As for this guy, I really don't get him!
 He's a type I'm not good with.
 What did you say?
 You guys, too?! 					 Man.
 Ha! I see.
 This means all nine Genin rookies are taking the Exam, eh…!
 Now then…
 How far can we go?
 Eh…Sasuke?
 Hmph!…
 You're mighty confident. Kiba.
 We've trained a great deal, so...
 We won't lose to you guys!
 Shut up!
 I don't know about Sasuke, but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!
 I'm sorry. Naruto…
 Kiba didn't mean it like that…
 Huh?
 Akamaru, you've become tasty-looking…
 What?
 Don't step on it.
 Huh?
 I said, don't step on it.
 You're…gonna eat that?
 Hey, you guys!
 You should be a little quieter.
 You guys are the ""rookie nine"" … fresh out of the academy, right?
 Carrying on like that with cute faces…Man.
 This isn't a field trip.
 Who're you? Acting all haughty!
 I'm Kabuto Yakushi. Anyway, take a good look around you.
 Behind you… They're from the Rain Village.
 They're hot-tempered.
 Everyone's tense before the Exam.
 I thought I'd warn you guys before you get your butts whipped…
 I guess it can't be helped.
 You're rookies who don't know left from right…
 You remind me of my old self.
 You're Kabuto…right?
 Yes…
 Then, is this your second time?
 No…
 It's my seventh time.
 Huh?!
 This Exam is only held twice a year, so it's now my fourth year.
 Then that means you know a lot about these exams?!
 Kind of…
 No kidding. Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?
 But you haven't passed.
 Yeah, well, that is the case, yes…
 Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?
 Man, this is utterly bothersome…
 Then, maybe I'll give a bit of information to my cute juniors.
 With these Ninja Info Cards.
 Ninja Info Cards…?
 To put it simply,
 they're cards that have information burned into them and coded with Chakra.
 I spent four whole years gathering information for this Exam.
 There are close to two hundred of these cards.
 They are pure white to the eye…
 To open the data on these cards...
 What're you doing?
 The way it works is that no one can see the info
 without using my Chakra…
 For example…Like this…
 \Whoa, awesome! What information is this?
 The number of test-takers and participating nations,
 and the number of applicants from each respective village
 is individually displayed.
 Why do you think that
 the Chunin Exam is jointly conducted in the first place?
 It's said it's done to deepen friendship among nations first
 and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.
 ""It's said""?
 That's right.
 The real aim is in the checking of Shinobi levels of neighboring nations
 and keeping power balance equal.
 Power…Equal?
 Why such bothersome things?
 If that's not done,
 the weak nations will be invaded by the strong nations in no time at all
 and may end up being controlled unilaterally.
 There's a point to mutual supervision. Probably.
 Hmph…
 Of those cards,
 are there ones with detailed individual information?
 Yes, there are…
 Are there ones you're concerned about?
 Yes, there are!
 The information for the applicants this time around is not perfect,
 but is burned in and saved.
 You guys included…
 About those ""ones you're concerned about,"" who you know.
 Anything's fine, tell me their information and I'll retrieve it for you.
 Gaara of the Sand Village, and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.
 Oh, you even know names.
 That makes it quick.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 Here they are!
 Please show me.
 I don't really get what's going on, but I'll pretend like I do.
 Well then, first is Rock Lee.
 He's one year older than you guys.
 His mission experience, twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.
 His squad leader is Guy…
 In just this year, his Taijutsu has drastically improved, but...
 His other skills are not good at all.
 Last year, he'd attracted attention as a Genin rookie with his ability,
 but didn't participate in the Chunin Exam.
 This is his first time taking the exams, same as you guys…
 Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team…
 Huh? Hyuga?
 Next…is Gaara of the Desert.
 His mission experience, eight C-ranks. B-ranks…
 Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh…
 He's a Shinobi from a different land and is a rookie,
 so there is no further detailed information.
 But…
 It seems he has returned from all of his missions uninjured.
 B-rank as a Genin… But uninjured…?!
 What is this guy?
 Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass, Waterfall, Sound…
 There are lots of exceptional Genins from those villages
 who have come to take the Exam this year as well.
 As far as the Village Hidden in Sound goes,
 it's a village of a small nation that just sprang up in recent years,
 so there isn't much information…
 At any rate,
 they're all Hidden Villages with nothing but crackerjacks.
 That kind of makes you lose your confidence.
 Why are you saying that now?
 In other words…
 all of the applicants who have gathered here…
 That's right!
 Not just Lee and Gaara,
 but they're all choice top elite Genin from each nation.
 Hmm.
 This isn't going to be easy.
 I can't go along with this!
 They may be your subordinates now,
 but they are children who were my students.
 If it's about them I know…
 It's as you say, Iruka.
 It's not going to be that easy.
 You're too eager.
 I postponed my team's test-taking for one year
 and took care to build up their skills.
 Have them take the Exam after they've enjoyed their life a little bit more.
 Hmph…
 They might be too easygoing.
 But they will surpass your guys in no time.
 That's enough.
 That's as far as the rookie matter goes.
 Now then, next…
 I'll take recommendations for Genin other than rookies.
 Well! Don't pour cold water on this…
 I said that, nevertheless…
 I wonder if even the fearless ones are frightened just this time around.
 Stubborn as he is,
 he's still consumed by this atmosphere and number of people.
 He's tense.
 It can't be helped.
 Even though everyone is a Genin, we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.
 I'm very, very uneasy.
 But…
 It's kind of tough looking at Naruto who's not himself.
 Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.
 Say…Naruto! Don't be so scared.
 Huh?
 My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
 I won't lose to any of you! Got it?!
 Say! What's with him?!
 That idiot would never get depressed! Absurd!
 It won't do any good to provoke everyone!
 Don't tell me!
 If I don't tell it to you, who do I tell it to?!
 What did you say?!
 Oh, I feel better.
 Hmph…
 Isn't that the guy from before…?
 The dog's bark is bigger than its bite.
 Is he an idiot…?
 He's mighty high-spirited.
 He's hot-headed, eh.
 Lee, maybe you did not bully him enough.
 Did you hear?
 Sound Village is a minor Hidden Village of a small nation.
 That's offensive.
 Maybe I'll…play with them a bit.
 Yes, being referred to as something like leftover Shinobis and all.
 We'll add this to his data.
 Those Sound Shinobis are brutal in their own way.
 I won't lose to any of you, you say?
 You said it…!
 That idiot…
 In no time at all, he's made enemies of his surroundings.
 What're you talking big for?! You!
 But, I just said what was true, I say!
 E-Everyone, that was a joke.
 This guy's quite an idiot, you see…
 After all, he says idiotic, spazzy, scatterbrained things
 and gets carried away,
 so please don't concern  yourself with him.
 Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!
 I'm going to kick your butt!
 Shall we do it?
 Let's do it.
 Learn how to read atmosphere already, you!
 Fine!
 These guys…are the Sound Village…
 He dodged it!
 I can see through that speed.
 I see… It's that kind of attack, eh?
 What's going on?
 He was supposed to have evaded it.
 Why'd that happen to his glasses?
 Probably grazed the tip of his nose.
 He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.
 Huh?!
 Oh! He puked?!
 K-Kabuto?
 Huh?!
 Hah!
 Hey, Kabuto!
 Are you okay?!
 Yeah…I'm okay.
 Really?
 Oh, so he's not so special.
 Even though he's a veteran who's been taking the exams for four whole years.
 Write this on your card.
 The three from Sound village… Doubtless Chunin.
 Kabuto should've totally read the attack…
 But why did he vomit?
 Lee. How about that technique just now?
 I had no problem reading the speed.
 There's some kind of trick...
 Silence! Degenerates!
 Sorry to keep you waiting…I
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 It feels like the chance to show off the fruits of our training has finally come.
 Well, no matter what kind of test it is,
 it's gonna be a snap!
 I'm picturing Sasuke and them bowing to me and saying,
 ""Naruto, we're really no match for you.""
 Huh? Is this for real?!
 Next episode: ""Start Your Engines: The Chunin Exam Begins!""
 As for me,  I'm going to kick butt once again!

 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.

 Naruto…!
 He came in totally late.
 Hmm? Where’s Sasuke?
 The Dosu guy I’m supposed to fight isn’t here, either.
 Hey, you guys over there.
 Throw out your chests and show your faces to the spectators!
 You guys are the stars of this “final round”!
 Sasuke hasn’t been found yet?
 A team of several Anbu members are searching all over,
 but they have found nothing.
 He might already be in the hands of Orochimaru…
 If that’s the case, we may never find him.
 I understand.
 Well-well… Lord Kazekage.
 You must be tired having come all this way.
 No…I’m glad the arena is in the Leaf Village.
 Even though you’re still young, it would probably be a tough journey for you
 if you had to go to the trouble of traveling someplace else.
 Shouldn’t you decide on the Fifth Hokage soon?
 Please don’t treat me like an old person.
 I’m still planning on being Hokage for another five years…
 Now then, I guess it’s about time to begin.
 Everyone, thank you very much for coming
 to the Village Hidden in Leaves Chunin Exam.
 We will now begin the “final round” matches
 for the eight who made it through the preliminaries!
 Please watch until the end!
 If there are supposed to be eight, it looks like there’s one missing.
 I have something to tell you before the match.
 Look at this.
 Huh?!
 There was a slight change to the tournament.
 Check who you’ll be facing one more time.
 Here, I had more preliminary matches than the others…
 So the Dosu guy dropped out?
 I thought I’d pound you here…
 If I did that, there’d be the possibility for me,
 as the one remaining after the first battle, to fight Sasuke.
 W-What are you?!
 Say…
 …say.
 What?
 Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come.
 What’ll happen?
 I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out of the hospital room at that time.
 Something could’ve happened to him…
 In case a competitor does not arrive by the start time of his match…
 he or she will lose by default!
 It doesn’t make sense.
 Knowing his character, he’d come even if he had to drag himself.
 Where are you going, Gaara?
 To verify my existence… one more time.
 One more time.
 What’s wrong? You should still be able to move, right?!
 Sasuke! Come on!
 Could it be…?
 Even after I warned him to avoid doing anything to stand out…
 He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchiha also, did he…?
 Listen up, you guys.
 The terrain is different, but the rule is that there are no rules,
 the same as in the preliminaries.
 The matches will continue until one or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
 However, if I judge that it has been settled, I’ll stop the match there.
 Arguments will not be allowed.
 Understood?
 So the first match is…
 Naruto Uzumaki.
 Neji Hyuga.
 Just those two remain and the rest of you go to the waiting room.
 Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
 Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
 Uh-huh.
 This match will be quite interesting!
 Naruto…
 Say, Sakura.
 I understand that you’re worried about Sasuke.
 But why don’t you cheer for Naruto at least a little bit?
 Hmm. You’re right.
 That being said,
 with Neji as his opponent, Naruto has no chance of winning.
 That is…!
 Not so, is what you’re going to say?
 But to think that brat would survive until this point…
 I wonder if this is as far as it goes
 for those who survived just by luck, after all.
 That Naruto.
 This is not a good opponent at all.
 No matter how you look at it, he can’t beat the Hyuga clan.
 Well, that’s what I thought at the beginning…
 But you’ll all be surprised if you underestimate him.
 Akamaru, what’s wrong?
 What did you say?!
 What?! Where?!
 There!
 What’s Anbu, the Black Ops, doing here?
 Is something going on…?
 You seem like you want to say something.
 I said it before, too, didn’t I?
 A failure is a failure. You can’t change.
 I promise …
 I’ll win, no matter what!
 He has the look… of being sure of himself…
 It’s as if he’s not all worked up…
 That makes it more worthwhile for me.
 I look forward to your look of disappointment…
 when you know the true reality…
 Stop whining.
 Let’s…get started!
 Now then, round one.
 Begin!
 Watch carefully, Hanabi.
 Nobody has inherited such a strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
 To say nothing of your older sister.
 More than big sister?
 Perhaps more than you, too.
 This time, it’s not an opponent that can be managed easily.
 He has that Byakugan.
 Close combat is no good…
 Does Naruto know that?
 Idiot! Why would anyone attack from the front?!
 No! Naruto.
 The opponent can see your Chakra Points!
 They're called Chakra Points.
 If those pressure points are pressed accurately…
 the flow of an opponent’s Chakra can be stopped,
 amplified or controlled at will.
 Uh-oh!
 I missed, huh…?
 In other words, he’ll press the pressure point if I get too close
 and I’ll become unable to use Jutsu.
 That means all I can do is fight from a distance.
 You understand, right? You have no way of winning.
 Heh… All I did was to verify your power.
 The real fight is just getting started!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 You used your head, didn’t you, Naruto?!
 With the Shadow Clone Jutsu…
 Heh. He’s an interesting kid.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu is a Jonin level technique.
 To think he could use such an Jutsu…
 Who knows how this’ll turn out?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
 I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed among the clones,
 indeed, I can’t detect the real one even with my Byakugan.
 But there’s only one real one, after all!
 Heh. Don’t be acting tough!
 If you’re going to come, then come.
 It’s pointless.
 In front of that Neji’s defense, it’s not just all attacking.
 Hey!
 Don’t…you…underestimate…
 …me!
 Here they come!
 He hit!
 Fool.
 Wha--?!
 Dang it!
 I’ll get you next time!
 Here!
 This guy…
 Does he have eyes behind him…?
 You’re going to become… the Hokage…?
 With this level, it’s impossible.
 I can generally tell with these eyes…
 Intrinsic abilities are set.
 Figuratively speaking, everything inherent about people is set.
 Why…?
 Why are you always so judgmental like that?
 Then…are you going to say that anybody can become the Hokage…
 if they just work hard?
 Only a very small percentage of Shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
 Look more at reality!
 Those who become the Hokage are born with a destiny.
 It’s not something you become by trying to become it.
 It’s determined by destiny.
 People must live within their different respective currents
 that can’t be defied.
 The one single… destiny everyone has equally…
 ...is death.
 Those eyes…
 He still holds a grudge against the head family, huh?
 So…
 So what?!
 I don’t know when to give up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
 Two! He kisses and hugs everyone randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”
 Three! Masala masters Yoga but hates curry
 Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes his time for digging black ships
 Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene, Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
 Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
 Four! Japanese people, now lend me you hand!

 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 All over the world, the sky’s smiling, so look up and smile too
 Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Fight! Fight! Fight!
 Darn it! What is going on?!
 It was clear that my punch got him, but I’m the one who was thrown!
 Darn it! Even though I promised Hinata….
 I really cannot lose at a place like this!
 The next hit will be the big one that I’m gonna give him!
 Just prepare for it!

 I just want to convey my simple thoughts
 That day's faint wind blows away
 at the castle ruins of yesterday
 I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
 Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?

 Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
 In time, we'll realize that it was everything
 And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears

 What?!
 I can’t believe I had to get to the second state
 for an opponent like this one…
 Slamming Palm
 What…What is that appearance?!
 Now that it’s come to this, it’s over.
 In the second state, I can put out ten times more power than I have thus far.
 I’m invincible.
 It’s too painful to move…
 Who knew that the side effects of the Curry Pill would be this intense.
 This is what happens…
 to a powerless scum for butting in!
 Playing Ninja better suits you!
 Raise your hand if you’re playing Ninja.

 W-Wait!

 We finally caught ‘em!
 I’m sick of this! The team with Choji always loses!
 Sorry…
 I need a lot of Chakra for this ""second state.""
 I’ll take whatever Chakra you have left!
 Well then, I’ll take them now.
 There’s not much left…
 You’re empty!
 I haven’t had nearly enough to eat…
 I said I haven’t had enough to eat!
 Huh…?
 What, just one last piece, huh…
 When I said I haven’t had enough to eat…
 Just as I thought, you’re the scum used as a sacrificial pawn.
 Die…you pitiful fatso, the odd man out.
 I won’t let you play Ninja with us!
 Why?
 Because if we let you play, we’ll lose.
 You’re slow.
 Yeah, but…then the number of people won’t be even.
 Japanese chess is fun because the number of pieces are even.
 A piece that is useless is the same as not having that piece!
 Yeah, that’s right!
 We’re the ones with fewer people and we’re not complaining.
 Hurry up, let’s do it!
 if it’s okay with you, then it’s fine…
 Okay, it’s settled!
 We can win it!
 Yes!
 Where are we gonna hide this time?
 And um, the whole Akimichi Clan is fat and slow…
 That’s what everyone says.
 Really...
 But Choji, you’re a kindhearted guy… more than everyone else.
 One day, you’ll surely make friends who’ll see that quality of yours.
 And then you should cherish those friends
 and be the kind of friends who believe in each other…
 Can I really make…friends like that… someone like me…?
 Rest in peace…
 you’re not the only one I’m going to get.
 After I kill you,
 I’m going to get the cruel, sleazy, mean guys who used you as a sacrifice!
 Because he…promised…
 You better catch up with us…Choji.
 Okay!
 He’s definitely going to defeat the opponent and come after us…!
 Yep!
 That’s right…he can do it.
 Okay! While I’m here…
 Me too…
 All right, everyone,
 we get Sasuke back before Choji catches up!
 Wait!
 All right! Here we come!
 He’s late…that Jirobo…
 He’s greedy and eats so much…
 He’s probably squeezing out Chakra even from the marrow of their bones.
 I wish he had switched with me already…
 Here, I’ll give it back!
 Well, then…
 If I linger, I won’t be able to catch up.
 It’s about time to put an end to this.
 The Chili Pepper Pill is left…
 But…if I take that… I’ll die, without a doubt…
 Don’t you dare die, Choji…
 We’ve been doing things together since that day…
 Oh…! You…
 You…were there just now…
 What about playing Ninja?
 It was a drag, so I pulled myself out from it.
 Huh…?
 By the way, that’s my special seat.
 Your special seat?
 I like to lie on my back and look at the clouds on a nice day like this.
 You’ve come to look at clouds?
 Mind if I sit there?
 Oh…sure!
 This is a good place. You can see the clouds well.
 Yeah…
 Why don’t you…
 What…?
 watch the clouds with me and lounge around?
 Okay!
 You know! I-I brought snacks. Want some?
 Oh, that’d be great!
 Thanks.
 Eating potato chips while watching clouds…this is the best.
 Yep!
 My name is Shikamaru… from the Nara Clan.
 You… What’s your name?
 It’s Choji! Choji Akimichi of the Akimichi Clan!
 Choji, huh… I think I’ll get along with you.
 Me, too!
 We’ll always do things together from now on, too.

 Shikamaru… Sorry…I can’t go…
 It’s over…
 But, this guy…
 I have to beat him… even if it means death.
 No matter what you do now, it’s too late!
 Crushing Palm!
 Wh-What’s that…?
 But…
 Boulder Blow!
 It’s no good!
 I’m 100 times stronger than before!
 They say that food can be a reason
 for people to hold a horrible grudge against somebody.
 The blow just now… was for eating the last bite of my snack…
 No way!
 This guy has so much Chakra that his body has changed physically!
 And this is…
 for making fun of me by calling me a sacrificial pawn and fat!
 But what I can’t forgive you for more than anything else …
 You sure do suffer when you have a stupid leader. You underlings!
 Well… I’ll kill you losers
 before you suffer working under a glum shadow lover like him!
 You should blame your stupid leader for choosing you!
 You insulted my best friend!
 More than mocking me by calling me fat,
 and poaching the last bite of a four-star meal…
 I can’t forgive you for that!
 All of my Chakra…to my left hand!
 Uh, uh-oh…!
 This blow…is heavier than my life!
 W-Wait…! Don’t be hasty…!
 I…I won.
 Me… I won!
 Everyone…
 But Choji…
 you’re a kindhearted guy, more than everyone else…
 One day, you’ll surely make friends who’ll see that part of you…
 And then you should cherish those friends
 and be the kind of friends who believe in each other.
 “Hurry up and get over here.” lt’s Naruto.
 “Everyone’s waiting.” 					Kiba…
 Shikamaru…
 Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Even if it is just potato chips,
 I won't let anybody else have the last piece, no matter who you are.
 Choji and I have worked as a team for many years,
 so coordinating with him is easiest for me.
 Dad…
 I’ve made…a lot of friends…
 What happened?
 Nothin’…
 Once in a long while, once in a while
 The remnants of a person broken by dreams
 Look like a mountain
 Clinging to the Divine, clinging to Buddha
 The remnants of a person crying
 Look like a mountain
 Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
 This is my victory pose, round and around  (round around)
 Shake shake shake Let’s look
 With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Look like a mountain
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Take this!
 Fang Over Fang!
 Byakugan!
 That damn spider bastard!
 Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji. Our careful planning is not working!
 If we dawdle Sasuke will be gone!
 Hey, what should we do?!
 If we want to continue our pursuit, there’s only one way to do it!
 Next time: “Your Opponent is Me!”

207,"Hey boys, listen up!
 Humans aren’t such a big deal
 Who needs tomorrow anyway,
 so don’t hide your fists
 You’re not old enough
 to sell your dreams away to uncertainty
 Hey boys, you’re the only ones
 who can pull the trigger in your heart
 All the kids said
 We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,
 awesome world right at this moment,
 All the kids said
 Don’t forget every truth or lie
 All the kids said
 We’re way too young to die
 In this empty town lined with empty faces
 All the kids took off
 into this windless night
 Because they want to change something
 The Three Villains from                     the Maximum Security Prison
 All right!
 I can start my training!
 Right now, this is all I can do. I can’t allow myself to fail!
 What’s up?
 Going to all the trouble of coming to pick me up like this…
 You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s after this anyway, right…?
 Taking the time to converse once in a while…
 that’s also part of teamwork.
 Let me hear about your mission.
 It was pretty incredible…
 But you wouldn’t understand even if I explained it to you.
 I don’t want Akamaru to experience that kind of thing ever again.
 And for that reason, I must polish my Jutsu all the more…
 I want to hear about it in detail.
 Because that’s what teamwork is about.
 Are you sulking
 ‘cause you were the only one who was passed up?
 You are sulking, aren’t you?
 There have to be more further up…
 Until I can see it…
 I can’t believe you’re doing that from the morning…
 Neji, let’s take a break.
 Okay!
 – Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay!
 Father, see you later.
 Barbecued meat? This early in the morning, huh?
 Just when he was looking good after losing some weight
 when he was released from the hospital.
 He made an amazing rebound, didn’t he?
 With that good an appetite,
 there aren’t any more worries about his health, are there?
 When I’m done eating, help me with my training, okay?
 Asuma Sensei!
 Hey, are you an idiot or something?!
 You’re recuperating, you know!
 L-Lee… Come on, let’s take a short break…
 What’s the matter, Guy Sensei?
 The prime of one’s youth waits for no one, you know.
 Maintaining the prime of one’s youth is starting to get tough…
 Thank you very much!
 Do your best, guys…
 I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by the next time you’re here!
 M-Me too…
 I want to become a Kunoichi just like you, Temari…
 I’m honored.
 I apologize for asking you to teach at the Academy…
 since we’re so short-staffed right now.
 You probably would've preferred to go sightseeing or something.
 No problem. I’m doing this because I enjoy it.
 Yeah… And we were also able to survey
 the future potential of the Leaf’s military power…
 Well, be careful going home.
 Okay…
 If something happens again, I’ll come to your rescue again.
 Just let me know, crybaby.
 You always say too much. That’s why girls are…
 Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru!
 All right, everybody’s here right?
 You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata…
 Y-Yeah…
 All right! Everybody stand ready!
 I can’t…lose to Naruto…!
 All right! I’m ready!
 I just have to wait for Pervy Sage to come--!
 There he is!
 But my training…
 Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.
 Some work came in all of a sudden. lt can’t be helped.
 It’s just gonna be doing an interview
 for some obscene magazine anyway, right?
 That kind of thing isn’t called work.
 It’s a mission to gather information about the Akatsuki Organization.
 But if I tell this guy that,
 he might ask me to let him come.
 Humph!
 I’ll make it up to you by…
 Huh?
 W-What’s this?
 It’s so that you don’t get bored while you’re staying at home,
 it’s a special training menu I put together!
 Wow!
 Wait, wait!
 My own prized secret training methods are inscribed here.
 Don’t read this where other people might see it!
 Okay!
 Well, do your best!
 I’m gonna use this to train vigorously!
 Thank you, Pervy Sage!
 The walls have ears… paper doors have eyes…
 Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…
 WILLPOWER
 What?!
 Pervy Sage!
 Since I have been entrusted
 with the great Village Hidden in the Leaves that you built,
 no matter what danger might strike, it is my duty to protect it.
 The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.
 Yes, you really do.
 Is that you, Shizune? Enter!
 All of these reports regarding the village’s internal affairs accumulated
 because so many things were happening in the Leaf Village.
 I guess the only thing to do is start at the top.
 Leaf Maximum Security Facility.
 Did its name change?
 Yes, in the past it was called
 Prison Specializing in Capital Offenses Ninja.
 Fortunately, because there is a downward trend
 in felonies committed by Shinobi,
 along with the downsizing of the facility, the name was changed as well.
 Incarcerated are murderers,
 those who were involved in leaking classified secrets, and so on.
 They are all criminal Ninja…
 There haven’t been any noticeable disruptions in the past few years
 and the facility has been relatively stable.
 – Food! 					– Food!
 It’s finally time to eat, isn’t it, Elder Brother!
 Yeah! I’m so excited!
 Hey! Fujin! Raijin!
 If you don’t shut up, you’re gonna go without dinner!
 Gimme a break! Those guys…
 You may pass!
 Hey! Wait!
 You’re hurt, aren’t you?
 Go to the dispensary later and have that looked at.
 Okay…
 All right, next!
 H-Hey, Elder Brother…
 Huh?
 Why is the little finger short and weak?
 That’s easy, Raijin.
 If the little finger was thick and strong,
 then your thumb would have no leg to stand on.
 I-I see!
 Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!
 – Huh? 					– A lizard!
 Raijin, you’ve always been a dandy one from way back.
 W-We haven’t had enough to eat, have we, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Not asking permission again…
 What’s the matter?
 What’s up this time?
 I’m starving…
 G-Give us something to eat!
 Oh no… If these guys find out I don’t have anything…!
 Um…right now…
 Don’t tell me that you don’t have even one offering…
 to these Fujin and Raijin brothers?!
 Well…wait…wait…!
 What do you think? Tastes good, huh?
 I’ll bring you something else later!
 Right now make do with that!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Are you okay?
 Those guys are quiet when they have food.
 But if they get angry they’re out of control.
 Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades over food during a mission
 and the people around just barely managed to hold them down.
 Something smells good?!
 Yeah.
 This way!
 – Food! Food! Food! – Food! Food! Food!
 I just can’t get to liking clerical work.
 There’s still a whole lot more to do, Lady Tsunade.
 I wonder what this is?
 It looks like a formula for some kind of medicine…
 A formula…
 Send an available Jonin here immediately!
 Yes, ma’am?
 Hurry!
 Y-Yes, ma’am!
 How about it… Does it taste good?
 I see…I see… There’s still a whole lot more.
 Just as I thought,
 that good smell was coming from your place, Elder Brother!
 Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother always has delicious food!
 It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?
 ’Cause I’d feel so sorry if you guys had to go hungry.
 Elder Brother…
 – A lizard! 					– A lizard!
 I see, I see…Happy?
 How about it, you guys?
 Don’t you want to eat things that are even more delicious?
 W-Where are they at?!
 If we go to the place where an old friend of mine is…
 you can pig out on food that’s even more delicious than here.
 Is that the guy you told us about long time ago, Elder Brother?
 Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…
 Gimme a break… that guy’s gotta be kidding!
 That Pervy Sage…
 just leaving me and my training up in the air!
 Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.
 Master Jiraiya had a mission too.
 Heh!
 It’s probably that Lady Tsunade decided
 that only Master Jiraiya could do the job…
 It can't be helped.
 Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s doing, after all, huh!
 Well, I guess all I can do is treat you to some ramen noodles like this.
 So cheer up.
 I’m gonna go complain to Old Lady Tsunade!
 Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!
 N-Naruto!
 Damn… another annoying situation.
 Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!
 This is about a year ago,
 a Chunin Academy staff member used Naruto
 to sneak out the Scroll of Sealing.
 According to the report, it was a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.
 The crime was solved, but…?
 Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.
 The possibility has arisen that a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.
 This is a clue…
 This is something that Mizuki was concealing
 when he was incarcerated in the Maximum Security Facility.
 At the time, nobody thought of it as anything more than a doodle.
 Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?
 I don’t know, however…
 The handwriting resembles the document confiscated from the facility
 where Orochimaru was conducting human experiments…
 Which means that… Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!
 The possibility of that is not zero.
 It’s not like a Chunin alone could do anything with the Scroll of Sealing.
 It would only make sense if Orochimaru were pulling strings from behind.
 Asuma! Kurenai!
 Go immediately to the Maximum Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!
 Orochimaru?!
 Be careful! Something’s strange here!
 Yeah… It’s too quiet.
 Let’s go!
 Oh, how touching. A welome party for us…
 Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome. Right, Elder Brother?
 Yeah…
 Asuma, don’t tell me that those guys are…
 Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…
 Fujin and Raijin!
 Asuma…
 Hey, you guys are whooping it up too much for a welcome party!
 Hey, calm down… the welcome party’s just started.
 His character has changed completely…
 All you jerks…
 You will…be our offering!
 Do it!
 Orochimaru!
 Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!
 Crappy news pass us by
 And you become speechless
 My voice is way too soft
 So you don’t answer
 You’re crying   Crying alone
 What can I do?   I’m crying too
 “Let my lonely scream ring out through the night”
 I’ll thrash this confused era with my speed   Yeah
 And I’ll thrash this confused night with my speed   Yeah
 I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar and my speed   Yeah
 This sinking world and its evil bastards, I’ll kick their butt   Yeah
 What’s the matter, Ton Ton?
 What in the world happened?
 Say, weren't you together with Shizune?
 Don't tell me something's happened to her?
 I don't know what happened, but take me there, Ton Ton!
 I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

208,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 It’s been a while since I’ve eaten Ichiraku ramen!
 Lately I’ve been away from home on missions.
 The bowl of ramen after a mission…
 it spreads to every muscle of the body and becomes energy for tomorrow.
 If you eat ramen it drives fatigue away.
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Ramen!
 Temporarily closed…?
 No, it can’t be…
 I endured all the tough missions, looking forward to Ichiraku ramen…
 I can smell ramen!
 What?
 You're right!
 Without a doubt… Ramen is being made in there!
 Ramen!
 Mix it! Stretch it! Boil it up! Burn Copper Pot Burn!
 This smell…
 It’s the smell of a soup
 that’s never been on the Ichiraku menu before.
 Then… It's temporarily closed to develop a new menu?
 Who’s there?!
 A large helping of miso char siu ramen! With an egg please.
 I see…
 You were looking forward to my ramen that much.
 Sorry about that.
 It’s okay to develop a new menu,
 but I wish you’d do it after the shop is closed.
 Since you came all this way. Give this a taste.
 Could this be…
 Ichiraku’s new menu?!
 Let’s eat!
 Wait a minute!
 There are rules when you’re eating a new ramen for the first time…
 Rule ♪1!
 Before you do anything,
 you must first have a sip to taste the soup.
 – Delicious! 					– Delicious!
 Next, you have to coat the noodles in soup and eat.
 Huh? It seems like something is missing…
 Let’s get to the point.
 The noodles are outdone by the soup!
 This well-seasoned, rich soup greatly surpasses
 any of Ichiraku’s previous soups!
 But! The noodles are the same as always!
 The balance is very bad.
 I cannot give it a passing score!
 That’s what I thought…
 Oh… Don’t get so depressed…
 Ayame, water! Water please!
 Huh? Where’s Ayame?
 With ramen like this…
 I’ll never be able to get Ayame back from the Ryonin.
 Teuchi!
 He’s just overtired.
 I had him drink an energy drink, so after a little rest he'll recover.
 But… I think he should take a break from the shop for a while.
 He’s been using his arms too much…
 Look how swollen this is.
 Come to think of it, before he fell,
 he said something about Ryonin or whatever
 did something to Ayame, I think…
 Ayame is his daughter, right?
 What’s Ryonin?
 I don’t know…
 Ryonin… He’s referring to the Ninja Chef.
 Ninja Chef?
 Do you know about them, Choji?
 I’ve heard rumors about them…
 One of the problems Shinobi’s confront on missions is the problem of meals!
 Normally Food Pills were brought with them,
 but the main role of those are to supply nutrients.
 They have no taste.
 If they could eat delicious food while on missions,
 would the success rate of missions rise?
 Based on that theory, was born…
 The Ninja Chef… Ryonin!
 But what those Ninja Chef have to do with Ayame?
 They snatched her away…
 What?!
 What are you talking about?!
 Give us the details!
 It was two weeks ago…
 Ichiraku Ramen
 Welcome!
 The large serving, here’s your order!
 A good job as always, Teuchi!
 Hakkaku!
 His name is Hakkaku,
 long ago we trained at the same ramen shop…
 He told me he is a Ninja Chef, a Ryonin, these days.
 Actually… I have a favor to ask you.
 What is it? If it’s something I can do, I'll cooperate.
 The phantom recipe that I heard you developed…
 Please turn it over to me!
 Ph-Phantom recipe? What are you talking about?
 To a chef, a recipe is more precious than life!
 I understand why you want to hide it!
 But… please! Give it to me!
 I really had no clue.
 But Hakkaku didn’t believe me…
 Ayame. Let’s get to work opening the shop…
 What the… What’s this tray?
 Ayame!
 I have your daughter.
 If you want her back, hand over the “phantom recipe!”
 Damn that Hakkaku!
 Why didn’t you contact the Hokage right away!
 The Hokage could…
 If I did that, I don’t know what would happen to Ayame.
 And he also wrote this in the letter…
 That if I can serve them something impressive,
 he’ll give up on the phantom recipe and return my daughter safe.
 But, you've got a way to win?
 I don’t know.
 But a chef’s challenged me to a cooking match.
 I have no choice but to do it.
 So that’s why you’re developing new ramen.
 I was able to make the soup exactly how I wanted to.
 But…I just can't get the firm noodles that go with the soup…
 I can’t get Ayame back like this!
 The cooking match is tomorrow… What am I going to do?
 I can’t imagine an Ichiraku without Ayame.
 Okay! Teuchi! We’ll help you.
 We’ll make the best ramen…
 And get Ayame back…
 From the Ryonin!
 You guys…
 I'll teach you the basics of making noodles.
 Quickly mix the ingredients evenly.
 If there are discrepancies,
 there will be variations in the taste of the noodles.
 Next… Knead it.
 If you don’t put this properly the noodles won’t be firm.
 Are you okay?
 It's nothing. Don’t worry about me.
 And…stretch the noodles!
 It’s important for them to be of a uniform thickness!
 So there will be no differences after boiling…
 Try it.
 It’s easy to say it…
 but to actually make the noodles is not so easy.
 It takes five years to become an accomplished chef in his own right.
 To do it by the match tomorrow is completely…
 When it comes down to it,
 I’ll have to give up this decrepit body of mine to them.
 Teuchi…
 You’re not thinking about when you lose, are you?
 Th-That’s…
 Because if we are doing this,
 we’re doing it with the intention of winning, believe it!
 I absolutely don't forgive people who hold a girl captive!
 Cooking comes from the heart.
 Technique and experience aren’t everything!
 No problem…
 We’ll show them the real strength of the Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Sorry to make you wait, Hakkaku!
 The phantom recipe?
 You can’t tell by looking at me?
 I see. How foolish…
 Let me tell you,
 ramen like the stuff I ate at your shop the other day can't win.
 Is Ayame okay?
 Father!
 Ayame!
 The emotional reunion comes after the match.
 I have a favor to ask. Let me have some helpers.
 I don’t think those kids are up to the task, but…
 Well… That’s okay.
 Well, let’s start the cooking match!
 Let’s see if you can satisfy all of us Ninja Chef!
 There are so many of them…
 We don’t have time to stand around… Let’s begin!
 The preparation for the soup is done!
 I’ll prepare the ingredients for the rest!
 I’m leaving the noodles to you!
 – Okay! 					– Okay!
 Listen. Our noodles determine whether Ayame will return or not!
 We cannot fail!
 Seems like he’s done a good job with the soup…
 The delicious aroma is wafting over here.
 Indeed, it’s whetting my appetite.
 The noodles are the problem!
 Can those kids really make noodles that will go with that soup?
 First, mix the ingredients!
 They’re amateurs, I thought so!
 You can’t make decent noodles with that hand movement!
 We practiced making noodles all night!
 But, we didn’t make the noodles we wanted to by morning…
 Even so, we have to make perfect noodles!
 Hey hey. At least make us something edible!
 Quickly…
 Uniformly…
 Without discrepancies!
 Next, knead it!
 Hey, Sakura!
 Look, it’s Kakashi Sensei.
 Don’t play!
 Oh…
 Sakura…
 Oww! Sakura, you just can’t control your own crazy strength!
 It’s your fault for playing around at a time like this!
 This is…
 This is… the last of the ingredients.
 No problem. This time, let us show you we’ll succeed!
 Okay, I’m mixing.
 Wait Choji! Leave this to me!
 Naruto…
 Hey, Sakura…
 Huh?
 We are Shinobi, right?
 So then… Let’s show them the Ninja way to make noodles!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengen! “Ichiraku” version!
 Wh-What?! Mixing ingredients with Chakra?!
 No, that way he’ll surely be able to mix the ingredients uniformly!
 And in micro units!
 Sakura!
 What?
 Pervy Sage.
 Naruto!
 Cha!
 Wh-What’s this crazy strength…?!
 If she does that, the noodles will become super firm!
 Okay, Sakura!
 Choji!
 I, too…am a Shinobi of Leaf Village!
 Partial Expansion Jutsu: Both Hands!
 What?!
 What outstanding noodles!
 If those noodles are added to Teuchi’s soup, this match would…
 W-We cannot lose!
 It’s for the future of the Ninja Chef!
 Now they just have to be boiled, Teuchi!
 Okay! Leave it to me!
 Wait a minute!
 When the ramen is done…
 Who will you serve it to first?
 Huh? Who…?
 Th-That’s right… That’s how it is!
 That’s how what is?
 Among the chefs…
 there’s a cardinal rule not to be forgotten.
 The first guest to arrive is the first guest served!
 No matter how delicious the food you make is…
 if you break this cardinal rule, you’re disqualified as a chef!
 True, if a guy who came later were eating before me,
 then it would seriously pisses me off.
 There are 100 Ninja Chefs here…
 They all showed up at about the same time!
 So you have to serve ramen to 100 people at the same time!
 You’re four people…
 Can you really serve at the same time?
 I said we’re Ninja, didn’t I?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 What?!
 Now! Lift them!
 – Thanks for waiting. Here you go! – Thanks for waiting. Here you go!
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 Th-The taste is the issue! lf you don’t satisfy us, you lose!
 Delicious!
 – Delicious! 					– Delicious!
 I’ve never had ramen this delicious.
 So then…
 We win!
 – We did it! 					– We did it!
 The truth is…
 We Ninja Chefs are at the end of our rope…
 End of your rope?
 What do you mean by that?
 We endeavored to make delicious meals to eat during missions…
 We thought to make delicious food, to fill your stomach…
 that can be eaten anywhere…
 But we pursued taste too far.
 It was too delicious, people were compelled to overeat.
 And as a result…
 Ninja gained weight, and it interfered with their missions.
 And some people are now saying,
 “we don’t need the Ninja Chefs anymore.”
 – Oh… 					– Oh…
 For us Ninja Chefs to continue,
 we had to get our hands on the “phantom” recipe out there
 in the cooking world!
 Recipe?
 If we use this recipe,
 we can improve the performance of Shinobi without causing a burden.
 There’s such recipe…?
 I hear, it’s called “the scum recipe.”
 – The scum recipe?! – The scum recipe?!
 We've gathered information from everywhere…
 As a result,
 we learned that the scum recipe was at ""Ichiraku"" which Teuchi run.
 – What?! 					– What?!
 I-I don’t know!
 There’s no reason something like that should be at my shop!
 There’s someone who heard it!
 I've got ""the scum recipe"" at my shop, so…
 Oh… Teuchi…?
 Oh. I might have that.
 Are you serious?!
 I thought so!
 To be precise… lt’s the “scum removal recipe.”
 – Scum removal? – Scum removal?
 The trick to making delicious soup…
 is how well you remove the scum.
 So I, too, studied a lot.
 Eventually, I worked out a recipe that can remove the scum effectively.
 Usually it's called “the scum recipe” for short…
 I never thought that this misunderstanding would arise.
 That’s a pretty big omission.
 Geez. That’s a stupid punch line…
 We won the cooking match,
 so keep your promise and return Ayame!
 That’s right! Where is she?!
 Father!
 Aya…me?
 Ayame…is that you?
 Can’t you tell by looking?
 B-But Ayame is like…
 The food they make is so delicious, I overeat…
 Did I gain that much weight?
 Ayame!
 Ichiraku’s new menu?
 The thing we made at the cooking challenge?
 No, a diet ramen that’s popular among girls.
 Diet Ramen?
 It’s super popular!
 Oh, come on in, Naruto.
 You’ve regained your former shape…
 It’s thanks to my father’s diet ramen!
 Huh? Where's your father?
 Well… While he was joining me in eating the diet ramen…
 Hey… Naruto.
 That’s a little too thin, believe it.
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.
 Adventure, Lucky Day, Heart Beat, Rising,
 Decisive, Encounter, Life, Mutual Love
 Does anyone have anything to ask about this mission?
 I’ve got a question!
 Why should I have to go on a mission with this group?
 Okay, let’s move on. Everyone ready?
 Hey, I’ve got a question, believe it!
 As for the mission details,

 Even if you get lost, let’s start walking
 One more time
 Are you really happy
 when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
 Even if you change to who you really wanna be
 Will you always have a great smile?
 Dreaming of only “the beginning,” I wake up
 and someday, I'll live on my own.
 Yes, precious things are never in shape
 You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
 Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
 Even if you get lost, let's start walking
 One more time
 You shouldn’t lower your guard, Sensei.
 I’ll bury you and correct old mistakes, now!
 Whatever you do now, it’s too late… I’ve won…
 The Leaf Village will crumble!
 I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will of the First and Second Hokages…
 The Third Hokage!
 Orochimaru! Now I will perform an ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!
 Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
 Forbidden Secret Technique: Reaper Death Seal!
 A Jutsu I don’t know…
 Must hurry… This darkness is dangerous.
 I’ll have you show it to me.
 What’s the matter?
 Are you planning to be killed slowly by your predecessors?
 Please perform that Jutsu, quick.
 Not yet…?
 It looks like…I was just in time.
 What’s the matter? You’re already stumbling…
 Now all that’s left… is to catch them!
 I got you!
 I won’t let go!
 Appear!
 The darkness has disappeared… What’s this Jutsu?
 Sarutobi!
 I’m sorry…Sarutobi…
 We caused you trouble…
 Please forgive me…
 Lord First Hokage!
 Lord Second Hokage!
 Seal!
 Your own subordinates…!
 All members in the Leaf Village are a part of me.
 The villagers believe in me, and I believe in everyone.
 That’s what the Hokage is.
 Saru… Protect those who love the village and believe in you.
 And bring them up as individuals to whom you can leave the next era.
 As of tomorrow, you are the…
 Hokage!
 Toying with even the lives of your own subordinates…!
 Subordinates’ lives? Stop the endless nonsense!
 Didn’t these kids believed in you?
 Come! Enma!
 You’re mine!
 Striking Shadow Snake!
 Dang it! You little--!
 It’s over!
 What is this sensation…?
 This is bad…
 – Die! 					– Die!
 We have to hold them off here somehow.
 Isn't our back-up here yet?!
 This is out of our hands!
 Ninja Art: Summoning! Bring Down the House Jutsu!
 This Jutsu…
 Long time no see, Ibiki.
 Jeez, is that body the only thing that grew?!
 I can’t stand to look!
 Master Jiraiya…
 Jiraiya…! One of Sannin, the three legendary Shinobi?!
 Peeps, open up those little eyes of yours just this once and observe well.
 How wonderful!
 The devil region beyond heaven of Jiraiya, the fantastic sage Ninja…
 will rage!
 Snakes that have been antagonized by the frog. Begone!
 So that Orochimaru has finally started, eh?
 Where’s the Third Hokage?
 The Exam arena.
 I see…
 Don’t die…old man.
 Why…didn’t you dodge?
 Dang it!
 The Reaper Death Seal…
 In this Sealing Jutsu,
 in exchange for the effectiveness of Jutsu…
 one’s own soul is handed over to the Grim Reaper.
 It’s a Jutsu that costs your life…
 My Jutsu doesn’t activate…
 There’s no need to dodge. I will die, anyway.
 At the same time the Sealing ends, my soul will also be devoured.
 It’s a Jutsu of the hero who once saved this village.
 From now, you will also die… by this Jutsu!
 So this Jutsu also sealed that Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!
 And now, your soul will be dragged out… and sealed!
 My body…won’t listen to what I say!
 You’ll probably be able to see it soon.
 Your soul is also already about halfway out, so.
 Those who have their souls sealed by this Jutsu
 will suffer inside the belly of the Grim Reaper for eternity
 and will never attain peace…
 Those who seal and are sealed have their souls intertwined,
 and will hate each other, and continue to battle for eternity!
 What…?!
 This is… the Grim Reaper?!
 Knock it off! You old dotard! I won’t let you do as you like.
 Hurry up and…die!
 Okay, everyone. Line up!
 Quiet, everyone!
 Konohamaru!
 Konohamaru, it’s not going to collapse, is it?
 It’ll…it’ll be okay.
 The structure of this face rock path is old, but is of strong construction.
 My grandpa said so before.
 So it’ll definitely be okay.
 Someone’s coming!
 Which one…?
 Uchiha, huh?
 Then, what about Temari?
 Don’t run away like that…
 Fine.
 I’ll be your opponent this time.
 Wait!
 Temari!
 I assumed you’d been creamed by him.
 So you’re okay?!
 Yeah. Somehow…
 But…
 it didn’t turn out to be much of a delay.
 No, it’s time necessary for Gaara’s recovery.
 Besides, it’ll lead to his consumption of Chakra.
 This is…
 Shampoo, again?
 No, it’s Sasuke.
 There are several smells near him. He caught up…
 At last…
 Sasuke.
 He’s totally stopped moving.
 Is he going to fight with them?!
 Sasuke…
 Let’s hurry!
 What’s this clump of countless smells coming from another direction?
 Hey! There’s something besides us tracking Sasuke!
 What?!
 An enemy? An ally?!
 I don’t know. But…
 But?
 It’s not human.
 Huh?!
 Huh?!
 Go! Kankuro! I’ll take him again…
 Temari, you take Gaara and go on ahead.
 What?
 You’re at your limit…
 I don’t need a hindrance.
 But…!
 Go!
 Hurry up and go!
 Okay…
 It can’t be helped… I’ll be your opponent!
 Humph! I don’t care who it is!
 No!
 Your opponent is me!
 You…!
 Shino?
 Why are you here?!
 I put a female beetle on you before you left the arena.
 The females have almost no smell…
 Only a male can sniff out the subtle smell of the female.
 Though the male itself has a strong smell…
 Sasuke Uchiha… You pursue Gaara.
 Because the battle between you and him hasn’t been settled yet.
 I’ll fight him, because originally I was his opponent…
 I withdraw! Please go ahead with the match.
 Leave this to me here! Go!
 You’re very confident. But are you going to be okay?
 No need to worry.
 I’ll go back you up if I have just ten minutes.
 Humph. By then, I’ll be done too.
 None of you know anything at all.
 You guys probably don’t know of the real terror of this world.
 In that case… you’ll teach me that terror?
 No…
 If you defeat me and chase Gaara, you’ll be forced to know.
 That is, only if you can defeat me.
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 You who are strong… You who are called Uchiha…
 You who have friends… You who have a purpose…
 You who are like me…
 By killing you, I can truly exist!
 Uchiha, you are my prey!

210,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 A coup at the Land of Green…?
 Yes, it seems there’s no mistake.
 The retainers conspired with some men
 and began a rebellion…
 What happened to Naruto and the others?
 Speculating from their gathering point,
 they are around here.
 So they’ve already crossed the border…
 The large countries have agreed to make this
 a demilitarized zone.
 Considering Naruto and the other’s mission,
 they should be in a safe area…
 Are you sure?
 What do you mean…?
 Don’t you think the timing of this request
 strangely overlaps with the coup?
 Then you’re saying that Naruto’s mission is also related to this case?
 There is a possibility…
 But there’s no time to deal with Naruto at the moment.
 We have to take back the Land of Green
 from the rebels as soon as possible.
 If we leave it like this,
 the flames of the war will eventually reach other countries…
 True…
 Shizune, gather the free villagers
 and have them head to the Land of Green immediately!
 Yes, ma'am!
 You’ve done it now!
 What a persistent brat…!
 You shouldn't be able to stand anymore…
 Naruto!
 This is…nothing.
 What a surprise… you got some guts.
 Then, take this too!
 Ninja Art Magnet! Electromagnetic Illusion.
 Naruto!
 It’s useless! Your voice wouldn’t reach him!
 The human brain functions by
 a faint electric current running through it…
 If you receive my magnetic force powder,
 it’s going to alter your electric current and stop your thinking…
 That chain also has a strong magnetic force.
 Now, get buried!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay?
 Thank goodness…
 Hinata…run!
 I can’t leave you behind…
 He is…
 He’s someone that you can’t deal with…
 Naruto… I promise I’ll save you!
 Hinata!
 I’ll have you tell me where that girl is!
 Byakugan!
 Take this! Electromagnetic Illusion!
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
 What?!
 I see, so that is the Byakugan of the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 How interesting!
 What wonderful Taijutsu, but…
 I’ll crush it with my power!
 I did it…?!
 Yeah right… That level of Taijutsu will not work!
 It’s useless!
 This is bad…!
 You’re not much of a challenge. I’m disappointed!
 Now tell me! Where did you hide that girl?
 If you answer me, I’ll let you live… That boy too!
 If you rescue him right now, he wouldn’t die.
 Run…Hinata…
 Now say it!
 You don’t want to save that boy?
 Or do you think you could win against me?
 If I say it… Naruto would never forgive me.
 Then I’ll force you to talk!
 I’ll change the area behind you into a powerful magnet.
 I can change the position of the magnet according to your movement.
 So it's a waste to run away!
 That brat…
 She evaded the attack by throwing a paper bomb at that very instant.
 She’s pretty quick witted.
 But…
 I won’t let you go!
 Hinata…
 Naruto… I promise that I’ll return to rescue you…!
 But, there is a huge difference in power between him and me…
 I could never win against him!
 He’s already caught up to me… What should I do?
 This is…iron sand…?
 I see…his Jutsu can change his body
 and the things he touches into magnet.
 The reason why he didn’t attack back there
 was to brush off the iron sand from his body…
 If he doesn’t, he would sink in his iron sand.
 His attack pattern consists of alternating between
 Ninja Art Magnet and Iron Sand Genjutsu …
 He does this to turn his magnet powers on and off
 so his body won’t completely turn into a magnet.
 Then, there is one way to beat him!
 Now…play time is almost over!
 Now, it’s time you give up!
 I would never give up!
 Because that is my Ninja Way!
 What a waste…
 How dare you do that to Naruto!
 I will definitely not forgive you!
 Once you say where that girl is,
 why don’t you live with that brat in hell!
 Hey, don’t be shy and come closer!
 Right now!
 I’ll risk everything in this single attack!
 An attack that didn’t work before,
 will never work!
 Is…that right?
 What?!
 We're both going to hell!
 Let go, you!
 You brat! How dare you play around with me!
 I changed my mind. I’ll finish you off now!
 What is this?!
 Just now… I struck a Chakra Point
 that would make your Chakra flow go out of control.
 Now your body will just turn into a strong magnet…
 What…? That’s why you brought me to this sandy area?!
 S-Stop!
 I did it…Naruto…
 Damn…! I can’t move!
 The Human Boulder!
 Naruto!
 Choji…!
 Are you okay, Naruto…?
 Thanks…Yurinojou.
 So what happened?
 The second Janin attacked me and I got beaten up.
 What happened to Hinata and the princess?
 Oh yeah…!
 I can’t stay here!
 What…? What’s going on…? Naruto?
 Hinata is in danger!
 –Oh! Naruto! 					–Naruto!
 Hinata!
 Are you okay…Hinata?
 Hang in there, Hinata!
 N-Naruto… Choji…
 Yurinojou…
 You guys… you guys came to rescue me…
 Of course… We’re friends, right?!
 Yes!
 By the way, that magnet guy… Where did he go?
 He probably sunk into the sand…
 What?! You did it, Hinata?
 Yeah… I did my best…
 Hinata, you’re great…
 The guy that I couldn’t handle…
 You’re complimenting me?
 Naruto…
 Here…
 This is…my forehead band?
 The mission is not over yet.
 Naruto, please protect the princess… Princess Haruna.
 Hinata…
 I’ll promise you!
 I swear on this forehead band I will definitely protect the Princess!
 And…
 I can’t be losing against you!
 Naruto…
 Look after Hinata, Choji…Yurinojou!
 Right!
 Leave it to us…Naruto!
 Well, I’ll be darned.
 I can’t believe that Ruiga and Jiga were both defeated.
 Well, that saves some trouble though…
 Nobody has ever escaped from my Jutsu.
 Today will be a good day.
 Haruna! Where are you?!
 There she is!
 Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!
 Are you okay?
 I’m glad…
 I-It’s me, Princess Haruna!
 N-Naruto…
 I came to rescue you,
 but what is this treatment?
 Sorry…
 Why did you escape by yourself?
 I can’t count on you guys…
 I will try to survive no matter who's sacrificed…
 As long as I survive, the Land of Green can be revived.
 That’s the most important thing, right?!
 I am a victim!
 If I declare that other countries will lend me their power.
 If I take back the country and
 I, the true successor, become the feudal lord,
 then people will definitely gather and
 the Land of Green will return to the way it was!
 I don’t think so.
 You’re saying that the Land of Green won’t revive?
 I’m not saying that…
 But I just thought what if I lived in the Land of Green…
 If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou…
 I won’t guard a feudal lord like you!
 Naruto!
 What do you know?! What do you know about me?!
 What do you know about my life as a hostage?!
 Under watch 24/7,
 not even allowed to have my own free time,
 I was lonely everyday.
 Because of that lifestyle,
 I became sick and was in bed for a long time.
 I was finally able to return home after being close to dying…
 Naruto! If you’re saying that I’m wrong, then answer me!
 Were the things done to me
 in the name of protecting the Land of Green all wrong?!
 Then why did my father and mother send me away as a hostage?!
 Answer me! Naruto!
 I won’t count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I will go too.
 I promised Hinata that I will definitely protect you, princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought with the second Janin
 and got hurt badly....
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then, why do you concern yourselves with me?
 I…
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that, they probably won't chase us all the way there!
 Please be careful…
 No one uses this deer path.
 This should shake them…
 I found you!
 It’s impossible… to run away from me!
 Choji?!
 Don’t make useless efforts…
 I’ll make you guys my hostages!
 You guys take them back to the castle!
 Yes!
 If you wander around me
 you might get caught in my Jutsu and die.
 That’s it… We’re almost there!
 There’s no time to waste! Let’s go!
 Okay!
 Haruna!
 I’m okay!
 Oh no!
 Wh-What is this?!
 I see… You have good sense to dodge that attack!
 Who is it?! 					Where are you?!
 Here, over here!
 Too bad, but you guys won’t be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Damn! He is so troublesome!
 How dare he use many showy attacks.
 There is no way I can retaliate!
 I've gotta do something.
 At this rate, I’m gonna get cornered and shot.
 But even if I wanted to hide, Haruna’s legs are…
 Oh, damn it!
 What in the world should I do?!

211,"C'mon!
 Running like a fugitive,
 Being chased by something
 Inside my heart is pounding
 My throat dry like it's withering
 For no single one,
 To none does belong,
 This time is ours, right now...
 Unraveling the pain,
 Unraveling our hearts,
 Unraveling shadows
 Stifling our breath,
 Reaching for beyond,
 Tearing through the dark
 In fighting and in love
 To the distant light above,
 Yes, we are on the way
 I wanna rock...
 Rockin' my heart
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the first test of the Chunin Exam.
 You, from Hidden Sound Village!
 No doing as you please before the Exam!
 You want to be failed at the get go?!
 Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams, so we flipped out... despite ourselves.
 Hmph. This is a good opportunity,  so I'll say this.
 There will be no battles, competitions and the like
 without the permission of the proctors!
 And even if you get permission,
 actions that could lead to the death of an opponent will not be permitted.
 Any pig that screws with me will be disqualified immediately.
 Got it?!
 This Exam looks to be easy!
 Now then, we will start the first test of the Chunin Exam!
 Turn in your applications,
 take one of these number cards in exchange,
 and sit in the seat matching that number!
 After that, we will hand out the paper for the written test!
 Written...? Paper...?
 Paper...
 A paper test?!
 Start Your Engines: The Chunin Exam Begins!
 Everyone's seats are all scattered... What should I do?
 He's deflated, deflated...
 It's the worst type of test for Naruto...
 Naruto...
 Oh! You are Hinata...! Since when have you...?
 L-Let's both do our best.
 Y-Yeah.
 I didn't notice her at all.
 Hinata has no presence at all...
 There are several important rules to this first test.
 I will take no questions, so listen well accordingly!
 Rules? No questions will be taken...?
 First off is the first rule!
 You are given ten points each from the start!
 The written test has ten problems in all!
 Each problem is one point.
 And, this test is a point deduction system.
 You are deducted one point for each problem you get wrong!
 If you get three wrong, you'll have seven points!
 If I get ten wrong, I'll have zero points...
 The second rule.
 Pass or failure will be determined
 by the total points of the three-person teams.
 W-Wait a minute!
 What do you mean... total points of the teams?
 Shut up!
 There's a perfectly good reason for this!
 Shut up and listen!
 Reason...?
 If you've got it, here is the most important next rule!
 Those who are deemed by the sentinels
 as having committed an act of cheating or something similar to that...
 will have two points deducted  for each act.
 What...?
 Oh!
 In other words...
 there may be those who will be dismissed during this test
 without waiting for test grading.
 This means they're deducting points
 from things other than the written test problems.
 Know that those who commit awkward cheating...
 will bring ruin upon yourselves.
 I'll check you anytime.
 If you aspire to become a Chunin at all,
 know that Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
 Relax...! 					Yes... yes!
 Naruto aside, Sasuke and I are okay!
 Even if Naruto gets zero points... if we cover that...
 And, in the case of even one person on the team getting zero points...
 Everyone on that team will fail!
 Wha--?!
 What did he say...?!
 I feel two menacing stares...
 Naruto?
 By the way, the last problem will be given forty-five minutes
 after the start of the test!
 The time for the test is one hour.
 Begin!
 Could it...
 Could it be that, the fat is really on the fire now...?
 Naruto...! Just don't get zero points!
 Naruto isn't getting jitters from the get go, is he...?
 This is bad...
 As if!
 I know I've cleared many obstacles like this before...
 At times like this, one should look at all the problems
 without feeling pressed or making a fuss!
 And then with utmost effort
 I should tackle the problems that look easy to understand!
 Let's see, the first problem... is a code text, eh...
 Excellent, I say!
 Next! Next!
 Let's see... the second problem...
 The parabola B in the diagram illustrates the greatest possible distance
 Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken from a tree seven meters high...
 Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's character inferred
 from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,
 also answer the longest firing range in battle on flat ground
 and explain your basis.
 T-This is an... integrated problem based on predictions
 of uncertain conditions and dynamic energy analysis application...!
 There's no way Naruto can solve this!
 I mean...
 hardly anyone except me can solve this problem!
 Okay, next! 					Next!
 These other problems... are nothing but difficult ones.
 I see...
 I don't... understand even one of these problems.
 Oh, no, this is bad!
 For real! For real!
 What should I do? What should I do? What should I do?
 If about ten of all fifty-one teams are able to pass,
 it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself and get a considerable amount of points.
 It's like a system inviting cheating...
 I hope Sasuke and Naruto won't panic and cheat.
 It's okay... Naruto's not that much of an idiot...
 I know that...
 Don't panic...
 For now, all there is to do is to be very, very cautious...
 and cheat without being found out!
 No! No! I can't, that's no good, no good!
 I can't tread on such thin ice!
 At any rate, this elaborate fuss...
 It's like a trick assuming that we're going to cheat.
 They probably check with that paper...
 Somebody got nailed.
 Cheating deducts two points.
 Two-point deduction, huh...
 Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment the cheating was discovered...
 Know that those who commit awkward cheating
 will bring ruin upon themselves.
 Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
 I see, so that's how it is, eh.
 This wasn't just an achievement test!
 The real aim was...
 a test to see the ability for intensive information collection
 with the full use of deception and concealment techniques.
 ""Shinobi should read  the double bluff,"" eh...
 In other words, the true intention of the proctor is...
 if you're going to cheat, not ""awkward cheating,""
 but ""like exemplary Shinobi"", don't get caught.
 Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness of the point deduction system,
 the lenience of only deducting two points for each discovery of cheating makes sense.
 In other words,
 what's being tested here is how we can gather the correct answers
 without having our cheating detected by the proctors or
 by the one being cheated on.
 Realize it quick, Naruto!
 It'll turn into a fatal mistake!
 Realize it!
 This is bad. Believe it...
 If the purpose of this test is seeing the ability to gather information...
 then there should be someone in this classroom somewhere...
 who knows the answers to the problems!
 So Gaara has also started, eh...
 Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.
 Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru! Next is problem four!
 Judging from this rhythm...
 The stroke order... and the number of strokes...
 I see.
 Okay! Please tell me.
 Eight, huh.
 Lee, if you can see it, wear your headband!
 Time is rapidly going by!
 Oh, man! I'm afraid all there is to do is cheat...
 But, if I'm discovered,
 it'll be trouble for Sakura and Sasuke.
 On the other hand, if I get zero points...
 Sakura and Sasuke will be my companions in failure.
 Naruto...
 I'll show you... my test.
 Huh...?
 What is Hinata saying...?
 W-Why would she do such a thing for me?
 Could it be... some kind of trickery?
 But Hinata is not one to do something like that...
 No... But she might've been coaxed into attempting to trap me by Kiba and others...
 Hinata, let me ask you one thing!
 Huh?!
 Why would you show me?
 Uh... uh... actually...
 I...I...
 I don't want you, Naruto... to leave at this stage...
 Y-You see... the nine of us are the only rookies...
 and I have many anxieties about what's to come, so!
 I get it now! I was kind of strangely suspicious of you!
 Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!
 Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...
 W-What was that? I was about to turn...
 W-What was that for, sir?!
 You made five mistakes. You fail!
 N-No way...
 His two buddies, both of you get out of the classroom, right now.
 ♪ 23 fails!
 ♪ 43 and ♪27 fail!
 Noooo!
 Hey, hey! Do you have proof that I cheated five whole times?!
 Really, are you guys properly checking this number of people...?
 Listen up...
 Even among us Chunin, we're elite who were selected for this Exam.
 We don't overlook you blinking once...
 In a matter of speaking, this strength is the proof.
 Naruto...?
 Hurry... Look...
 Hinata... You don't get it, do you?
 What...?
 An awesome ninja like me won't cheat. Believe it!
 N-Naruto.
 B-But...
 Also, if something went wrong,
 you'd be in a hot spot for helping me cheat, right?!
 \What?!
 Naruto...
 I'm... sorry... I-I did something uncalled for...
 Nah, it's okay.
 I...went and acted big.
 What should I do? I'm extremely stupid.
 Byakugan!
 Sharingan!
 I'll copy all his movements!
 My hand is moving fluently...
 I hit the jackpot straight away with this guy.
 Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.
 I'm acknowledging that your smarts
 and the width of your forehead are exceptional.
 So you should thank me.
 Thank me for getting to be the target for this Jutsu.
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 So Ino... started using that Jutsu...
 There's no countering that spell of Ino's...
 Sakura, I let myself move into your mind for just a little bit.
 I have to memorize the answers quick.
 I've got to pass these answers to Shikamaru and Choji.
 ♪ 59! Fails!
 ♪ 33! ♪9!
 This is the thirteenth group to fail.
 ♪ 41 fails.
 ♪ 35, ♪62 fails!
 No way!
 That brat...
 He coolly proceeds through this ruckus without moving an eyelash.
 Very well done considering he's new.
 The optic nerves are connected...
 The third eye... open!
 Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...
 Dang it...!
 Excuse me.
 What is it?
 I need to go to the bathroom...
 We will accompany you to the bathroom.
 I see...
 Anyhow... the proctors are nothing so special!
 They don't realize that the proctors have increased by one...
 Eh, don't you think so...
 Crow...?
 Forty minutes have passed since the test started...
 Twenty minutes left... huh...
 Since it's come to this,
 it's the last problem to be given forty-five minutes after the start of the test.
 All there is to do is bet on this. Believe it!
 Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life once I get it wrong?!
 Really? Really? Really?
 If I don't take it, I'll fail with my comrades immediately?
 No way, no way, no way.
 The hopeless rule for problem ten!
 Not good, not good, not good.
 No way can I choose which one!
 What to do, do, do, do.
 This is seriously, seriously bad!
 Bad, bad, bad, bad.

212,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 What is it?
 Who are you?!
 It was you…? You killed him, didn’t you?
 N-No… I don’t know anything…!
 The Cursed Warrior…?
 The Cursed Warrior
 Old man’s…snot!
 I just can’t get myself into training doing it alone…
 I wonder if we won’t get a mission connected to Sasuke or something.
 The Land of Birds? From such a remote land…
 That’s what’s troubling us.
 The “Cursed Warrior” apparition has been disturbing the castle town
 and misleading the public, huh?
 So they want us to exterminate a ghost?
 I declined once saying we can’t go so far
 as to accept the extermination of a ghost, but…
 I must have you accept this at any cost. Please accept!
 Is it because the money isn’t enough?
 We in the Land of Birds are experiencing financial difficulties.
 Even this is the very limit the budget will allow…
 It’s not an issue of money.
 In other words, it’s the mission details.
 Be that as it may,
 indeed there isn’t even enough to cover travel expenses with this amount…
 Now that things have come to this pass…
 I shall commit harakiri…!
 Don’t be hasty!
 Yikes!
 It’s the little bit of pocket money I have saved up.
 I’ll pay out of my own pocket. So with this, please…!
 And that’s why you accepted it?
 It’s indulgent even for me…
 Nonetheless, most of the Jonin and Chunin are out on missions.
 I was thinking of how to handle this…
 I guess someone’s talking about you.
 Everyone’s busy with missions, so they don’t have time for such things.
 Who’s that guy…?
 He’s been like that since earlier.
 Even tasty ramen won’t go down the throat right being watched like that!
 Come inside and eat if you’re hungry!
 No, I’m not hungry…
 So? Tasty, huh?
 Yes!
 Thanks for your business.
 Come back and have Naruto treat you again…
 Again and again like that? Give me a break.
 Thank you for treating me. ln appreciation…
 N-No, you don’t need to worry about it…
 But hey, what’s your name?
 You’re not a familiar face from this village…
 Yes, my name is Chishima and I have come from the Land of Birds.
 I came to the Village Hidden in the Leaves to commission a mission…
 You’re flat broke even though you came as a messenger of your land?
 There wasn’t enough money for the commission,
 so I even used up my own pocket money…
 Then it must be a very important mission, huh?
 It might even cost an important friend of mine’s very life…
 Your friend…? What the heck do you mean?
 Ever since I was little,
 I was raised like a brother with Lord Sagi, the feudal lord of the Land of Birds…
 You’re friends with a feudal lord?!
 I said feudal lord,
 but he was only just appointed last year and actually he’s the same age as me.
 No kidding? Then he’s a totally young feudal lord.
 Y-Yes… The previous feudal lord, his father Lord Owashi died from illness
 and after that he even lost his twin sister…
 Ever since then,
 Lord Sagi, who was so cheerful, has become a totally different person…
 He wouldn’t show his face even if I visited…
 I’m worried about him as a friend rather than a feudal lord.
 I was thinking something might have happened to him…
 So if there is something I can do,
 I want to do whatever I can, as a friend…
 I couldn’t…save Sasuke. But this guy’s still…
 Leave it to me.
 What?
 Let’s save your friend!
 Right!
 Old Lady Tsunade! You’re mean!
 Listen, you could at least knock when entering my office.
 More importantly! What do you mean by fleecing bro of his pocket money
 and then not accepting the mission?!
 Huh?
 People call stuff like that devilish! You old lady devil!
 Try saying that again!
 I’m sorry!
 I wonder if Naruto…is okay…
 He’ll be fine.
 You’ve gotten to know a good guy…
 He may not look it, but he’s quite dependable.
 What?!
 R-Right…
 Who said I wouldn’t accept the mission?
 Oh, I see. So you were waiting for Neji to finish his mission and come back.
 Half-cocked jerk.
 Lee is on a mission with Guy.
 You and Tenten will form a three-man team with Neji as the leader, got it?
 Then did you hear from that kid about the mission details?
 Well actually, not yet…
 It’s the extermination of a ghost.
 A ghost?
 It seems that it appears when you’re walking through town at night…
 A ghost clad in white armor.
 That’s what you’ll…
 I-I didn’t hear anything about a ghost…
 Are you scared of it?
 I’m not scared. I couldn’t be a Ninja if I got scared at stuff like that!
 But does Ninjutsu work on ghosts?
 Who knows…?
 Try testing it out yourself.
 Jeez, why didn’t you say at the start
 that it was a commission to exterminate a ghost?!
 I didn’t tell you?
 Not even a word. But that’s just a rumor anyway, right?
 I haven’t seen it, but…
 See?
 But it seems my master, Lord Moso, saw it close up.
 F-For real?!
 The Land of Birds, huh…? That’s sure far…
 Village Hidden in the Leaves
 Land of Birds
 Umm, is there more…?
 You sure eat a lot considering you’re thin.
 I’m sorry. I’m often called a skinny voracious eater.
 Hey, by the way, is there really such a thing as the Cursed Warrior?
 There are people who say
 it’s the disembodied spirit of the previous feudal lord, Lord Owashi.
 The disembodied spirit of a dead feudal lord…
 Rather than ghosts,
 tell us a little more about the Land of Birds.
 Sure…
 The capitol of the Land of Birds stretches across the banks of the lake
 where migratory birds rest…
 It was a peaceful town with lots of green
 and where water from the lake would be drawn into the canals…
 However, after the sudden death of the previous feudal lord,
 there was much uproar.
 His son Lord Sagi and Lord Komei, the tactician from previously,
 were nominated to be the next feudal lord…
 But Lord Komei thought Lord Sagi was still too young
 and was vehemently opposed to him assuming the feudal lordship.
 But in the end, Lord Sagi took the seat of feudal lord
 and the matter was closed with Moso the high priest
 providing tutelage as a superintendent official…
 However, before even half a year passed,
 Lady Toki, his twin sister, died suddenly…
 After that, Lord Sagi who was so cheerful
 turned into a totally different person, became coldhearted
 and he now conducts governmental matters confined in his mansion…
 From about that time,
 the “Cursed Warrior” began appearing in the castle town…
 Those in the castle town say that Lord Owashi was killed by someone…
 There are even those who say that the Cursed Warrior
 is the ghost of Lord Owashi searching for the person
 who drove him to death and is attempting to have his revenge…
 That’s scary…
 There’s no such thing as ghosts.
 But…
 That priest Moso is the one
 who gained the most from Owashi’s death, huh…?
 Lord Moso is a magnificent person of virtue with no self-interests!
 Then the suspicious one is…
 The only one left is Komei the tactician!
 I bet he assassinated Owashi
 in an attempt to become the feudal lord, but failed!
 He has complained whenever opportunity offered itself,
 after Lord Sagi became the feudal lord as well!
 A tactic like tormenting Lord Sagi by starting the rumor
 about the Cursed Warrior might be a piece of cake for Lord Komei…!
 All right! There’s no doubt.
 It’s settled. The true identity of the Cursed Warrior is Komei!
 The true identity of the ghost is revealed, huh…?
 Lord Komei, there was nothing unusual on the scheduled patrol.
 You may step down…
 Yes, sire.
 Aren’t we at our destination yet?!
 Just a little further until Lord Moso’s residence.
 Where is he?! This way?
 Where did he go?!
 Th-There he is!
 Get him! Drag him down!
 Cursed Warrior!
 He vanished.
 Lord Komei! Are you all right?!
 I’m fine. Don’t panic!
 What’s that?!
 It’s flying?!
 Clad in white armor, possesses a halberd,
 and wears a mask with a frightening look…
 There’s no doubt… lt’s the Cursed Warrior!
 After him!
 Are you going to ride on my shoulders forever?
 Wait here! I’ll pin down the true identity of the ghost!
 Huh? R-Right…
 Where’d he go?!
 Over there!
 Byakugan!
 I can’t see him…
 What does that mean?!
 There’s no human presence in here…
 At least, a living presence…
 Wh-Why do you put it that way…?
 Shh! Didn’t you hear something just now?
 I thought you didn’t feel a human presence!
 I told you…living presence.
 Wh-What do you want?!
 Damn it, damn it.
 You little!
 Chain Weight!
 Th-There can’t be something like ghosts. No such things as ghosts!
 Stop, Naruto! He’s…!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 U!
 Zu!
 Ma!
 Ki!
 Naruto Barrage!
 Yes!  Now I’ll verify the true identity!
 This is…
 The insides are empty.
 That means…
 it’s a real ghost!
 So many things happen on this endless road, huh?
 Although you’re strong-willed, your voice wavered on the phone today
 What dreams did you chase to get here?
 Even I have times when I just don’t understand, baby
 When you’re sad, I’ll be close to you
 Even on nights when we’re apart, I’ll be close to you
 I’ll be close to you
 So that’s Sagi, the feudal lord of this land, huh?
 He’s far away, but he might be quite cool.
 Shh, be quiet!
 What is it, Neji?
 Something’s strange. What’s with this blood thirst?
 What? Bloodthirsty? Could it be assassins?
 They might be Shinobi. ls everyone ready?!
 – Yeah. 					– Yeah.
 I’ll protect the feudal lord!

 A Dubious Offer! Tsunade's Choice
 Not good…
 Dang it! Dang it! This time for sure…no matter what!
 You’re the only one who can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arms.
 Why don’t we make a deal?
 I’ll resurrect the little brother and man, both of whom you loved…
 with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.
 Don’t you want to see those two, Tsunade…?
 No! You must not believe in their sweet talk…
 Their wishes… Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
 And dreams… Did you forget them?!
 I’ll be straight with you.
 Tsunade, the village has demanded that you become the Fifth Hokage.
 The successive line of Hokages
 have protected the Leaf Village and those living in it.
 They brought troubled times under control
 and helped the village to prosper.
 They risked their lives for this dream, this ideal!
 You don’t have to answer right now.
 However, I want it in a week.
 Also, two human sacrifices are needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,
 so do what you need to do to prepare them.
 We are starting!
 C’mon. Place your bets!
 Which will you bet on, ma’am?
 Which one? C’mon!
 Which one will she choose?
 If she agrees to our conditions,
 your arms will be healed,
 and the destruction of the Leaf Village will continue immediately.
 Lady Tsunade will also be able to be reunited with the two whom she loves.
 But if she doesn’t agree…
 I’ll have to force her to heal my arms…
 Will it really be that easy?
 I have you.
 There’s no need to worry.
 I’m the one who knows her the best.
 And her greatest weakness!
 She’ll definitely accept the conditions… Definitely!
 Listen, in this third step,
 you’ve got to use 100% of what you have learned…
 And retain them.
 In other words,
 imagine creating a single layer within the balloon
 and compressing the Chakra inside it.
 I know that in my head…
 But no matter what,
 I can’t completely hold 100% of my power in a neat ball…
 Don’t give him false hope by teaching him something he can't master.
 That’s why the moony kid starts joking about becoming a Hokage!
 Tomorrow, huh.
 Come again, okay?
 I certainly will!
 Are you going to meet Orochimaru again?
 To think she’d be that shaken up…
 Something extreme must have happened.
 That one week bugs me, somehow…
 And Naruto hasn’t come back to the inn for nearly a week.
 I guess I’ll press Tsunade a little more.
 No good…
 No good… Why?
 Here there’s no time… lt’ll be too late.
 What’s this…?!
 What happened, Naruto?!
 Are you okay?
 What do you want?
 The moon’s out.
 How about going out for a drink?
 Tomorrow will be the one week you promised to Naruto.
 I wonder what became of Naruto?
 Beats me.
 I guess I’ll have something.
 Radish, please.
 Coming up.
 Oh?
 Here you go.
 Ooh! This looks good.
 Lady Tsunade!
 What happened to Naruto?
 He’s quite exhausted and weakened.
 And his right hand is severely burned with Chakra…
 As it stands now,
 this kid probably won’t wake up until the day after tomorrow.
 It’s as Jiraiya says…
 Why did I make such a stupid bet?
 What am I, of all people, getting so worked up for?
 How stupid.
 Tomorrow…
 Please don’t go tomorrow!
 Why don’t you say anything?!
 Lady Tsunade! Please don’t be silent. Please answer!
 If you say that you’re going…
 What will you do?
 I’ll stop you with my life!
 Shizune… Have you forgotten who you’re talking to?
 Sir! It’s morning, now! lt’s about time you went home!
 Geez.
 Hey! Get up, sir…
 Hey! What’s wrong, you?!
 It’ll be troublesome if we’re disturbed during the negotiations…
 What do you want me to do?
 It might be good to kill… Tsunade’s attendant.
 It seems that you…
 You don’t trust me completely…yet.
 Precisely because I trust you…
 I would like to leave Sasuke in your hands.
 Well, then…
 Kabuto…
 If you wish to stop me…
 You have no choice but to kill young Sasuke, now.
 You can’t possibly kill me…
 Hey!
 I said hey!
 Naruto…?
 Oh no! What time is it? No, what day is it?
 It’s Monday…
 What is it?
 Is your body okay?
 As I recall, you were supposed to sleep for two full days…
 No matter what the wound,
 I’m always able to recover if I sleep one night!
 That’s right. This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 More importantly, where’s that stupid old woman?!
 Today’s the promised bet day.
 Then, what about the Jutsu…
 It’s still not complete, but I can wing it… Believe it!
 That’s right. This isn’t the time for this.
 – Naruto, please stay… – Huh?
 You are…!
 What?! Oh!
 Wait, Shizune!
 That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.
 I can’t build up my Chakra well…
 And my body is so numb, I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.
 What was he gonna do if that had hit me?!
 That’s lame! Here you’re always bragging about how you’re this awesome Ninja!
 And you’re nailed by her perverted attack? You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!
 Shut up!
 Even if she’s rotten, she’s still a medical specialist.
 She’s the only one who could concoct a tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.
 But to think I’d be caught off-guard,
 no matter how intoxicated I was…
 I’m going to kill you, bastard!
 How are you feeling, Master Jiraiya?
 Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.
 But be that as it may, maybe around thirty percent…
 I never thought I’d end up encountering that Master Jiraiya in a place like this…
 Things have gotten difficult. I guess I’ll pull back for now.
 At any rate, Naruto… To think you’d be here, too…
 Hey! Shizune.
 Y-Yes?!
 It’s about time you tell me
 what the heck she was talking about with Orochimaru.
 Orochimaru?!
 I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade…
 That’s why I couldn’t say until now.
 But…
 There’s no time. Please come with me!
 I’ll explain as we run!
 Okay!
 I’m going, too!
 What’s your answer?
 Say what?!
 The answer to that is definitely no!
 This might be really bad…
 She’s probably still thinking of those two.
 Perhaps I may have no choice, but to kill Tsunade…
 Dang it!
 I’ll heal your arms…
 In exchange for that, keep your hands off the village.
 Very well.
 Now then…
 He’s planning to once again attack
 the Leaf Village if his arms are healed!
 The situation will get even more dangerous than that
 if he’s not stopped now.
 Him screwing around like that!
 I have you. There’s no need to worry…
 What’s the meaning of this?
 To think you’d betray me at this point…
 Tsunade!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 What the hell is this?! This castle has been destroyed even further!
 It seems Tsunade has declined the deal.
 But…but the old lady is not here!
 Calm down a second. She shouldn't have gone far from here.
 Oh, some incredible noise from that direction, Pervy Sage!
 Well, well…she started a flashy battle.
 Naruto, we go after her!
 Right! I'm ready anytime!

214,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 It looks like the preparations are complete.
 So this is the Land of Greens you were talking about, brother?
 Well, it’s a small land,
 but it could be a good stepping-stone for getting ahead in the world.
 We’ve already bought off half of the public officials.
 This land will be overturned on our signal.
 As of today, we’re the feudal lords of this land.
 Feudal lords, huh…?
 That has a nice ring to it.
 Open for Business! The Leaf Moving Service
 This is a problem…
 I thought about testing out various combinations, but it backfired.
 With these remaining members, there’s nobody who can take the lead…
 But it’s merchant protection this time,
 so no matter who goes, there probably isn’t much to worry about.
 Mission difficulty isn’t the issue.
 It’s a commission from the Land of Greens.
 I wanted to send them a respectable team.
 The lord of the castle there was good to me in the old days!
 True indeed…
 He generously assumed the debts for the bundle you blew on gambling.
 It’s small, but it’s a nice and easygoing land.
 There was an adorable princess, and two boy Ninja looked after her…
 At that time, they both said they’d marry me…
 I wonder if they still feel that way…
 I don’t think so.
 I bet they’ve all gotten big…
 We’ll be at the border soon.
 This is our last look at this scenery for a while.
 All right! A mission, a mission!
 Wait up, Naruto!
 Everyone else was off on missions,
 but I've been doing nothing but odd jobs in the village!
 I was sick of hearing stories about everyone’s adventures.
 Still, we’re guarding merchants this time.
 It ‘s probably not something to brag about.
 Then I should exaggerate the story a bit
 and say that I took out about a thousand bandits, right?
 That’s just lying…
 Oh! There they are. That’s them!
 Yahoo!
 Who’re you?
 You guys are merchants from the Land of Greens, right?
 That’s right.
 We’ve come from the Village Hidden in Leaves
 to protect you guys. Believe it.
 The Village Hidden in Leaves?
 See…? 					This, this.
 We were told to protect you from mountain bandits…
 It’s for certain.
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki.
 And this is Hinata.
 I’m Choji Akimichi.
 Um, we received one more item from the Hokage
 to identify ourselves with.
 Hey, Momiji.
 Give it back.
 Oh, it’s true.
 These people are from the Village of the Hidden Leaf.
 See…? 74.01	01:30:15:10	01:30:17:11	The Leaf Moving Service
 Wh-What’s that?
 Old lady Tsunade… she’s done it this time!
 I see.
 I’m Kikusuke.
 This is Yurinoshin.
 He’s Shun.
 I’m Momiji! We’ll be counting on you movers!
 You sure eat a lot.
 That’s why you're so f…
 Fa?!
 …full figured.
 For you.
 I love people with great strength.
 Something like this is a cinch.
 See? Watch.
 Roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll…
 Somebody help me!
 That Choji, getting all carried away.
 Move faster, mover.
 We’re rapidly falling behind.
 We’re not movers, I’m telling you.
 Why don’t you help out before complaining?!
 No, it’s fine.
 Our cousin Shun is in poor health.
 You don’t need to worry, Kikusuke, Yurinoshin.
 I had no intention of listening to anything
 this good-for-nothing has had to say from the start.
 Who’s a good-for-nothing?! Just you watch!
 Honestly, it’s because you push yourself too far…
 I’m sorry… Shun’s being unreasonable.
 Water! 					Oh.
 Mine’s empty, too.
 Then there’s some fresh drawn water.
 Here!
 Wow, how’d you find water in a place like this?
 My grandma taught me.
 Your grandma?
 It's this…
 You can tell with this.
 What?! 					With those?
 It’s called dousing.
 If you concentrate on the item you’re looking for…
 these rods will react to that item and will inform you when you're near it.
 It’s knowledge passed on from our predecessors.
 When I get back to the village,
 maybe I'll try to find money that people dropped with that.
 Tasty!
 It doesn’t compare to the water in the Land of Greens, but it's good water.
 Come to think of it, what kind of place is the Land of Greens?
 The Land of Greens is… a small land deep in the mountains.
 Everyone in the land loves nature and is warm-hearted.
 It was indeed Shangri-La…
 Was…?
 Oh, it’s nothing…
 But, you know, if it’s such a great place, why do you need protection?
 It’s targeted because the people take peace for granted!
 What do you mean by that?
 Stuff like loving nature and being warm-hearted sounds nice.
 But the bottom line is that the people in the Land of Greens are all softhearted.
 We live in a troubled time now.
 Something like believing in people is ridiculous.
 Hey, the Land of Greens is not something to speak ill of like that.
 The lord of the castle there was kind even to us merchants passing through.
 To think he’d take up that kind of attitude with an old lady…
 He’s kind of disagreeable.
 He’s your cousin, right? Do something about him.
 R-Right.
 He’s probably a bit touchy from the bad things that have happened.
 I’m sorry…
 Oh, i-it’s okay…
 Hey, that’s dangerous.
 It’s dangerous to wander around alone.
 Brother Choji, look at that…
 Naruto!
 What is it?
 That.
 Wh-What is that?
 That’s in the direction of the Land of Greens, right?!
 I’m going to go check it out… You take the others and go on ahead.
 I’ll be right back.
 Listen.
 What we saw here is a secret.
 We don’t want everyone to get worried.
 Yeah. 					Got it.
 Huh? Where’s Naruto?
 Th-The bathroom…
 I’ll give this to you if you tell me what you saw earlier.
 Black smoke… 					was rising.
 Black smoke…?! 					From where?
 The direction of the Land of Greens.
 Lord Shun…
 It’s finally…
 I should be at the Land of Greens border pretty soon.
 Wh-What was that …? There was no presence at all.
 Who’re you guys!
 Who’re you guys?
 That headband. You’re with the Hidden Leaf Village, right?
 So what if I am? Why are you targeting me?
 I have no intention of fighting you guys.
 It seems the ones we are looking for are heading this direction, you see.
 Those who prowl around here will die.
 Did we do it…?
 The Substitution Jutsu?!
 The real one is over here!
 These guys are pretty good.
 Two left.
 One of them is the real one!
 What?!
 Too bad! Those two are also clones.
 I’m going to turn back for now…
 Choji! Hinata!
 How’d it go, Naruto?
 Actually, there’s trouble…
 Guys! Let’s take a break here for the time being!
 Pursuers from the Land of Greens?
 They said that…
 The ones they were looking for were headed in this direction.
 But why would Ninja be after this group?
 These people are just merchants, aren’t they?
 And they’re not even people from the Land of Greens to begin with…
 Now that you mention it, that’s right.
 But what will we do?
 We’re going to engage them if they come, of course.
 That might be impossible…
 We have elderly people and children with us.
 You’re right…
 I know.
 It could be that they’re not chasing after us!
 What do you mean by that?
 Basically, we’re moving in the same direction as their true target
 and we could just be in their battle ground…or something.
 I see.
 That means if we clear the path, they’ll let us go right by.
 Alright.
 Listen up, guys!
 Some kind of troublesome guys are heading this way.
 Troublesome guys?
 Naruto, I think everyone will feel anxious if you say it like that.
 I-I see…
 But you don’t need to worry.
 They’re probably not after us…
 It’ll kind of be the long way around,
 but we’ll make it through if we take a little side turn up ahead.
 Does this feudal lord really have this little?
 He’s a feudal lord who’s a prestigious ruler of virtue.
 So he would never line his pockets.
 But we’ll squeeze out a big pile from now on.
 More importantly, has the young girl in question been found?
 Nope…
 But the two who were tracking her got attacked.
 We know the direction she fled in.
 That young girl just would not be good.
 If they get away, they may return with forces from other lands.
 If the sun were a little stronger,
 I could burned down a whole mountain with my Jutsu…
 Then I’ll go…
 Lord Renga, I gathered all collaborators in the hall as you ordered…
 Oh, good work.
 Without your guys’ help, we couldn’t have brought down the castle this easily …
 Then brother, shall we go for the hall greeting?
 Okay… I’ll take care of things here.
 So, about the thing you promised…
 Oh, that’s right.
 Take as much there as you like.
 Really?
 Honestly. It’s so easy to deceive softhearted people…
 It really is exactly so.
 Our lord believed in us until the very end…
 Come on.
 If you stuff that much in there, the ferry on death’s river will sink.
 I make it a habit not to believe in people.
 Especially people who have betrayed someone once…
 Y-You’re joking, Lord Renga…
 It’s no joke.
 C-Could it be that you had me gather the collaborators in the coup to…
 You’re also softhearted!
 That should do it.
 Yurinojou, it seems they’re after us.
 Yes.
 I leave Lady Haruna to you.
 What are you going to do?
 If we wait here for their attack, there will be too many to defend.
 Since it’s come to this, I’ll slow them down.
 But according to the information,
 they are three Janin who use unknown Jutsu.
 I know.
 But my Jutsu will not be defeated by the likes of them.
 Very well.
 Go, Kikunojou.
 Yes, Lady Haruna.
 Naruto.
 I set a trap for the time being.
 Jeez, Hinata. You’re such a worrywart.
 You don’t need to go that far.
 Huh? Yurinoshin, where’s Kikusuke?
 You’re right. 					Since when…?
 Oh, he had some other business and went on ahead…
 Say what? Taking liberties like that is really a problem…
 Oh, I see.
 So that’s it, huh?
 What is it?
 Even Kikusuke makes sure to go to the bathroom.
 Naruto…!
 Lady Haruna, I shall protect you  with my life!
 There!
 Who’re you…?!
 I’m Ruiga.
 To think you’d just come right on out nonchalantly.
 Then she must in that group, right?
 If it’s one against one, I won’t lose to a hired Ninja like you!
 Can you do it?
 Have a taste of the Land of Greens’ Flower Ninja Art!
 Eat this! Flower Shuriken! Flying Flowers: Falling Foliage!
 Too easy…
 I don’t know about that!
 Flower Ninja Art: Release! Myriad of Flowers!
 Ninja Art: Mirror Flower Water Moon!
 Flowers made of Letter Bombs, huh? Futile, futile!
 And Genjutsu next, huh?
 This is the finishing blow.
 Flower Ninja Art: Bloom! Myriad of Flowers!
 Too bad.
 The Ninjutsu of a Flower Ninja can’t beat me.
 Now it’s my turn!
 Eat this.
 Water Style: Liquid Memory!
 Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.
 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 A running-ramen strategy, huh?
 In other words, we split up in order to avoid annihilation, right?
 With this, the protection burden will decrease.
 But won’t the soup spill if it runs?
 This is an example.
 It’d still be trouble even if it’s just an example, believe it.
 Then, let’s make it the running-ramen-with-a-lid strategy.
 If you say so, Naruto.
 I mean, do you really understand the strategy, Naruto?

215,"I want to try and gather the unrestrained winds
 I’ll run toward the horizon, alongside the wave crests
 I’ve made my decision,
 even if there’s a long way to go on that road.
 I’ll continue towards the future I’ve planned
 Time rushes us The heartbeat speeds up
 When I woke in the middle of a dream I kept searching for that same light
 Under the shining star-lit sky with countless constellations and shadows
 There was something beyond that… What were you gazing at?
 What were you gazing at?
 I’m exhausted!
 Important solo mission, my butt!
 They just didn’t have enough manpower for the castle restoration.
 That’s not the job of a Shinobi.
 Ow-ow… I won’t hold up if I don’t rest somewhere.
 Oh!
 I’ll take a bath. Here I go!
 Hey… I’m sounding like an old man.
 Wh-What?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Thank you.
 Who the heck are you, mister?
 I’m a Delivery Ninja!
 Please, Mr. Postman!
 23, 24, 25…
 26…
 No mistake…
 Thanks to you Mister Naruto, all of the postal articles are safe.
 By the way, what’s a Delivery Ninja?
 We are postal professionals who risk our lives
 to deliver the important parcels our customers have left with us.
 In other words, you’re a postman.
 I am a Delivery Ninja!
 Ordinary postmen don’t risk their lives.
 So you’re an awesome postman, huh?
 That’s right.
 Oops, I must not keep my customers waiting.
 Then, I’ll be on my way…
 Mister! What’s your name?!
 I’m 596-03.
 A zip code…?!
 Anywhere would be fine if I can get in a hot spring…
 Cripes… Here it’s still day time and…
 That voice…
 My, you’re a strange one, Jira-chan.
 Am I?
 Ah, Pervy Sage!
 What?! Who’s a Pervy Sage…?!
 What’s the meaning of this, Pervy Sage?!
 Hadn’t you left the village on an important mission?
 That’s why I was being patient about you training with me!
 If you’ve got the free time to be doing something like this,
 help out with my training right now!
 W-Wait, Naruto. There’s a reason for this…
 You probably have some glib lies about gathering information or something.
 You’re wrong, you’re wrong. lt’s data collection, data collection…
 You see…
 It’s my final spurt
 for the manuscript of the final volume of “Make-Out Violence.”
 What about the mission…?
 Well, you see, I’m on a mission.
 So don’t worry…
 What kind of mission?
 As it happens, I received information that a member of the Akatsuki Organization
 will be visiting this town the day after tomorrow.
 The Akatsuki Organization! Then, that Itachi will be…?
 I don’t know that. And the same goes for their purpose…
 But that’s a matter until the day after tomorrow.
 And so, I’m making effective use of the free time!
 Then it’s perfect. Give me some training!
 Well… you see, they’re so insistent about the manuscript.
 I ended up promising the publisher that I’d send it today or tomorrow.
 Come on! It’s a long-awaited chance for training.
 If my manuscript were to be completed early,
 I might be able to take some time for training.
 Oh, my shoulders are stiff!
 There, there.
 Oh, I’m thirsty!
 Here you go.
 Hot!
 Hey, the ideas I just about had have blown away!
 Enough!
 I’m taking a bath!
 What a hard Sensei to please…
 I bet he’s going to say this is data collection, anyway.
 We must deliver that secret document
 to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs, no matter what the cost…
 It seems this is where the Delivery Ninjas always stay.
 Oh, they could…
 Delivery Ninja?
 I can see them now.
 This is all I need for my writing desire to well up…
 I’m not getting…inspired with this…
 Imagining with your head is a writer’s job, isn’t it?
 I’m a writer rooted in realism! Getting a picture is important.
 So I wonder if you’d do that for me.
 Can you write if I do that?
 I’ll write, I’ll write!
 Sexy Jutsu: Steam Bath Harem Version!
 – Master Jiraiya. Jiraiya! – This is great!
 Won-der-ful!
 What a hopeless guy!
 He hasn’t been able to write at all!
 Address, check! Zip code, check--!
 Ow-ow-ow…
 Oh, the sealed documents…
 Please take extra care with this.
 I will take it for you.
 Ow-ow-ow…
 Excuse me, can I also ask you to take this for me?
 Oh! Mister Naruto. Thank you for helping me out yesterday.
 Oh! Mister!
 I am 596-03.
 It’s hard to remember!
 More importantly, I want to ask you to take care of this!
 Hmm…This goes in a different direction…
 Have a heart. Please.
 Oh, perfect timing.
 Huh?! Is this a Shadow Clone?
 He is 463-72.
 This area should be in your jurisdiction.
 It is.
 Then I leave it to you… What was it again?
 I am 463-72.
 Hurry, okay?
 Wake up…
 Whoa! I fell asleep!
 Pervy Sage, let’s start training!
 What’re you talking about? I must complete the manuscript…
 You don’t need to worry about that.
 I wrote the manuscript and sent it to the publisher!
 So now you can devote yourself freely to training…
 Right, Pervy Sage?
 You idiot!
 Huh?
 If something like this were read, it’ll be the end of my writing career!
 Ah… Oh… I’m sorry.
 You said you sent it to the publisher, right? How?
 I gave it to a Delivery Ninja in the inn…
 D-Delivery Ninjas.
 You mean, the one that delivers any parcel to the addressee, no matter what…
 not influenced by any land or institution… that iron organization?!
 After him, Naruto.
 We’ll chase down the Delivery Ninja, no matter what…
 and retrieve your manuscript at any cost!
 If he’s going to the publisher, he should definitely take this path.
 Now what’s left is how to close the time gap…
 I hear the leg power of Delivery Ninjas is extraordinary, though…
 Pervy Sage!
 Slow down the pace a little, man.
 Naruto! This is also training!
 To be straight, you’re short on leg power!
 A Ninja must apply oneself,
 connecting this with training, no matter what the situation!
 Excellent, Pervy Sage. Now you’re talking!
 It’s just like a maze!
 We’re totally lost…
 If we had Hinata’s or Neji’s Byakugan at a time like this…
 Byakugan! I didn’t think of that!
 That’s the Rasengan, isn’t it?!
 I’m sorry!
 Uh, no, you see…!
 This isn’t the time to be drooling!
 There he is!
 After him, Naruto.
 R-Right!
 Thieves!
 Hey, wait!
 There’s no fool who’d wait after being told to wait!
 As it happens,
 the parcel this person here left with you this morning is a slip-up!
 That’s right!
 I have no knowledge of that.
 The rule for us Delivery Ninjas
 is to deliver parcels once left with us to the destination,
 even if we have to risk our lives!
 My life as a writer is also at risk!
 Don’t look at me.
 This is trouble!
 Sorry.
 To do that to someone who’s doing honest work…
 Shut up! When you get right down to it, it was you who…
 Huh?! What’s this?!
 This isn’t the thing you wrote!
 Oh!
 That time! It got switched with my manuscript!
 Say what?!
 This is…a secret document directed
 to the feudal lord of the Land of Fangs from the Land of Claws…
 Let me see… According to the information I’ve gotten,
 the Fang and the Claw could go to war at any moment…
 This is a secret document for peace!
 They’ve decided on peace?! lt’s written here.
 That’s a good thing, isn’t it?! War is no good!
 You! You idiot! The fact that this secret document is here means
 the manuscript you wrote is being taken to the Land of Fangs!
 What’ll happen if they read it as a secret document
 from the Land of Claws?
 This is bad! No doubt, war will begin!
 We’re going to the Land of Fangs!
 R-Right!
 This time for sure we’ll take back the manuscript!
 Postal thieves… my customer’s important parcel…!
 This is bad!
 This is 463-72. This is 463-72!
 A postal robbery has occurred!
 The thieves are a pair,
 a large man with a perverted look and a kid!
 ""They appear to be after 596-03’s parcel.""
 ""Members in the area are assigned to protect 596-03!""
 ""Stop the thieves in the name of the Delivery Ninja!""
 The only way to get to the Land of Fangs is to go up this river.
 More than likely they will also go by boat.
 Then depending on our speed, there’s a chance we’ll catch up.
 I’m the one who’s got it rough.
 You don’t have enough physical strength!
 Consider this also as training and apply yourself!
 That again?!
 Who’re those guys?!
 It appears reinforcements have been summoned.
 Hurry, Naruto!
 Naruto! Switch places!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 Somehow…the Rasengan looks like a really cheap Jutsu…
 It’s for the sake of preventing a war!
 Our mission of peace is at stake!
 – Right! 					– Switch.
 Huh?
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 Rasengan!
 That’s it!
 Hey, wait! It’s a slip-up! This is the real one!
 They got switched during the commission!
 Delivery Ninja old man, it’s the truth!
 I’m sorry.
 According to our rule, we are never to look inside
 a customer’s parcel we have taken on, no matter what.
 If that passes over to the Land of Fangs,
 there will be war!
 Even if that were the case, I must not break the rule.
 You’re impossible!
 It’s the Land of Fangs!
 All we do is carry out our duties!
 Then…we’ll take it away by force if we have to.
 – Postal delivery! – Postal delivery!
 Naruto! Do you know which one it is?!
 No, I don’t!
 I am 596-03.
 I know! It’s 596-03!
 Where is he?!
 Up there!
 Naruto, you hold back the front! I’ll rout the rest!
 Got it!
 I won’t let you go past here!
 In the name of the Delivery Ninja,
 I will not let anyone interfere!
 You’re an impressive old man…
 I too, in the name of the Leaf Ninja,
 will take away the manuscript with a Jutsu!
 Let’s go!
 Harem Jutsu! Riverside Mad Dance!
 Mis-ter De-li-very Nin-ja.
 No, no! This isn’t the time to be doing something like this.
 Now, to get cracking with my delivery.
 Deliver…
 I will deliver.
 Hey, where are you going? Play with me.
 No, no! Not that way.
 I’ll do my best!
 Guys! Give me a hand!
 – Right! Yeah. 					– Okay!
 P-P-Postal delivery.
 Okay, good work.
 This guy’s iron will is the real deal…
 We’re too late, huh…?
 Is war going to start?!
 Th-This is--!
 It’s a manuscript of the latest issue of the Make-Out series!
 That Land of Claws feudal lord…!
 To think he’d know I was a big fan of the Make-Out series!
 Everyone!
 Stop the fighting!
 Send a messenger to the Land of Claws!
 Don’t let anybody in…
 I kind of don’t really get it, but… with this, there’ll be no war?
 No war is fine…
 But does this mean my writing power is the same as Naruto’s scribbling…?!
 Now then!
 Today’s the day the Akatsuki Organization guy comes!
 We’ll capture him no matter what and get information about Sasuke…
 Pervy Sage?
 Sorry, Naruto. There was a development while you were sleeping.
 I will pursue the Akatsuki Organization as is.
 I’ve been had!
 Well… I suppose it made for some good training…
 The wind blows, Ah…
 The pain, The memories won’t disappear
 What should be brought along?
 Assemble them into a piece.
 There is no second chance, never
 How foolish it is to throw away
 Acting so innocently, Ah…
 The images.
 It probably will not end
 It probably will not end
 Burn that love-filled heart,
 Sail across a thousand dreams
 Running freely
 To take hold of the world in hand
 The clouds scatter
 The sun sets yet again
 The solo parade begins to move.

 We’re heading for the Village Hidden in Stars
 on a mission to protect a mysterious star.

 You okay, Kiba?
 Yeah…
 Is this also Genjutsu…?!
 No one, including Akamaru, can escape from Yakumo’s Genjutsu.
 It’s because…
 we have an enlarged neural tube… the cerebrum…
 Guys, move away from the door!
 Parasitic Insects.
 Please, Sensei… Tell me the truth.
 If you don’t…I’ll rub you out…
 I reached the decision to seal your Genjutsu power
 at my own discretion.
 It has nothing to do with the Third Hokage…
 Vent your resentment…
 The only one you should hate is me…
 I heard…!
 I heard you and the Third Hokage talking
 about trying to destroy the Kurama Clan!
 Yakumo, you’ve got the wrong idea.
 You lie!
 No way could my mother and father die in just a fire!
 My parents were killed…!
 What?!
 Shino…
 What’s this?!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 All right!
 I’m counting on you guys!
 –Right! 					–Right!
 Now, I’m ready when you are…
 One, two…
 Charge!
 Go!
 N-Naruto…
 Naruto?!
 Kurenai Sensei! What happened to your…?
 Yakumo, did you do this…?
 That person tried to eliminate me…
 So she’s just facing the consequences.
 You’re wrong!
 Yakumo, you’ve misunderstood something.
 I heard everything about you and Kurenai Sensei from Old Man Unkai.
 Stop, Naruto!
 Listen up. Kurenai Sensei sealed your powers
 because she cares about you!
 What’re you talking about?!
 You’re not the only one who’s suffering!
 Kurenai Sensei hid the truth all this time and has suffered alone!
 Stop!
 The…truth…?
 The Supposed Sealed Ability
 Guy Sensei!
 Hey, where is everyone?!
 Shino and Hinata are standing watch in the hallway,
 but Kurenai Sensei and Naruto
 are now inside the world created by Yakumo’s Genjutsu!
 Huh? What do you mean?!
 I’ll explain…
 Mr. Unkai, you should take it easy.
 No… I must now explain the truth…
 Nobody has taken such affectionate care of Yakumo as Kurenai.
 Kurenai’s resolve was to get Yakumo to give up on being a Shinobi…
 Yakumo was completely in low spirits.
 Lord Murakumo was also concerned…
 Then one day, that incident occurred…
 The residence of the head family burned to the ground
 and Yakumo stood motionless in front of it…
 I saw it at that time…
 The form of a monster with a face like a female demon
 hovering in the flames…!
 After learning of its identity… I became frozen with terror.
 What is…the truth?!
 Sensei… What the heck is happening to Yakumo…?
 This is bad…!
 Yakumo! You don’t know…
 You don’t know anything!
 Something’s… Yes…
 There is something… in the recesses of my mind…
 But… What is it…? I can’t remember…
 Oh no…!
 Naruto, stop that!
 Huh?!
 Naruto!
 What is this thing?! Damn it. Let me go!
 All I want to do is live up to everyone’s expectations, and yours.
 And yet… Why does everyone get in my way?
 I just want to become a Genjutsu user…
 People have their respective appropriate paths.
 You probably have your own path.
 That’s right…
 There’s no need to force yourself to become a Shinobi…
 No… I don’t want that!
 Everyone may comfort me with words…
 But I know. I know they’re disappointed in me.
 I can’t stand having to live my whole life feeling that burden.
 Yakumo, what’s that…?
 R-Run, Uroko!
 Yakumo!
 I remember…
 Yakumo…?!
 Yes…me…
 The person inside me killed my mother and father…!
 I killed them with Genjutsu!
 No, Yakumo! That wasn’t you…
 You and that monster are different!
 No, we’re not different…
 You see, that thing… was living inside my heart.
 Thanks… Kurenai Sensei…
 Goodbye…
 Stop!
 Yakumo!
 Wh-What’s…that…?!
 In order for us to get a clear picture of the incident,
 we first requested a complete examination of Yakumo…
 As a result, we learned the monster that appeared at the time of the fire
 was an Id Monster so to speak, created by Yakumo’s sub-consciousness.
 An Id…Monster…
 Then I made a direct appeal to the Third Hokage…
 Ultimately, Yakumo could not endure the weight
 of living up to our expectations from the time she was little
 and that triggered her sub-consciousness to attempt to expunge everything.
 Yakumo’s sub-consciousness will probably attempt to
 expunge the Kurama Clan and eventually the entire Leaf Village.
 I cannot consent to that…
 Despite such a risk,
 taking the life of Yakumo who has no awareness of evil cannot be allowed!
 It’ll be too late
 once her sub-consciousness completely awakens!
 Then we just have to get her to learn how to control it herself…
 or seal her powers if that’s not possible.
 But…
 Although slightly different from Yakumo’s case…
 There’s a precedent of a baby being used to seal the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit.
 That’s absurd…!
 There isn’t a Jutsu practitioner
 who can seal the strong powers Yakumo possesses…
 There might be just one person who can accomplish that…
 However, it will become a painful mission.
 Hopefully, this person can teach her how to control her powers…
 But if it comes to sealing her powers,
 the Jutsu practitioner will end up erasing all the potential in the child…
 The Jutsu practitioner will have to live with the burden
 of Yakumo’s resentment in place of the Kurama Clan…
 The Third Hokage said that and then cried.
 The one who accepted that painful mission was…
 Yuhi Kurenai.
 I see…
 So that’s what Kurenai Sensei was talking about.
 I…didn’t know anything about Sensei…
 I knew that Kurenai had sealed Yakumo’s powers…
 But it’s the first time I’ve heard
 about the incident her sub-consciousness caused.
 Yes… The Third Hokage passed away
 and at this point, it’s a secret known only to the Kurama Clan and Yuhi Kurenai.
 She made herself into the bad guy and kept the secret, huh…?
 Kurenai Sensei…!
 You go, too!
 –But… 					–Sakura…
 I’ll take over things here…!
 Guy Sensei…
 You’re concerned about Naruto and the others, right?
 Go to them…!
 Right!
 I leave Yakumo…to you…
 What is it…?
 I don’t know… But…
 This feeling…
 It’s somehow entirely different from before…
 My insects are acting strange.
 What’s going on inside?! ls Kurenai Sensei okay?
 It’s powerful…
 A massive Chakra beyond compare is being produced…!
 Naruto…
 Why…? Why do you have to take your own life…?
 What…?!
 What must be destroyed are the ones
 who forced you to shoulder a heavy burden
 and on top of that, tried to eliminate me…!
 Who’re you…?
 I crept into an opening in the depths of your mind and was nurtured.
 My name is Id…!
 She’s finally awoken…
 Kurenai Sensei, what is that thing?
 It happened soon after I was made Yakumo’s personal instructor.
 It was when I had doubts about the high level of Yakumo’s Genjutsu
 and looked into her deep psyche.
 I discovered that thing!
 I could only stand motionless in front of that terrible figure.
 It wasn’t Yakumo whom the Third Hokage said to eliminate…
 It was her Id monster…
 So that’s what it was…?
 This ominous ghastliness… is more powerful than before.
 But I must stop it from getting into the real world,
 even if we have to kill each other…!
 Kill each other?! 					I see…
 She was that determined…
 So that’s why she quit Squad Eight.
 I’ll take your feelings into this body and settle the score…
 You jerk!
 You’re in the way. Move it!
 Naruto!
 I don’t know what the heck you are…
 But Kiba, Shino, Hinata, they’re all waiting for Sensei’s return!
 Naruto…!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 My Jutsu won’t activate in this world…!
 You are a thorn in my side… I’ll erase you first.
 Look out!
 Yakumo, you’re the only one who can defeat it now!
 What…?
 Listen, Yakumo… All people have a fanged beast in their minds…
 It always lives in the depths of a person’s mind
 and will suddenly appear.
 The power of the beast that appears is enormous and
 regardless of one’s own will, it can inadvertently hurt those around it.
 But…if that monster can be tamed
 and then controlled with one’s own power…
 It becomes a magnificent power
 and acts to make your dreams come true.
 Now, fight!
 Abate by your own hand the monster you created!
 B-But…
 Yakumo, only you can do this!
 Die, boy…
 Darkness in my mind, abate!
 Die!
 Why…? 					I…served…you well…
 Kurenai Sensei, you’re back to normal!
 Kurenai…Sensei…
 You did well, Yakumo… You defeated your own darkness.
 Sensei…
 You did it, Yakumo…
 Yakumo…
 She knew exactly who was really trying to save her…
 –Kurenai Sensei! 					–Sensei…
 It’s okay now!
 Kurenai Sensei…
 You’ll go back to being everyone’s teacher, right?
 That’s right…
 My final mission from the Third Hokage is over…
 –Sensei! 					–Sensei!
 That’s great that things could get back to normal…
 Sakura…!
 Naruto…?
 I will too.
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 Even if rains of spears were to fall, I will run through it
 Because I want to find the joy without a shape
 This big dream of mine that cannot be translated to words,
 I will make it come true, even if it were to deepen my wounds
 We stand here today because of what we believed through,
 That is why I will continue running forward, never looking away
 Even if I’m told that there is no bright future
 I’ll change it right away, lighting it with all my feeling
 The wind is probably testing our hearts
 In my heart, I gently grasped my hands
 You are probably searching for the answer to your tears
 Your dream is always waiting near by, with the answers in its hands
 The Key to the rusted heart’s door
 Will always be smiling right near by
 This isn’t funny!
 Why do we have to get all worn out for someone like him?
 Exactly! We were told to protect the Beauty of Nature,
 but he keeps getting in our way. ls this some kind of joke?
 Plus, he uses people as scapegoats and shields.
 He thinks it’s only natural for Shinobi to die in missions.
 I can’t take this anymore!
 Me neither. lf it comes to this, then I’m…
 – …gonna use Rasengan! – …gonna use Gatsuuga!
 – And beat up this client up so bad! – And beat up this client up so bad!

217,"A long time ago, a powerful demon fox appeared with nine tails.
 With its powerful tails,
 it could smash mountains and create tidal waves.
 A band of Ninjas rose to defend their village from attack.
 We have to wait until the Fourth Hokage gets here!
 We can't let it get any closer to our village!
 One great Ninja was able to imprison the monster,
 but died in the process.
 This Ninja was known as… the Fourth Hokage.
 Naruto!
 Why did you do such a thing?!
 You're really gonna get it this time!
 I don't care!
 You know your problem?
 You can't do the things I do!
 Only I can do this!
 I'm better than all of you! Believe it!
 There's a problem, sir!
 Lord Hokage!
 What is it?
 Did that Naruto do something again?
 Yes. He climbed onto the Mountainside Images…
 And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!
 Wait!
 Ha ha…
 Why should I?
 Hey, Naruto!
 How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?
 The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?
 Now listen, Naruto.
 You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.
 This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!
 We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!
 Even those who already passed will take it!
 Whaaaat?!
 Sakura Haruno. Here I go…
 Transform!
 OK!
 I did it!
 Cha!
 Did you see that, Sasuke?
 Next, Sasuke Uchiha.
 Yes.
 O-OK.
 Next, Naruto Uzumaki.
 This is a real pain.
 And it's all your fault.
 Like I care!!
 OK…
 Good luck, Naruto…
 Transform!
 How was it?
 I call it the ""Sexy Jutsu""!
 You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!
 Darn…
 Darn…
 I won't let you go home unless you clean that all up.
 I don't care…
 There's nobody home anyway.
 Naruto...
 What is it this time?
 What I meant was…
 If you clean up all that mess, I'll buy you ramen tonight.
 Huh?!
 Yes! I-I will finish it no time!
 Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
 Naruto.
 Why did you vandalize those faces?
 Don't you know who the Hokage leaders are?
 Of course, I do!
 I know they earned the title Lord Hokage
 because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?
 Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero
 who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.
 Then why did you do that?
 Because I'll become a Hokage myself.
 And I'll be the greatest Hokage of all time!
 So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!
 By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.
 You want another bowl?
 Mmmm…No…
 Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?
 This?
 No no!
 This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.
 Tomorrow, you will…
 You're so mean!
 So that's why you took off your goggles…
 Humph... One more bowl please!
 We are now about to begin the graduation test.
 When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.
 The test is on the Clone Jutsu.
 Oh no…
 Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!
 But still… I will do it no matter what!
 Clone Jutsu!
 Disqualified!
 Iruka Sensei.
 His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.
 And he managed to come up with something.
 Isn't that enough for him to pass?
 Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.
 Naruto created just one.
 And it's practically useless. I can't give him a passing mark.
 I 'm a Ninja now!
 You did well. That's my son.
 Congratulations for your graduation.
 I'll cook something good tonight!
 Look at that one.
 It's that boy. I hear he's the only one who failed.
 Serves him right.
 Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.
 Isn't that the boy who is actually…
 Hey! We're not supposed to talk about that.
 Iruka. We need to talk later.
 Yes, sir.
 Iruka Sensei isn't trying to be mean to you.
 Then why only me?
 He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.
 You both don't have parents.
 But I really wanted to graduate.
 Heh... I guess I have no choice…
 I'll let you in on a big secret.
 Secret?
 Iruka.
 What is it, Lord Hokage?
 I know how you feel. But…
 Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parents…like you.
 Let me go!
 My mom and dad are still out there fighting!
 Wake up, Iruka Sensei!
 What's the matter?
 Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!
 I heard that Naruto… stole the Scroll of Sealing.
 The Scroll of Sealing?!
 Let's see…
 The first Jutsu is… Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?
 What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?
 Lord Hokage! We can't forgive him!
 This is not just a prank!
 The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!
 Depending on its use…
 It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!
 Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!
 Yes, sir!
 Where did you go…Naruto?
 I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Naruto…
 Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!
 Hey you, Naruto!
 You found me..
 And I've only learned one Jutsu.
 He's been practicing the Jutsu…
 until he's become this exhausted and dirty…?
 Listen, listen! I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!
 You're gonna let me graduate if I can do it!
 Isn't it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?
 Who told you that?
 Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this place…
 Mizuki did?!
 I'm impressed you found this place.
 I see now…how it is.
 Naruto, give me that scroll.
 Wait, wait… What's going on here?
 Naruto! Never give him that scroll!
 It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.
 Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!
 W-Wha--?
 Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!
 Huh?
 What are you saying, Mizuki! Don't let him fool you, Naruto!
 I will tell you the truth.
 Idiot! Don't do that!
 After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.
 A rule?
 That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.
 Except me?! 					What is it?
 Stop it, Mizuki!
 The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!
 Huh?
 You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,
 who killed Iruka's parents and destroyed our village!
 Stop it!
 Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.
 Didn't you find it strange?
 Why everyone hated you so much?
 No! No! No! No! No!
 Naruto…
 Nobody accepts you. That's why Iruka hates you so much!
 Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.
 Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.
 That's why he keeps misbehaving.
 It's the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.
 He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.
 Die, Naruto!
 Naruto! 					Get down!
 Why…?
 Because you and I are the same.
 After my parents died,
 nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.
 I wasn't a good student in school.
 I was the class clown… because I wanted people to notice me.
 I couldn't get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.
 It was so hard.
 Isn't that right, Naruto?
 You felt so lonely…right? And you suffered inside, right?
 I'm sorry, Naruto….
 If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.
 Don't make me laugh!
 Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!
 He's just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!
 Naruto!
 Narutoooooo!
 He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.
 He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!
 Didn't you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.
 No… Naruto…isn't…like that at all!
 All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.
 I'll take care of you later!
 I-I won't let you…
 Well, well.
 Mizuki has a big mouth!
 Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.
 He might unleash the power locked up inside him.
 The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.
 There's a slight chance he might actually release
 the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!
 If that happens…
 I've found him!
 Naruto!
 Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!
 Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!
 It can't be…
 Why is it, Naruto?
 How…
 did you know I wasn't Iruka…?
 Because I'm Iruka.
 I see.
 What's in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?
 I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!
 You're the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.
 Same?
 Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.
 There is no way that that monster…
 that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage of the power of that scroll!
 You're right…
 I guess it was true all along!
 See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!
 ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.
 But Naruto is different!
 I know that he is an exceptional student.
 He works very hard,
 and he's single-minded and clumsy at the same time.
 No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.
 He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.
 He's Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!
 You are so gullible. 					lruka!
 I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.
 Die!
 I guess this is the end for me…
 Naruto?!
 You surprised me there, freak.
 If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I'll kill you!
 Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!
 Why don't you try then? I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!
 Let's see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Naruto! You've…
 Those aren't just images but actual clones! That's an advanced Ninjutsu!
 What's this…?
 What's the matter? 					C'mon!
 Weren't you gonna get me with one blow? Here!
 In that case… I'll come to you.
 I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?
 Yeah.
 He's really something.
 Maybe it is true.
 Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leaders…
 Naruto, come over here. I'd like to give you something.
 Has anyone found Naruto yet?
 No.
 Darn, this is going to be bad…
 There's no need to worry anymore.
 Lord Hokage!
 He'll be back soon.
 Sensei, how much longer?
 OK, you may open your eyes now.
 Congratulations…on your graduation.
 In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!
 Iruka Sensei!
 That hurts!
 Naruto…
 I was going to lecture to you...
 that the road gets more difficult now that you're a Ninja.
 But I guess I'll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen stand…
 W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!
 You're smaller than me and
 you're saying that you're gonna become the Fifth Hokage?
 I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's grandson or not.
 It's not that easy to be a Hokage!
 If you want it that bad, you're gonna have to beat me first!
 Next episode:  ""My Name Is Konohamaru!""
 Watch my outstanding performance!
